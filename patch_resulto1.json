      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: Root Cause: The `getNumericalMean` function itself seems correct in its calculation, but if used improperly elsewhere in the sampling logic, it could lead to invalid sampling results. The error could arise during the initialization or sampling logic that involves underflow, overflow, or incorrect conversions leading to negative sample values.\n\n### Patch Suggestions:\n\n####\nSuggestion: Review Sampling Logic\nIf the mean calculation is used to drive sampling, ensure that any calculations using it are correctly handling the range of possible values. The bug might originate in how sampling is performed or in adjustments that involve mean calculations. This isn't directly related to `getNumericalMean`, so fix might involve reviewing another part of the code.\n\n####\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This might involve modifying constraints or adding exceptions when unexpected results occur.\n\nThese suggestions focus on identifying potential logic or arithmetic issues outside the `getNumericalMean` itself that may be causing the negative sample values.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function"
