    "The root cause of this bug is that the function does not check if the index is within the bounds of the 'values' array before trying to access it. This is why it throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException instead of an IllegalArgumentException when the record is inconsistent.": [
      "Check Index Bounds Before Accessing Array\nCheck if the index is within the bounds of the 'values' array before trying to access it. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the index is greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the 'values' array. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic String get(final String name) {\n    if (mapping == null) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\n                \"No header mapping was specified, the record values can't be accessed by name\");\n    }\n    final Integer index = mapping.get(name);\n    if (index != null && index >= 0 && index < values.length) {\n        return values[index.intValue()];\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The record is inconsistent\");\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Use Try-Catch Block to Handle Exception\nUse a try-catch block to catch the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and throw an IllegalArgumentException instead. This approach is less efficient than the first one but can also solve the problem. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic String get(final String name) {\n    if (mapping == null) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\n                \"No header mapping was specified, the record values can't be accessed by name\");\n    }\n    final Integer index = mapping.get(name);\n    try {\n        return index != null ? values[index.intValue()] : null;\n    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The record is inconsistent\");\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Validate Mapping Before Accessing Array\nValidate the mapping before trying to access the 'values' array. This can be done by checking if the mapping is consistent before trying to access the array. If the mapping is not consistent, throw an IllegalArgumentException. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic String get(final String name) {\n    if (mapping == null) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\n                \"No header mapping was specified, the record values can't be accessed by name\");\n    }\n    if (!isConsistent()) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"The record is inconsistent\");\n    }\n    final Integer index = mapping.get(name);\n    return index != null ? values[index.intValue()] : null;\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `isConsistent()` method is assumed to be a method that checks if the mapping is consistent."
