    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to integer overflow during the calculation of the mean. The product of getSampleSize() and getNumberOfSuccesses() can exceed the maximum limit of an integer, causing the result to wrap around to a negative value. This negative value is then used as the numerator in the calculation of the mean, resulting in an incorrect and potentially negative mean value.": [
      "Use Long Arithmetic\nUse long data type to store the product of getSampleSize() and getNumberOfSuccesses() to avoid integer overflow. This can be done by casting one of the operands to long before performing the multiplication. Here's the modified code:\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) ((long) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n```\nThis approach is simple and efficient, but it may still overflow if the product is larger than the maximum limit of a long.",
      "Use Double Arithmetic\nUse double data type to store the product of getSampleSize() and getNumberOfSuccesses() to avoid integer overflow. This can be done by casting one of the operands to double before performing the multiplication. Here's the modified code:\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n```\nThis approach is more robust than the previous one, as it uses floating-point arithmetic to avoid overflow. However, it may still lose precision if the product is very large.",
      "Use BigInteger Arithmetic\nUse BigInteger data type to store the product of getSampleSize() and getNumberOfSuccesses() to avoid integer overflow. This can be done by converting the operands to BigInteger before performing the multiplication. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nimport java.math.BigInteger;\n\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    BigInteger numerator = BigInteger.valueOf(getSampleSize()).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(getNumberOfSuccesses()));\n    BigInteger denominator = BigInteger.valueOf(getPopulationSize());\n    return numerator.doubleValue() / denominator.doubleValue();\n}\n```\nThis approach is the most robust, as it uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic to avoid overflow. However, it may be slower than the previous approaches due to the overhead of BigInteger operations."
