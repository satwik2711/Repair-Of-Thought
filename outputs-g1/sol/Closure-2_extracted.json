    "** The NullPointerException occurs because the implicitProto object is null when the interfaceType is a proxy to a non-existent object. This is a bad type annotation, but it shouldn't crash. The current implementation does not handle this case properly.\n\n**": [
      "Add a null check for implicitProto**\nAdd a simple null check before trying to get the property names of the implicitProto object. This will prevent the NullPointerException from occurring.\n\n```java\nif (implicitProto != null) {\n    currentPropertyNames = implicitProto.getOwnPropertyNames();\n} else {\n    // Handle the case where implicitProto is null\n    // For example, return an empty set or throw a custom exception\n    currentPropertyNames = Collections.emptySet();\n}\n```\n\n**",
      "Use the Optional class to handle null values**\nUse the Optional class to handle the case where implicitProto is null. This will make the code more concise and expressive.\n\n```java\ncurrentPropertyNames = Optional.ofNullable(implicitProto)\n    .map(ObjectType::getOwnPropertyNames)\n    .orElse(Collections.emptySet());\n```\n\n**",
      "Throw a custom exception**\nInstead of returning an empty set or handling the null case silently, throw a custom exception to indicate that the interface type is invalid. This will make it easier to diagnose and handle the issue.\n\n```java\nif (implicitProto == null) {\n    throw new InvalidInterfaceTypeException(interfaceType);\n}\ncurrentPropertyNames = implicitProto.getOwnPropertyNames();\n```\n\n**",
      "Return early if implicitProto is null**\nIf the implicitProto object is null, it's likely that the interface type is invalid. In this case, we can return early from the method to prevent further processing.\n\n```java\nif (implicitProto == null) {\n    return;\n}\ncurrentPropertyNames = implicitProto.getOwnPropertyNames();\n```\n\nEach of these suggestions has its own trade-offs and advantages. The choice of which one to use depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project."
