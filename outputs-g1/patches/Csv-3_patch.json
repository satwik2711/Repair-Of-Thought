      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of this bug is that the readEscape() function does not correctly handle the '\\\\N' escape sequence. The function does not have a case for 'N' in its switch statement, so it falls through to the default case and returns the character 'N' without interpreting it as an escape sequence. This results in the lexer not correctly handling the '\\\\N' escape sequence.\nSuggestion: Add a case for 'N' in the switch statement\nAdd a case for 'N' in the switch statement to correctly handle the '\\\\N' escape sequence. This could return a special value to indicate a null value, such as -1 or a custom constant. For example:\n```java\ncase 'N':\n    return NULL_VALUE; // or -1, or a custom constant\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and directly addresses the issue.\n// Buggy Function\nint readEscape() throws IOException {\n    // the escape char has just been read (normally a backslash)\n    final int c = in.read();\n    switch (c) {\n    case 'r':\n        return CR;\n    case 'n':\n        return LF;\n    case 't':\n        return TAB;\n    case 'b':\n        return BACKSPACE;\n    case 'f':\n        return FF;\n    case CR:\n    case LF:\n    case FF: // TODO is this correct?\n    case TAB: // TODO is this correct?
