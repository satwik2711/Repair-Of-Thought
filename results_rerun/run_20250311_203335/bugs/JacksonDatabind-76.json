We'll get copies but...\n[Issue Title]: Missing properties when deserializing using a builder class with a non-default constructor and a mutator annotated with @JsonUnwrapped\n[Issue Description]: When deserializing using a builder class with a non-default constructor and any number of mutator methods annotated with @JsonUnwrapped, the BuilderBasedDeserializer::deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped method cuts short the process of adding SettableBeanProperties.\nThe logic dictates that once all properties necessary to construct the builder have been found, the builder is constructed using all known SettableBeanProperties that have been found up to that point in the tokenizing process.\nTherefore, in the case that the builder has a single property required for construction, and that property is found anywhere other than at the end of the JSON content, any properties subsequent to the constructor property are not evaluated and are left with their default values.\nGiven the following classes:\n@JsonDeserialize(builder = Employee.Builder.class)\npublic class Employee {\n    private final long id;\n    private final Name name;\n    private final int age;\n\n    private Employee(Builder builder) {\n        id = builder.id;\n        name = builder.name;\n        age = builder.age;\n    }\n\n    public long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public Name getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    @JsonPOJOBuilder(withPrefix = \"set\")\n    public static class Builder {\n        private final long id;\n        private Name name;\n        private int age;\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        public Builder(@JsonProperty(\"emp_id\") long id) {\n            this.id = id;\n        }\n\n        @JsonUnwrapped\n        public void setName(Name name) {\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_age\")\n        public void setAge(int age) {\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n\n        public Employee build() {\n            return new Employee(this);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Name {\n    private final String first;\n    private final String last;\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    public Name(\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_first_name\") String first,\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_last_name\") String last\n    ) {\n        this.first = first;\n        this.last = last;\n    }\n\n    public String getFirst() {\n        return first;\n    }\n\n    public String getLast() {\n        return last;\n    }\n}\nAnd given the following JSON string:\n{\n    \"emp_age\": 30,\n    \"emp_id\": 1234,\n    \"emp_first_name\": \"John\",\n    \"emp_last_name\": \"Doe\"\n}\nWe will see the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge()); // 30\nSystem.out.println(emp.getId()); // 1234\nSystem.out.println(emp.getName()); // null\nHowever, if we place the emp_id property at the end of the JSON string, we would get the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge()); // 30\nSystem.out.println(emp.getId()); // 1234\nSystem.out.println(emp.getName()); // Name Object\nIf we were to place emp_age and emp_first_name and emp_last_name all after the emp_id property in the JSON string, we would get the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge());

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** The buggy code prematurely builds the bean and returns as soon as it finds and assigns the first creator property within the loop. This prevents subsequent properties in the JSON from being processed, especially unwrapped properties.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch removes the bean building and return logic from within the `if (buffer.assignParameter(...))` block. It only assigns the creator property and continues processing the rest of the JSON input. The bean is built only after processing all properties in the loop.\n- **Generated Patch:** The generated patch also removes the bean building and return logic from within the `if (buffer.assignParameter(...))` block. It introduces a `t = p.nextToken(); continue;` after assigning the creator property, which is slightly different from the ground truth but functionally similar in this context. Both patches ensure that the loop continues to process all properties.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The generated patch has an extra `t = p.nextToken(); continue;` within the `if` block. In the buggy code, `t` is updated in the outer loop `for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken())`.  The `t = p.nextToken();` in the generated patch might seem redundant, but in this specific control flow, it doesn't drastically alter the behavior. Both patches prevent premature return and allow all properties to be processed.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input):** Both patches will correctly deserialize the JSON and return the expected bean object, including unwrapped properties, regardless of the order of properties in the JSON.\n- **Missing/null values:** Both patches should handle missing or null values in the same way as the original code, as the core deserialization logic for individual properties is unchanged.\n- **Out of bounds values/Invalid inputs:**  Error handling for invalid input types or formats should remain consistent in both patches, as the error handling parts of the code are not modified.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Both patches retain the original error handling structure. The `try-catch` block around `creator.build(ctxt, buffer)` remains in place to handle potential exceptions during bean construction. The `wrapInstantiationProblem` and `wrapAndThrow` methods are also unchanged. Error handling behavior should be identical in both patches.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Will patch pass the trigger test?** Yes, both the ground truth and generated patches are designed to fix the bug highlighted by the trigger tests. By removing the premature return, they ensure that all properties, including those after the creator property, are processed, thus resolving the issue of missing unwrapped properties.\n- **Are there potential issues with other tests?** No, it is unlikely that these patches will introduce issues in other tests. The change is focused on correcting a specific control flow error in handling property-based deserialization with unwrapped properties. It makes the deserialization process more robust and correct.\n- **Could behavior changes affect dependent code?** No, the behavior change is a correction of a bug. Dependent code should benefit from the corrected deserialization logic, as it will now correctly handle cases with unwrapped properties and creator properties in various orders.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** The AST similarity scores are moderate, reflecting the code change within the `if` block.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** High control flow similarity suggests that the overall control flow remains largely the same, which is true as the main loop structure is preserved.\n- **LLM-based validation:** The LLM incorrectly assesses equivalence as 0.0. LLMs can sometimes be overly sensitive to minor code differences and may not fully grasp semantic equivalence in control flow changes like this.\n- **Combined assessment:** The combined assessment of 0.70 confidence suggests some uncertainty, likely due to the code removal being flagged as a change. However, based on manual analysis, the patches are semantically very close in terms of fixing the bug.\n\n[Classification]\nBased on the analysis, both the ground truth patch and the generated patch effectively address the bug by removing the premature bean construction and return statement within the `if (buffer.assignParameter(...))` block.  While the generated patch includes an extra `t = p.nextToken(); continue;` which is not strictly necessary and slightly deviates from the ground truth, it does not introduce new errors and still correctly fixes the reported issue. Functionally, both patches achieve the desired outcome of processing all properties before building the bean, thus resolving the bug and passing the trigger tests.\n\nTherefore, considering that the generated patch fixes the core issue and exhibits the correct behavior, despite a minor stylistic difference, it can be classified as **PLAUSIBLE**. It is not perfectly semantically identical to the ground truth in terms of code structure due to the extra lines, but it is functionally equivalent in resolving the bug.\n\n[Classification]: PLAUSIBLE",

We'll get copies but...\n[Issue Title]: Missing properties when deserializing using a builder class with a non-default constructor and a mutator annotated with @JsonUnwrapped\n[Issue Description]: When deserializing using a builder class with a non-default constructor and any number of mutator methods annotated with @JsonUnwrapped, the BuilderBasedDeserializer::deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped method cuts short the process of adding SettableBeanProperties.\nThe logic dictates that once all properties necessary to construct the builder have been found, the builder is constructed using all known SettableBeanProperties that have been found up to that point in the tokenizing process.\nTherefore, in the case that the builder has a single property required for construction, and that property is found anywhere other than at the end of the JSON content, any properties subsequent to the constructor property are not evaluated and are left with their default values.\nGiven the following classes:\n@JsonDeserialize(builder = Employee.Builder.class)\npublic class Employee {\n    private final long id;\n    private final Name name;\n    private final int age;\n\n    private Employee(Builder builder) {\n        id = builder.id;\n        name = builder.name;\n        age = builder.age;\n    }\n\n    public long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public Name getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    @JsonPOJOBuilder(withPrefix = \"set\")\n    public static class Builder {\n        private final long id;\n        private Name name;\n        private int age;\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        public Builder(@JsonProperty(\"emp_id\") long id) {\n            this.id = id;\n        }\n\n        @JsonUnwrapped\n        public void setName(Name name) {\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_age\")\n        public void setAge(int age) {\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n\n        public Employee build() {\n            return new Employee(this);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Name {\n    private final String first;\n    private final String last;\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    public Name(\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_first_name\") String first,\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_last_name\") String last\n    ) {\n        this.first = first;\n        this.last = last;\n    }\n\n    public String getFirst() {\n        return first;\n    }\n\n    public String getLast() {\n        return last;\n    }\n}\nAnd given the following JSON string:\n{\n    \"emp_age\": 30,\n    \"emp_id\": 1234,\n    \"emp_first_name\": \"John\",\n    \"emp_last_name\": \"Doe\"\n}\nWe will see the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge()); // 30\nSystem.out.println(emp.getId()); // 1234\nSystem.out.println(emp.getName()); // null\nHowever, if we place the emp_id property at the end of the JSON string, we would get the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge()); // 30\nSystem.out.println(emp.getId()); // 1234\nSystem.out.println(emp.getName()); // Name Object\nIf we were to place emp_age and emp_first_name and emp_last_name all after the emp_id property in the JSON string, we would get the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge());

The root cause is that when the creator has multiple parameters, the function doesn't correctly buffer the properties, causing some to be lost during deserialization. The suggestion is to use a separate buffer for creator properties.\n\nLet me look at the original code. The function is called deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped. It uses a PropertyValueBuffer called buffer which is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). Then, it reads tokens and processes each field.\n\nIn the loop, when a creator property is found, it assigns the parameter to the buffer. If assignParameter returns true, it tries to build the bean immediately. But if the creator has multiple parameters, this approach might not capture all of them because it builds the bean as soon as one parameter is assigned, potentially missing others.\n\nThe fix suggests using a separate buffer for creator properties. So, I'll create a new PropertyValueBuffer called creatorBuffer. Then, when a creatorProp is found, I'll assign the deserialized value to creatorBuffer instead of the main buffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, when a creatorProp is found, it's using the main buffer. That's probably the issue because if multiple creator properties are present, the main buffer might not handle them all correctly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n2. When processing a creatorProp, assign the value to creatorBuffer.\n3. After processing all fields, use creatorBuffer to build the bean.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, when a creatorProp is found and assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean immediately. That's probably too early if there are multiple creator properties.\n\nSo, the approach should be to collect all creator properties first, then build the bean once all are processed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize creatorBuffer as a new PropertyValueBuffer.\n- In the loop, when a creatorProp is found, deserialize and assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop. Instead, after the loop ends (when t is not FIELD_NAME), build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, but the original code has a part where after the loop, it builds the bean using the main buffer. That's probably incorrect because the main buffer might not have all the creator properties.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after the loop, we should use creatorBuffer to build the bean.\n\nBut wait, what about the main buffer? It's used for regular properties. So, the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters, and the main buffer is for other properties.\n\nWait, no. The creator parameters are the ones passed to the creator's build method. Other properties are set via setters or other means after the object is created.\n\nSo, the main buffer is for the creator parameters, but in the original code, it's being used incorrectly when there are multiple creator parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code is trying to build the bean as soon as a creator property is found, which is wrong because all creator parameters need to be collected first.\n\nSo, the fix is to collect all creator properties into a separate buffer, and only after all properties are processed, build the bean using that buffer.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- Create creatorBuffer.\n- In the loop, when a creatorProp is found, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code has a part where after the loop, it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is not needed for creator properties anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize creatorBuffer as new PropertyValueBuffer.\n2. In the loop, for each field:\n   a. If it's a creatorProp, deserialize and assign to creatorBuffer.\n   b. Else, handle as regular property, maybe using the main buffer.\n3. After processing all fields, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the main buffer is passed to creator.build(). So, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled elsewhere.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original code, the main buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). Then, for each creatorProp, it's assigned to this buffer. But when multiple creatorProps are present, the code might build the bean too early.\n\nThe fix is to have a separate buffer for creator properties so that all are collected before building.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n- For each creatorProp found, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- After all fields are processed, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part where after the loop, it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the creator.build() method expects all the creator parameters to be in the buffer. So, the main buffer is not the right place for them. So, the creatorBuffer should collect all creator parameters, and then be passed to creator.build().\n\nSo, the fixed code would:\n\n- Have a main buffer for regular properties.\n- Have a creatorBuffer for creator parameters.\n- After processing all tokens, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nBut in the original code, the main buffer is used for both. That's the problem.\n\nSo, in the loop, when a creatorProp is found, we should assign to creatorBuffer, not the main buffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the main buffer is initialized via creator.startBuilding(...), which probably sets up the buffer for the creator parameters.\n\nHmm, perhaps the main buffer is intended for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me look at the original code again.\n\nIn the original code:\n\n- buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- For each field, if it's a creatorProp, it's assigned to buffer.\n- If assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean immediately.\n\nBut when there are multiple creatorProps, building the bean after the first one is incorrect because other parameters are missing.\n\nSo, the fix is to collect all creatorProps into a separate buffer, and only after all are collected, build the bean.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Create a creatorBuffer.\n- For each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part after the loop where it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the token buffer is for the other properties.\n\nIn any case, the key is to ensure that all creator parameters are collected before building the bean.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- We'll have a separate creatorBuffer.\n- When a creatorProp is found, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After processing all tokens, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Initialize creatorBuffer as new PropertyValueBuffer().\n2. In the loop, when a creatorProp is found, deserialize and assign to creatorBuffer.\n3. Remove the code that builds the bean inside the loop.\n4. After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the loop, it's building the bean with the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for the regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is not needed anymore, and all creator parameters go into creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, but the way it's used is incorrect.\n\nI think the correct approach is:\n\n- Use a separate buffer for the creator parameters.\n- Collect all creator properties into this buffer.\n- After all properties are processed, build the bean using this buffer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n- In the loop, for each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nBut then, what about the main buffer? It seems that in the original code, the main buffer is used for both creator and regular properties, which is causing the issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the main buffer should be used for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer for creator parameters.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the main buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...), which suggests it's intended for the creator parameters.\n\nHmm, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the main buffer is not the right place to collect all creator parameters, especially when there are multiple.\n\nSo, the fix is to have a separate buffer for creator parameters, collect all of them, and then build the bean.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- Remove the main buffer initialization with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- Instead, create a creatorBuffer.\n- For each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, but the original code uses the main buffer for regular properties as well. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about how the original code works.\n\nIn the original code:\n\n- buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). So, this buffer is for the creator parameters.\n- For each field, if it's a creatorProp, it's assigned to buffer.\n- If assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean immediately and processes the remaining fields.\n\nThe problem is that when there are multiple creatorProps, building the bean after the first one is incorrect because other parameters are not yet assigned.\n\nSo, the fix is to collect all creatorProps into a separate buffer, and only after all are collected, build the bean.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Create a separate buffer, creatorBuffer, for the creator parameters.\n2. In the loop, for each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n3. Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n4. After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part after the loop where it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- The main buffer is used for regular properties.\n- The creatorBuffer is used for creator parameters.\n- After processing all tokens, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut how does that work with the main buffer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is not needed, and all properties are either creatorProps or regular.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- creatorBuffer is used to collect all creator parameters.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n- The main buffer is not used for creator parameters anymore.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Remove the initialization of buffer with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- Instead, create creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer().\n- For each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nBut then, what about the regular properties? They are handled via the token buffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the regular properties are being written into the tokens, and then processed later.\n\nSo, the fixed code would look like this:\n\n- Initialize creatorBuffer as new PropertyValueBuffer().\n- In the loop, for each field:\n   - If it's a creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n   - Else, handle as regular property, possibly writing to tokens.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n- Then process the tokens for regular properties.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after building the bean, it calls _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(...), which probably handles the regular properties from the tokens.\n\nSo, the key is to make sure that all creatorProps are collected into creatorBuffer before building the bean.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the main changes are:\n\n- Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n- Assign creatorProps to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nSo, let me outline the code:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    // Create a separate buffer for creator properties\n    PropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            // Assign to creatorBuffer instead of the main buffer\n            creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            t = p.nextToken();\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Object Id property?\n        if (buffer.readIdProperty(propName)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // regular property? needs buffering\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = _beanProperties.find(propName);\n        if (prop != null) {\n            buffer.bufferProperty(prop, prop.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (_ignorableProps != null && _ignorableProps.contains(propName)) {\n            handleIgnoredProperty(p, ctxt, handledType(), propName);\n            continue;\n        }\n        tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n        tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n        // \"any property\"?\n        if (_anySetter != null) {\n            buffer.bufferAnyProperty(_anySetter, propName, _anySetter.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n        }\n    }\n\n    // We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). So, perhaps that's necessary for the creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, maybe the creatorBuffer should be initialized by calling creator.startBuilding(...). Let me check the original code.\n\nIn the original code, buffer is initialized as:\n\nPropertyValueBuffer buffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\nSo, perhaps the creatorBuffer should be initialized similarly.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, creatorBuffer is initialized as:\n\nPropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the creator.startBuilding() is called once, and returns a buffer. So, perhaps the original buffer is the creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's buffer is the creatorBuffer, but it's being misused by building the bean too early.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to not build the bean inside the loop, but wait until all creatorProps are collected.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop when a creatorProp is found.\n- After the loop, build the bean using the buffer.\n\nSo, the fixed code would remove the part where it builds the bean inside the loop.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize buffer as creator.startBuilding(...).\n2. In the loop, for each creatorProp, assign to buffer.\n3. Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n4. After the loop, build the bean using buffer.\n\nWait, but that's what the original code does after the loop. So, perhaps the problem is that when multiple creatorProps are present, the code builds the bean too early inside the loop.\n\nSo, the fix is to remove the code that builds the bean inside the loop.\n\nSo, in the original code, inside the loop, when a creatorProp is found and assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean and processes the remaining tokens. This is incorrect when there are multiple creatorProps because it doesn't collect all of them.\n\nSo, the fix is to remove that part and only build the bean after the loop.\n\nSo, the fixed code would:\n\n- Remove the try-catch block inside the loop that builds the bean.\n- After the loop, build the bean once.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    PropertyValueBuffer buffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            if (buffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt))) {\n                t = p.nextToken();\n                // Do not build the bean here; wait until after the loop\n                continue;\n            }\n            continue;\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code remains the same ...\n    }\n\n    // After the loop, build the bean\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, buffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but this approach still uses the same buffer as before. So, perhaps the issue is that when multiple creatorProps are present, the buffer is not correctly handling them because it's being used to build the bean too early.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to have a separate buffer for creatorProps, collect all of them, and then build the bean once.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n- Assign all creatorProps to creatorBuffer.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    // Create a separate buffer for creator properties\n    PropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            t = p.nextToken();\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Object Id property?\n        if (buffer.readIdProperty(propName)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // regular property? needs buffering\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = _beanProperties.find(propName);\n        if (prop != null) {\n            buffer.bufferProperty(prop, prop.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (_ignorableProps != null && _ignorableProps.contains(propName)) {\n            handleIgnoredProperty(p, ctxt, handledType(), propName);\n            continue;\n        }\n        tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n        tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n        // \"any property\"?\n        if (_anySetter != null) {\n            buffer.bufferAnyProperty(_anySetter, propName, _anySetter.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n        }\n    }\n\n    // We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, the buffer variable is not initialized. Because in the original code, buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). So, perhaps we need to initialize creatorBuffer with that.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nPropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\nBut then, what about the regular properties? Are they handled via the token buffer?\n\nI think the key is that the creatorBuffer is used for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer and processed later.\n\nSo, the fixed code would:\n\n- Initialize creatorBuffer with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- In the loop, assign creatorProps to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n- Then process the tokens for regular properties.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    // Create a separate buffer for creator properties\n    PropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            t = p.nextToken();\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Object Id property?\n        if (creatorBuffer.readIdProperty(propName)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // regular property? needs buffering\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = _beanProperties.find(propName);\n        if (prop != null) {\n            // Wait, but creatorBuffer is for creator properties, so regular properties should go elsewhere?\n            // Maybe the main buffer is for regular properties, but in this case, perhaps the token buffer handles them.\n            // So, perhaps we don't need to buffer regular properties here.\n            // Instead, they are written to the tokens and processed later.\n            tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n            tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (_ignorableProps != null && _ignorableProps.contains(propName)) {\n            handleIgnoredProperty(p, ctxt, handledType(), propName);\n            continue;\n        }\n        // \"any property\"?\n        if (_anySetter != null) {\n            // Not sure about this part, perhaps it's handled via tokens.\n            tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n            tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but in this approach, regular properties are not being buffered. Instead, they are written to the tokens and processed later by _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped().\n\nSo, perhaps the main buffer is not needed for regular properties because they are handled via the token buffer.\n\nSo, the fixed code removes the main buffer and uses creatorBuffer for creator properties, and\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation using token analysis: Token similarity: 0.00, Method signature similarity: 0.42, Variable usage similarity: 0.78.

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** The buggy code attempts to optimize deserialization by building the bean as soon as all constructor parameters are available. However, in the case of `@JsonUnwrapped` properties, it prematurely builds the bean within the loop after processing the first creator property, leading to subsequent unwrapped properties being missed if they appear later in the JSON input.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch removes the premature bean building logic from within the loop. It ensures that the bean is built only after processing all properties in the JSON input. This allows all creator properties, including those from `@JsonUnwrapped`, to be collected in the `buffer` before the bean is constructed.\n- **Generated Patch:** The generated patch introduces a new `creatorBuffer` to specifically handle creator properties. It initializes `creatorBuffer` using `creator.startBuilding`, which is the same initialization as the original `buffer` in the buggy code. It then assigns creator properties to this `creatorBuffer`. However, it still uses the original `buffer` variable (which is not initialized in the generated patch snippet, but we assume it's meant to be initialized similarly to the buggy code, or perhaps the intention was to remove it entirely but the patch is incomplete).  Crucially, it builds the bean using `creatorBuffer` after the loop, which is similar to the ground truth in terms of delaying the build process.\n\nBehavioral Differences:\n- **Buggy vs. Ground Truth:** The buggy code builds the bean too early, potentially missing properties. The ground truth patch builds the bean only after processing all properties, fixing the issue.\n- **Generated vs. Ground Truth:** The generated patch attempts to isolate creator properties into `creatorBuffer` and build the bean with it at the end, similar to the ground truth in delaying the build. However, the generated patch introduces a new variable and might have issues with how it handles the original `buffer` and other property types.  The LLM analysis points out that the `buffer` variable is used uninitialized, which is a significant issue.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- All patches should handle normal cases correctly when all properties are present and in the expected order.\n- The buggy code fails when creator properties are not at the end and `@JsonUnwrapped` properties follow the initial creator property.\n- The ground truth patch should correctly handle all orderings of properties, including cases with `@JsonUnwrapped`.\n- The generated patch's behavior is uncertain due to the potential uninitialized `buffer` and unclear handling of non-creator properties. If `buffer` is indeed uninitialized or incorrectly used, it will likely fail in various scenarios.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- All patches are expected to return the deserialized bean object in normal cases.\n- In case of errors during deserialization or bean creation, they should throw exceptions or return null as appropriate within the Jackson framework's error handling mechanisms.\n- The key difference is in *when* the bean is created and *which properties are considered* at creation time, not in the return value type itself.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- The buggy code, ground truth, and generated patch all include try-catch blocks around the `creator.build()` call to handle potential exceptions during bean instantiation.\n- The error handling strategy is consistent across all three in terms of wrapping and re-throwing instantiation problems.\n- The difference lies in *when* these errors might occur. The buggy code might throw errors earlier if it attempts to build an incomplete bean.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Tests:** The ground truth patch is designed to pass the trigger tests, which specifically target the bug of missing unwrapped properties when creator parameters are not at the end. The generated patch, due to its likely incorrect implementation (uninitialized `buffer` usage), is unlikely to pass these tests. The error messages from the trigger tests indicate failures related to missing unwrapped properties, which is exactly the bug the ground truth patch fixes and the generated patch seems to misunderstand or incorrectly address.\n- **Other Tests:** The ground truth patch is a minimal and targeted fix, unlikely to cause regressions. The generated patch, being more invasive and potentially flawed, has a higher risk of introducing regressions if the `buffer` handling is indeed broken as suggested by the semantic analysis.\n- **Dependent Code:** The ground truth patch's behavior change is to correctly handle `@JsonUnwrapped` properties in property-based deserialization with builders, which is a bug fix and should improve correctness without negatively impacting dependent code. The generated patch's behavior is unpredictable and potentially incorrect, so it could negatively affect dependent code if it introduces new bugs.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Shows low token and structure similarity, indicating significant code changes in terms of structure.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Control flow similarity is moderate, suggesting some overlap in control flow but also differences.\n- **LLM-based validation:**  Strongly indicates non-equivalence with high confidence, specifically pointing out the introduction of `creatorBuffer` and the *incorrect usage of the uninitialized variable `buffer`*. This is a critical finding.\n- **Combined assessment:**  Confirms non-equivalence with high confidence.\n\nThe semantic equivalence results, especially the LLM-based validation highlighting the uninitialized `buffer` issue, strongly suggest that the generated patch is flawed and not semantically equivalent to the ground truth.\n\n[Classification]\n**INCORRECT**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe generated patch, while seemingly attempting to address the issue by introducing a separate `creatorBuffer` and delaying bean construction, is fundamentally flawed due to the likely incorrect and uninitialized usage of the original `buffer` variable. The semantic equivalence tests, particularly the LLM-based validation, clearly point out this critical flaw. The generated patch deviates significantly from the ground truth patch, which provides a minimal and correct fix by simply removing the premature bean building logic. The trigger tests are designed to expose the exact bug that the ground truth patch fixes, and the generated patch is highly unlikely to pass these tests due to its likely broken implementation. The introduction of `creatorBuffer` without proper handling of the original `buffer` and other property types indicates a misunderstanding of the correct fix and leads to an incorrect patch.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the code, the issue description, the trigger tests, the ground truth patch, and especially the strong negative semantic equivalence results, the generated patch is classified as **INCORRECT**.",

        "generated_patch": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the provided Java function. The root cause is that when the creator has multiple parameters, the function doesn't correctly buffer the properties, causing some to be lost during deserialization. The suggestion is to use a separate buffer for creator properties.\n\nLet me look at the original code. The function is called deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped. It uses a PropertyValueBuffer called buffer which is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). Then, it reads tokens and processes each field.\n\nIn the loop, when a creator property is found, it assigns the parameter to the buffer. If assignParameter returns true, it tries to build the bean immediately. But if the creator has multiple parameters, this approach might not capture all of them because it builds the bean as soon as one parameter is assigned, potentially missing others.\n\nThe fix suggests using a separate buffer for creator properties. So, I'll create a new PropertyValueBuffer called creatorBuffer. Then, when a creatorProp is found, I'll assign the deserialized value to creatorBuffer instead of the main buffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, when a creatorProp is found, it's using the main buffer. That's probably the issue because if multiple creator properties are present, the main buffer might not handle them all correctly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n2. When processing a creatorProp, assign the value to creatorBuffer.\n3. After processing all fields, use creatorBuffer to build the bean.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, when a creatorProp is found and assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean immediately. That's probably too early if there are multiple creator properties.\n\nSo, the approach should be to collect all creator properties first, then build the bean once all are processed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize creatorBuffer as a new PropertyValueBuffer.\n- In the loop, when a creatorProp is found, deserialize and assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop. Instead, after the loop ends (when t is not FIELD_NAME), build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, but the original code has a part where after the loop, it builds the bean using the main buffer. That's probably incorrect because the main buffer might not have all the creator properties.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after the loop, we should use creatorBuffer to build the bean.\n\nBut wait, what about the main buffer? It's used for regular properties. So, the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters, and the main buffer is for other properties.\n\nWait, no. The creator parameters are the ones passed to the creator's build method. Other properties are set via setters or other means after the object is created.\n\nSo, the main buffer is for the creator parameters, but in the original code, it's being used incorrectly when there are multiple creator parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code is trying to build the bean as soon as a creator property is found, which is wrong because all creator parameters need to be collected first.\n\nSo, the fix is to collect all creator properties into a separate buffer, and only after all properties are processed, build the bean using that buffer.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- Create creatorBuffer.\n- In the loop, when a creatorProp is found, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code has a part where after the loop, it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is not needed for creator properties anymore.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize creatorBuffer as new PropertyValueBuffer.\n2. In the loop, for each field:\n   a. If it's a creatorProp, deserialize and assign to creatorBuffer.\n   b. Else, handle as regular property, maybe using the main buffer.\n3. After processing all fields, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the main buffer is passed to creator.build(). So, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled elsewhere.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original code, the main buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). Then, for each creatorProp, it's assigned to this buffer. But when multiple creatorProps are present, the code might build the bean too early.\n\nThe fix is to have a separate buffer for creator properties so that all are collected before building.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n- For each creatorProp found, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- After all fields are processed, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part where after the loop, it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the creator.build() method expects all the creator parameters to be in the buffer. So, the main buffer is not the right place for them. So, the creatorBuffer should collect all creator parameters, and then be passed to creator.build().\n\nSo, the fixed code would:\n\n- Have a main buffer for regular properties.\n- Have a creatorBuffer for creator parameters.\n- After processing all tokens, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nBut in the original code, the main buffer is used for both. That's the problem.\n\nSo, in the loop, when a creatorProp is found, we should assign to creatorBuffer, not the main buffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the main buffer is initialized via creator.startBuilding(...), which probably sets up the buffer for the creator parameters.\n\nHmm, perhaps the main buffer is intended for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me look at the original code again.\n\nIn the original code:\n\n- buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- For each field, if it's a creatorProp, it's assigned to buffer.\n- If assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean immediately.\n\nBut when there are multiple creatorProps, building the bean after the first one is incorrect because other parameters are missing.\n\nSo, the fix is to collect all creatorProps into a separate buffer, and only after all are collected, build the bean.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Create a creatorBuffer.\n- For each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part after the loop where it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the token buffer is for the other properties.\n\nIn any case, the key is to ensure that all creator parameters are collected before building the bean.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- We'll have a separate creatorBuffer.\n- When a creatorProp is found, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After processing all tokens, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Initialize creatorBuffer as new PropertyValueBuffer().\n2. In the loop, when a creatorProp is found, deserialize and assign to creatorBuffer.\n3. Remove the code that builds the bean inside the loop.\n4. After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the loop, it's building the bean with the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for the regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is not needed anymore, and all creator parameters go into creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, but the way it's used is incorrect.\n\nI think the correct approach is:\n\n- Use a separate buffer for the creator parameters.\n- Collect all creator properties into this buffer.\n- After all properties are processed, build the bean using this buffer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n- In the loop, for each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nBut then, what about the main buffer? It seems that in the original code, the main buffer is used for both creator and regular properties, which is causing the issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the main buffer should be used for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer for creator parameters.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the main buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...), which suggests it's intended for the creator parameters.\n\nHmm, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the main buffer is not the right place to collect all creator parameters, especially when there are multiple.\n\nSo, the fix is to have a separate buffer for creator parameters, collect all of them, and then build the bean.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- Remove the main buffer initialization with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- Instead, create a creatorBuffer.\n- For each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, but the original code uses the main buffer for regular properties as well. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about how the original code works.\n\nIn the original code:\n\n- buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). So, this buffer is for the creator parameters.\n- For each field, if it's a creatorProp, it's assigned to buffer.\n- If assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean immediately and processes the remaining fields.\n\nThe problem is that when there are multiple creatorProps, building the bean after the first one is incorrect because other parameters are not yet assigned.\n\nSo, the fix is to collect all creatorProps into a separate buffer, and only after all are collected, build the bean.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Create a separate buffer, creatorBuffer, for the creator parameters.\n2. In the loop, for each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n3. Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n4. After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part after the loop where it builds the bean using the main buffer. So, perhaps the main buffer is for regular properties, and the creatorBuffer is for the creator parameters.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- The main buffer is used for regular properties.\n- The creatorBuffer is used for creator parameters.\n- After processing all tokens, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n\nBut how does that work with the main buffer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main buffer is not needed, and all properties are either creatorProps or regular.\n\nWait, perhaps the main buffer is for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- creatorBuffer is used to collect all creator parameters.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n- The main buffer is not used for creator parameters anymore.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Remove the initialization of buffer with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- Instead, create creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer().\n- For each creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nBut then, what about the regular properties? They are handled via the token buffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the regular properties are being written into the tokens, and then processed later.\n\nSo, the fixed code would look like this:\n\n- Initialize creatorBuffer as new PropertyValueBuffer().\n- In the loop, for each field:\n   - If it's a creatorProp, assign to creatorBuffer.\n   - Else, handle as regular property, possibly writing to tokens.\n- After the loop, build the bean using creatorBuffer.\n- Then process the tokens for regular properties.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after building the bean, it calls _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(...), which probably handles the regular properties from the tokens.\n\nSo, the key is to make sure that all creatorProps are collected into creatorBuffer before building the bean.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the main changes are:\n\n- Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n- Assign creatorProps to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nSo, let me outline the code:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    // Create a separate buffer for creator properties\n    PropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            // Assign to creatorBuffer instead of the main buffer\n            creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            t = p.nextToken();\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Object Id property?\n        if (buffer.readIdProperty(propName)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // regular property? needs buffering\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = _beanProperties.find(propName);\n        if (prop != null) {\n            buffer.bufferProperty(prop, prop.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (_ignorableProps != null && _ignorableProps.contains(propName)) {\n            handleIgnoredProperty(p, ctxt, handledType(), propName);\n            continue;\n        }\n        tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n        tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n        // \"any property\"?\n        if (_anySetter != null) {\n            buffer.bufferAnyProperty(_anySetter, propName, _anySetter.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n        }\n    }\n\n    // We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). So, perhaps that's necessary for the creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, maybe the creatorBuffer should be initialized by calling creator.startBuilding(...). Let me check the original code.\n\nIn the original code, buffer is initialized as:\n\nPropertyValueBuffer buffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\nSo, perhaps the creatorBuffer should be initialized similarly.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, creatorBuffer is initialized as:\n\nPropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the creator.startBuilding() is called once, and returns a buffer. So, perhaps the original buffer is the creatorBuffer.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's buffer is the creatorBuffer, but it's being misused by building the bean too early.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to not build the bean inside the loop, but wait until all creatorProps are collected.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop when a creatorProp is found.\n- After the loop, build the bean using the buffer.\n\nSo, the fixed code would remove the part where it builds the bean inside the loop.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize buffer as creator.startBuilding(...).\n2. In the loop, for each creatorProp, assign to buffer.\n3. Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n4. After the loop, build the bean using buffer.\n\nWait, but that's what the original code does after the loop. So, perhaps the problem is that when multiple creatorProps are present, the code builds the bean too early inside the loop.\n\nSo, the fix is to remove the code that builds the bean inside the loop.\n\nSo, in the original code, inside the loop, when a creatorProp is found and assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean and processes the remaining tokens. This is incorrect when there are multiple creatorProps because it doesn't collect all of them.\n\nSo, the fix is to remove that part and only build the bean after the loop.\n\nSo, the fixed code would:\n\n- Remove the try-catch block inside the loop that builds the bean.\n- After the loop, build the bean once.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    PropertyValueBuffer buffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            if (buffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt))) {\n                t = p.nextToken();\n                // Do not build the bean here; wait until after the loop\n                continue;\n            }\n            continue;\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code remains the same ...\n    }\n\n    // After the loop, build the bean\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, buffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but this approach still uses the same buffer as before. So, perhaps the issue is that when multiple creatorProps are present, the buffer is not correctly handling them because it's being used to build the bean too early.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to have a separate buffer for creatorProps, collect all of them, and then build the bean once.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\n- Create a separate creatorBuffer.\n- Assign all creatorProps to creatorBuffer.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    // Create a separate buffer for creator properties\n    PropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            t = p.nextToken();\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Object Id property?\n        if (buffer.readIdProperty(propName)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // regular property? needs buffering\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = _beanProperties.find(propName);\n        if (prop != null) {\n            buffer.bufferProperty(prop, prop.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (_ignorableProps != null && _ignorableProps.contains(propName)) {\n            handleIgnoredProperty(p, ctxt, handledType(), propName);\n            continue;\n        }\n        tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n        tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n        // \"any property\"?\n        if (_anySetter != null) {\n            buffer.bufferAnyProperty(_anySetter, propName, _anySetter.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n        }\n    }\n\n    // We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, the buffer variable is not initialized. Because in the original code, buffer is initialized with creator.startBuilding(...). So, perhaps we need to initialize creatorBuffer with that.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nPropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\nBut then, what about the regular properties? Are they handled via the token buffer?\n\nI think the key is that the creatorBuffer is used for the creator parameters, and the regular properties are handled via the token buffer and processed later.\n\nSo, the fixed code would:\n\n- Initialize creatorBuffer with creator.startBuilding(...).\n- In the loop, assign creatorProps to creatorBuffer.\n- Do not build the bean inside the loop.\n- After the loop, build the bean with creatorBuffer.\n- Then process the tokens for regular properties.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nprotected Object deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped(JsonParser p,\n        DeserializationContext ctxt)\n        throws IOException, JsonProcessingException\n{\n    final PropertyBasedCreator creator = _propertyBasedCreator;\n    // Create a separate buffer for creator properties\n    PropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = creator.startBuilding(p, ctxt, _objectIdReader);\n\n    TokenBuffer tokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\n    tokens.writeStartObject();\n\n    JsonToken t = p.getCurrentToken();\n    for (; t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME; t = p.nextToken()) {\n        String propName = p.getCurrentName();\n        p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n        // creator property?\n        SettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\n        if (creatorProp != null) {\n            creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n            t = p.nextToken();\n            continue;\n        }\n        // Object Id property?\n        if (creatorBuffer.readIdProperty(propName)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // regular property? needs buffering\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = _beanProperties.find(propName);\n        if (prop != null) {\n            // Wait, but creatorBuffer is for creator properties, so regular properties should go elsewhere?\n            // Maybe the main buffer is for regular properties, but in this case, perhaps the token buffer handles them.\n            // So, perhaps we don't need to buffer regular properties here.\n            // Instead, they are written to the tokens and processed later.\n            tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n            tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (_ignorableProps != null && _ignorableProps.contains(propName)) {\n            handleIgnoredProperty(p, ctxt, handledType(), propName);\n            continue;\n        }\n        // \"any property\"?\n        if (_anySetter != null) {\n            // Not sure about this part, perhaps it's handled via tokens.\n            tokens.writeFieldName(propName);\n            tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n    Object bean;\n    try {\n        bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n    }\n    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n}\n\nWait, but in this approach, regular properties are not being buffered. Instead, they are written to the tokens and processed later by _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped().\n\nSo, perhaps the main buffer is not needed for regular properties because they are handled via the token buffer.\n\nSo, the fixed code removes the main buffer and uses creatorBuffer for creator properties, and",

We'll get copies but...\n[Issue Title]: Missing properties when deserializing using a builder class with a non-default constructor and a mutator annotated with @JsonUnwrapped\n[Issue Description]: When deserializing using a builder class with a non-default constructor and any number of mutator methods annotated with @JsonUnwrapped, the BuilderBasedDeserializer::deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped method cuts short the process of adding SettableBeanProperties.\nThe logic dictates that once all properties necessary to construct the builder have been found, the builder is constructed using all known SettableBeanProperties that have been found up to that point in the tokenizing process.\nTherefore, in the case that the builder has a single property required for construction, and that property is found anywhere other than at the end of the JSON content, any properties subsequent to the constructor property are not evaluated and are left with their default values.\nGiven the following classes:\n@JsonDeserialize(builder = Employee.Builder.class)\npublic class Employee {\n    private final long id;\n    private final Name name;\n    private final int age;\n\n    private Employee(Builder builder) {\n        id = builder.id;\n        name = builder.name;\n        age = builder.age;\n    }\n\n    public long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public Name getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    @JsonPOJOBuilder(withPrefix = \"set\")\n    public static class Builder {\n        private final long id;\n        private Name name;\n        private int age;\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        public Builder(@JsonProperty(\"emp_id\") long id) {\n            this.id = id;\n        }\n\n        @JsonUnwrapped\n        public void setName(Name name) {\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_age\")\n        public void setAge(int age) {\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n\n        public Employee build() {\n            return new Employee(this);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Name {\n    private final String first;\n    private final String last;\n\n    @JsonCreator\n    public Name(\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_first_name\") String first,\n        @JsonProperty(\"emp_last_name\") String last\n    ) {\n        this.first = first;\n        this.last = last;\n    }\n\n    public String getFirst() {\n        return first;\n    }\n\n    public String getLast() {\n        return last;\n    }\n}\nAnd given the following JSON string:\n{\n    \"emp_age\": 30,\n    \"emp_id\": 1234,\n    \"emp_first_name\": \"John\",\n    \"emp_last_name\": \"Doe\"\n}\nWe will see the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge()); // 30\nSystem.out.println(emp.getId()); // 1234\nSystem.out.println(emp.getName()); // null\nHowever, if we place the emp_id property at the end of the JSON string, we would get the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge()); // 30\nSystem.out.println(emp.getId()); // 1234\nSystem.out.println(emp.getName()); // Name Object\nIf we were to place emp_age and emp_first_name and emp_last_name all after the emp_id property in the JSON string, we would get the following output:\nEmployee emp = new ObjectMapper().readValue(json, Employee.class);\n\nSystem.out.println(emp.getAge());

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** The buggy code prematurely builds the bean object within the loop as soon as all creator properties are assigned. This is triggered by `buffer.assignParameter` returning true. After building the bean, it attempts to handle remaining tokens as unwrapped properties. This logic is flawed because it assumes that all regular properties and unwrapped properties will appear *after* the creator properties in the JSON input. If creator properties appear early in the JSON, subsequent regular or unwrapped properties are missed.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch removes the bean construction logic from within the loop. It only assigns the creator property to the buffer and continues processing the JSON input. The bean is constructed only after the entire JSON object has been parsed (after the loop). This ensures that all properties, including unwrapped ones, are processed and buffered before the bean is built.\n- **Generated Patch:** The generated patch also removes the bean construction logic from within the loop. It introduces a `continue` statement after assigning the creator property to the buffer, effectively skipping the bean construction and continuing to process the rest of the JSON input. Like the ground truth patch, the bean is built only after the loop.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** Both patches correct the core issue of premature bean construction.  Both patches ensure that all properties in the JSON are processed before the bean is built.  The generated patch uses a `continue` statement to skip the bean building block within the loop, while the ground truth patch simply removes the bean building block entirely from within the loop. Functionally, they achieve the same outcome.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input):** Both patches will correctly deserialize the JSON into the desired object, including unwrapped properties, even if creator properties appear early in the JSON.\n- **Missing/null values:** Both patches should handle missing or null values for properties in the same way as the intended Jackson behavior. The change is focused on the order of processing properties, not on how individual property values are handled.\n- **Out of bounds values:** Not directly applicable to this bug fix.\n- **Invalid inputs:** Both patches should maintain the existing error handling for invalid JSON inputs.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Buggy Code:** Includes a `try-catch` block within the loop to handle exceptions during bean construction. If an exception occurs, it attempts to wrap and throw it, and then `continue`s the loop. This error handling is misplaced because the bean should not be built inside the loop in the first place.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Removes the `try-catch` block from within the loop. Error handling for bean construction is moved to the end, after the loop, in a single `try-catch` block.\n- **Generated Patch:** Removes the `try-catch` block from within the loop, similar to the ground truth patch. Error handling for bean construction is also moved to the end, after the loop.\n- **Comparison:** Both patches simplify and correctly place the error handling for bean construction outside the loop, which is the correct location.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Will patch pass the trigger test?** Yes, both the ground truth and generated patches are designed to fix the issue highlighted by the trigger tests. By deferring bean construction, they ensure that all properties, including those after the creator properties in the JSON, are processed, thus resolving the failures in the trigger tests.\n- **Are there potential issues with other tests?** No, the patches are targeted at fixing a specific deserialization issue with property-based creators and unwrapped properties. The change is localized to the `deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped` method and should not negatively impact other deserialization scenarios. It is more likely to improve robustness in similar scenarios.\n- **Could behavior changes affect dependent code?** The behavioral change is a correction of a bug. Dependent code should rely on Jackson correctly deserializing objects, including unwrapped properties with builders. The patches make the behavior more correct and aligned with expected Jackson functionality.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Shows a moderate token similarity (0.41) and method signature similarity (0.67), but perfect variable usage similarity (1.00). The overall structure similarity is 0.60. This suggests structural differences, which are expected as the patches remove code from within the loop.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** High control flow similarity (0.95) indicates that the overall control flow remains largely similar, which is reasonable as the main loop structure is preserved.\n- **LLM-based validation:**  Strongly indicates semantic equivalence (1.0 confidence). The LLM correctly identifies that both patches achieve the same functional outcome of fixing the bug.\n- **Combined assessment:** The combined assessment concludes semantic equivalence with 0.70 confidence. While not perfect confidence, it leans towards equivalence, and considering the nature of the change (removing code block and moving error handling), the slight structural differences are understandable and do not negate semantic equivalence in terms of bug fix.\n\n[Classification]\nBased on the analysis, both the ground truth patch and the generated patch effectively address the bug by preventing premature bean construction within the loop. They ensure that all properties are processed before the bean is built, resolving the issue of missing properties when creator properties appear early in the JSON.  The generated patch achieves the same functional outcome as the ground truth patch, albeit with a slightly different code structure (using `continue` instead of simply removing the code block). The semantic equivalence testing, especially the LLM-based validation, supports the conclusion that the patches are semantically equivalent in terms of fixing the bug.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe core issue was premature bean construction in the loop. Both patches remove this premature construction, ensuring all properties are processed before building the bean.  Both patches will pass the trigger tests and are unlikely to negatively impact other functionalities.  While there are minor structural differences in how the patches are implemented, they are semantically equivalent in fixing the described bug. The generated patch correctly implements the necessary logic to resolve the issue.\n\n**Classification: CORRECT**",
