      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the findWrapPos function. The root cause is that when the start position plus the width equals the text length, the function tries to access an out-of-bounds index. Let me look at the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the function checks for newlines or tabs within the given width. If found, it returns pos + 1. That part seems okay.\n\nNext, there's an else if condition: if startPos + width is greater than or equal to text length, it returns -1. Wait, but if it's equal, that's exactly the problematic case. So, in that case, the function returns -1, which might not be correct because maybe we should handle it differently.\n\nLooking further, if the else if condition isn't met, the code proceeds to look for the last whitespace before startPos + width. It starts at pos = startPos + width and decrements until it finds a space, newline, or carriage return. But if pos is equal to text length, text.charAt(pos) will throw an exception because the last index is text.length() - 1.\n\nSo, the problem occurs when pos is exactly text.length(). I need to add a check to prevent accessing that index.\n\nThe suggestion is to handle the case where startPos + width equals text length. So, in that case, return startPos + width - 1 because that's the last valid index.\n\nLet me think about where to add this. Maybe right after the else if block. So, after checking if startPos + width >= text length, I can add an else if that checks if startPos + width == text length. Then, return startPos + width - 1.\n\nWait, but the existing else if returns -1 when startPos + width >= text length. So, perhaps I should adjust that condition. Maybe split it into two cases: if it's equal, handle it, else if it's greater, return -1.\n\nAlternatively, I can adjust the initial else if condition. Let me see.\n\nSo, the current else if is:\n\nelse if (startPos + width >= text.length()) {\n    return -1;\n}\n\nBut when startPos + width is exactly equal to text.length(), we shouldn't return -1. Instead, we should return text.length() - 1, but only if that position is a valid whitespace.\n\nWait, no. The problem is that when pos is set to startPos + width, which is equal to text.length(), and then in the while loop, it tries to get text.charAt(pos), which is out of bounds.\n\nSo, perhaps before the while loop, I should check if pos is beyond the text length.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. The function first checks for newlines or tabs. If found within width, returns pos +1.\n\n2. Then, if startPos + width >= text length, returns -1.\n\n3. Else, it sets pos to startPos + width.\n\n4. Then, it enters a while loop, checking from pos down to startPos for a whitespace.\n\nBut when pos is equal to text length, text.charAt(pos) will throw an exception.\n\nSo, perhaps before the while loop, I should add a condition: if pos >= text length, then handle it.\n\nWait, but in the else if, if startPos + width >= text length, it returns -1. So, the code after that else if is only executed when startPos + width < text length.\n\nWait, no. Because if startPos + width is equal to text length, the else if condition is true, so it returns -1. So, the code after that is only when startPos + width < text length.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the else if condition is >=, so when it's equal, it returns -1. But in that case, the code after the else if is not executed. So, perhaps the problem is elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the second part of the function where it increments pos beyond the text length.\n\nWait, let me think again. The bug occurs when startPos + width is equal to text length. So, in the else if condition, it returns -1, but perhaps that's not the correct behavior. Because maybe the function should still try to find a wrap position even if it's exactly at the end.\n\nWait, looking back at the original code, the else if condition returns -1 when startPos + width >= text length. But according to the root cause, when startPos + width equals text length, the function tries to access pos = text.length(), which is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps the else if condition is incorrect. Because when startPos + width is equal to text length, it's possible that the text ends exactly at that point, and we shouldn't return -1 but instead check if that's a valid position.\n\nWait, but in the else if, it returns -1, which skips the rest of the function. So, perhaps the problem is that when startPos + width is equal to text length, the function returns -1, but maybe it should instead allow the code to proceed to find a wrap position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the else if condition should be changed to only return -1 when startPos + width > text length, and handle the case when it's equal separately.\n\nSo, let me adjust the else if condition.\n\nChange from:\n\nelse if (startPos + width >= text.length())\n\nto:\n\nelse if (startPos + width > text.length())\n\nAnd then, add an else if for when startPos + width == text.length().\n\nIn that case, we can return startPos + width -1, but only if that position is a whitespace. Or perhaps, just return that position as the wrap point.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to find the wrap position, which is the position where the line should break. So, if the text ends exactly at startPos + width, perhaps the wrap position is at that point.\n\nBut the current code, when startPos + width is equal to text length, returns -1, which indicates no wrap position found. But that might not be correct because the text could end there, so the wrap could be at the end.\n\nSo, perhaps the else if condition should be modified.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check for newlines or tabs within the width. If found, return pos +1.\n\n2. Else, if startPos + width > text length: return -1.\n\n3. Else, if startPos + width == text length: check if the last character is a whitespace. If yes, return text length. Else, perhaps return -1 or find the last whitespace before.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to find the wrap position, which is the position after the last whitespace before the wrap point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when startPos + width is equal to text length, the function should treat it as a valid wrap position at text length, but only if the last character is a whitespace.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the original code's logic.\n\nThe function is trying to find a position to wrap the text. It first looks for a newline or tab within the width. If found, returns that position +1.\n\nIf not, it checks if the end of the wrap (startPos + width) is beyond the text length, returns -1.\n\nElse, it looks for the last whitespace before the wrap point.\n\nIf found, returns that position.\n\nIf not found, it then looks for the first whitespace after the wrap point.\n\nIf found, returns that position.\n\nElse, returns -1.\n\nSo, the problem is when the wrap point is exactly at the end of the text. In that case, the function returns -1, but perhaps it should return the end position if it's a valid wrap.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the else if, it proceeds to look for the last whitespace before the wrap point. But if the wrap point is at the end, then pos is set to text length, which is beyond the last index.\n\nSo, when the code does text.charAt(pos), it will throw an exception.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to handle the case where pos is equal to text length before accessing it.\n\nSo, perhaps before the while loop, we should check if pos is beyond the text length.\n\nWait, but in the else if condition, when startPos + width >= text length, it returns -1. So, the code after that is only when startPos + width < text length.\n\nWait, no. Because if startPos + width is equal to text length, the else if condition is true, so it returns -1, and the code after is not executed. So, perhaps the problem is not in that part.\n\nWait, perhaps the bug is in the second part of the function, where it increments pos beyond the text length.\n\nLooking at the code after the first while loop:\n\nIf no whitespace is found before the wrap point, the function sets pos to startPos + width again, and then enters another loop where it increments pos until it finds a whitespace or reaches beyond the text length.\n\nIn this loop, it checks if pos <= text length. So, when pos is equal to text length, it will access text.charAt(pos), which is out of bounds.\n\nSo, the condition in the while loop is pos <= text.length(), which is incorrect because the last valid index is text.length() -1.\n\nSo, the condition should be pos < text.length().\n\nSo, in the second while loop, change the condition from (pos <= text.length()) to (pos < text.length()).\n\nThat way, when pos is equal to text length, it won't enter the loop and won't access the invalid index.\n\nSo, the bug is in the second while loop's condition.\n\nSo, to fix it, I should change:\n\nwhile ((pos <= text.length()) && ... )\n\nto\n\nwhile ((pos < text.length()) && ... )\n\nThat way, when pos is equal to text length, the loop won't execute, preventing the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nSo, the steps to fix are:\n\n1. In the second while loop, change the condition from pos <= text.length() to pos < text.length().\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the else if condition should be adjusted to handle the case when startPos + width equals text length, but I'm not sure if that's necessary because the else if returns -1 in that case, which might be correct.\n\nWait, but if startPos + width is equal to text length, the function returns -1, which indicates no wrap position. But perhaps the correct behavior is to allow wrapping at the end of the text.\n\nHmm, perhaps the else if condition should be modified to return -1 only when startPos + width > text length, and when it's equal, proceed to find the wrap position.\n\nSo, let me adjust the else if condition.\n\nChange from:\n\nelse if (startPos + width >= text.length())\n\nto:\n\nelse if (startPos + width > text.length())\n\nThen, add an else if for when startPos + width == text.length().\n\nIn that case, we can check if the last character is a whitespace. If yes, return text.length(). Else, perhaps return -1 or find the last whitespace before.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return the position where the wrap occurs. So, if the wrap is exactly at the end, perhaps it's acceptable to return text.length().\n\nBut in the current code, when startPos + width is equal to text length, the else if condition returns -1, which skips the rest of the function.\n\nSo, perhaps the else if should be split into two cases:\n\nif (startPos + width > text.length()) {\n    return -1;\n} else if (startPos + width == text.length()) {\n    // handle this case\n}\n\nBut what should be done in the else if block?\n\nIn this case, the wrap position is exactly at the end of the text. So, perhaps the function should check if the last character is a whitespace. If yes, return the position (which is text.length()). Else, perhaps it should look for the last whitespace before.\n\nWait, but the code after the else if is designed to find the last whitespace before the wrap point. So, perhaps when startPos + width is equal to text length, we should allow the code to proceed to find the last whitespace before.\n\nSo, perhaps the else if condition should only return -1 when startPos + width > text.length(), and when it's equal, proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Change the else if condition to check for > instead of >=.\n\n- Then, when startPos + width == text.length(), the code proceeds to the part where it looks for the last whitespace before.\n\nBut in that case, when pos is set to startPos + width, which is text.length(), the while loop will try to access text.charAt(pos), which is invalid.\n\nSo, to prevent that, in the first while loop, we need to ensure that pos does not exceed text.length() -1.\n\nSo, perhaps in the first while loop, the condition should be pos >= startPos and pos < text.length().\n\nWait, the first while loop is:\n\nwhile ((pos >= startPos) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ') && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r')) {\n    --pos;\n}\n\nSo, if pos is equal to text.length(), which is beyond the last index, it will throw an exception.\n\nSo, to fix this, in the first while loop, we need to add a condition that pos is less than text.length().\n\nSo, modify the condition to:\n\n(pos >= startPos) && (pos < text.length()) && (c != ' ') && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r')\n\nWait, but that would change the order of conditions. So, perhaps reorganize the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, before the loop, check if pos is beyond the text length.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assignment of pos should be the minimum of startPos + width and text.length() -1.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, in the first while loop, add a condition to break if pos is beyond the text length.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to adjust the while loop condition to include pos < text.length().\n\nSo, in the first while loop, change the condition to:\n\nwhile (pos >= startPos && pos < text.length() && (c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ' && c != '\\n' && c != '\\r')\n\nThis way, if pos is equal to text.length(), the loop won't execute, preventing the exception.\n\nSimilarly, in the second while loop, the condition is pos <= text.length(), which should be changed to pos < text.length().\n\nSo, to summarize, the two changes needed are:\n\n1. In the first while loop, add pos < text.length() to the condition.\n\n2. In the second while loop, change the condition from pos <= text.length() to pos < text.length().\n\nAdditionally, perhaps adjust the else if condition to handle the case when startPos + width equals text length.\n\nWait, but if we adjust the else if condition to return -1 only when startPos + width > text length, then when it's equal, the code proceeds to the while loops, which now have the corrected conditions.\n\nSo, let me outline the changes:\n\n- Change the else if condition from >= to >.\n\n- In the first while loop, add pos < text.length() to the condition.\n\n- In the second while loop, change pos <= text.length() to pos < text.length().\n\nLet me test this logic.\n\nSuppose text length is 10, startPos is 5, width is 5. So, startPos + width = 10, which equals text length.\n\nThe else if condition (startPos + width > text.length()) is false, so the code proceeds.\n\npos is set to 10.\n\nIn the first while loop, the condition is pos >= startPos (10 >=5) and pos < text.length() (10 <10 is false). So, the loop doesn't execute.\n\nThen, the code checks if pos > startPos (10>5 is true), so returns pos, which is 10. But wait, text length is 10, so the last index is 9. So, returning 10 would be beyond the text length.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the function is supposed to return a position within the text.\n\nSo, perhaps in the case where pos is equal to text length, we should not return it unless it's a valid position.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the first while loop, it checks if pos > startPos. So, in this case, pos is 10, which is >5, so it returns 10. But that's beyond the text length.\n\nSo, that's another bug.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function should not return a position equal to text length because that's beyond the last index.\n\nSo, perhaps after the first while loop, we should check if pos is within the text length.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should return pos only if it's less than text length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should return pos only if it's a valid index.\n\nSo, perhaps in the first part, after the while loop, we should check if pos is within the text.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be adjusted as follows:\n\nAfter the first while loop, if pos is greater than startPos and pos is less than text length, return pos.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (pos > startPos && pos < text.length()) {\n    return pos;\n}\n\nBut wait, the code currently returns pos if it's greater than startPos, regardless of whether it's beyond the text length.\n\nSo, that's another issue.\n\nSo, perhaps in addition to the previous changes, we need to adjust the condition after the first while loop.\n\nSo, to fix all issues:\n\n1. Change the else if condition to return -1 only when startPos + width > text length.\n\n2. In the first while loop, add pos < text.length() to the condition.\n\n3. After the first while loop, check if pos is greater than startPos and less than text length before returning.\n\n4. In the second while loop, change the condition to pos < text.length().\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo, the modified code would look like:\n\nprotected int findWrapPos(String text, int width, int startPos) {\n    int pos;\n\n    if (((pos = text.indexOf('\\n', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width) ||\n        ((pos = text.indexOf('\\t', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width)) {\n        return pos + 1;\n    } else if (startPos + width > text.length()) {\n        return -1;\n    } else if (startPos + width == text.length()) {\n        // Handle the case where wrap is exactly at the end\n        // Check if the last character is a whitespace\n        char lastChar = text.charAt(text.length() - 1);\n        if (lastChar == ' ' || lastChar == '\\n' || lastChar == '\\r') {\n            return text.length();\n        } else {\n            // Look for the last whitespace before\n            pos = text.length() - 1;\n            while (pos >= startPos && (text.charAt(pos) != ' ' && text.charAt(pos) != '\\n' && text.charAt(pos) != '\\r')) {\n                --pos;\n            }\n            if (pos > startPos) {\n                return pos + 1;\n            } else {\n                return -1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    pos = startPos + width;\n\n    char c;\n    while (pos >= startPos && pos < text.length() && (c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ' && c != '\\n' && c != '\\r') {\n        --pos;\n    }\n\n    if (pos > startPos && pos < text.length()) {\n        return pos;\n    }\n\n    pos = startPos + width;\n    while (pos < text.length() && (c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ' && c != '\\n' && c != '\\r') {\n        ++pos;\n    }\n\n    return pos == text.length() ? -1 : pos;\n}\n\nWait, but this adds a lot of changes. Maybe it's better to handle the case where startPos + width equals text length within the existing code by adjusting the else if condition and the while loop conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of changing the else if condition and the while loop conditions is sufficient.\n\nLet me try to make minimal changes.\n\nChange the else if condition from >= to >.\n\nIn the first while loop, add pos < text.length().\n\nIn the second while loop, change <= to <.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nprotected int findWrapPos(String text, int width, int startPos) {\n    int pos;\n\n    if (((pos = text.indexOf('\\n', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width)\n            || ((pos = text.indexOf('\\t', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width)) {\n        return pos + 1;\n    } else if (startPos + width > text.length()) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    pos = startPos + width;\n\n    char c;\n\n    while ((pos >= startPos) && (pos < text.length()) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ')\n            && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r')) {\n        --pos;\n    }\n\n    if (pos > startPos) {\n        return pos;\n    }\n\n    pos = startPos + width;\n    while ((pos < text.length()) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ')\n           && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r')) {\n        ++pos;\n    }        \n    return pos == text.length() ? -1 : pos;\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, when startPos + width equals text length, the else if condition is false, so the code proceeds.\n\npos is set to text length.\n\nIn the first while loop, pos >= startPos is true, but pos < text.length() is false, so the loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, it checks if pos > startPos, which is true (since text length is > startPos), so returns pos, which is text length.\n\nBut that's beyond the last index, which is text length -1.\n\nSo, this would cause the function to return a position that's beyond the text, which is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should not return pos if it's equal to text length.\n\nSo, in the condition after the first while loop, we should check if pos is less than text length.\n\nSo, change:\n\nif (pos > startPos) {\n\nto\n\nif (pos > startPos && pos < text.length()) {\n\nThat way, if pos is equal to text length, it won't return it.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nprotected int findWrapPos(String text, int width, int startPos) {\n    int pos;\n\n    if (((pos = text.indexOf('\\n', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width)\n            || ((pos = text.indexOf('\\t', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width)) {\n        return pos + 1;\n    } else if (startPos + width > text.length()) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    pos = startPos + width;\n\n    char c;\n\n    while ((pos >= startPos) && (pos < text.length()) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ')\n            && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r')) {\n        --pos;\n    }\n\n    if (pos > startPos && pos < text.length()) {\n        return pos;\n    }\n\n    pos = startPos + width;\n    while ((pos < text.length()) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ')\n           && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r')) {\n        ++pos;\n    }        \n    return pos == text.length() ? -1 : pos;\n}\n\nNow, when startPos + width equals text length, the else if condition is false, so code proceeds.\n\npos is set to text length.\n\nIn the first while loop, pos >= startPos is true, but pos < text.length() is false, so loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, the condition after the loop is pos > startPos (true) and pos < text.length() (false), so it doesn't return.\n\nThen, the code proceeds to the second part, setting pos to text length again.\n\nIn the second while loop, pos < text.length() is false, so loop doesn't run.\n\nThen, returns pos == text.length() ? -1 : pos.\n\nWhich is -1.\n\nSo, in this case, the function returns -1 when the wrap position is exactly at the end.\n\nBut according to the root cause, this is the case where the function should return the correct position without throwing an exception.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should return text.length",
      "protected int findWrapPos(String text, int width, int startPos)\n{\n    int pos;\n    \n    // the line ends before the max wrap pos or a new line char found\n    if (((pos = text.indexOf('\\n', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width)\n            || ((pos = text.indexOf('\\t', startPos)) != -1 && pos <= width))\n    {\n        return pos + 1;\n    }\n    else if (startPos + width >= text.length())\n    {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n\n    // look for the last whitespace character before startPos+width\n    pos = startPos + width;\n\n    char c;\n\n    while ((pos >= startPos) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ')\n            && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r'))\n    {\n        --pos;\n    }\n\n    // if we found it - just return\n    if (pos > startPos)\n    {\n        return pos;\n    }\n    \n    // if we didn't find one, simply chop at startPos+width\n    pos = startPos + width;\n    while ((pos < text.length()) && ((c = text.charAt(pos)) != ' ')\n           && (c != '\\n') && (c != '\\r'))\n    {\n        ++pos;\n    }        \n    return pos == text.length() ? -1 : pos;\n}"
