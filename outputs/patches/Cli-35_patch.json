Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function getMatchingOptions is returning all options that start with the specified partial name, without considering whether the match is exact or not. This is causing the parser to throw an AmbiguousOptionException when it encounters multiple options that match the partial name.\nSuggestion: Exact Match Only\nModify the function to return only the options that exactly match the specified partial name. This can be done by checking if the length of the long option is equal to the length of the partial name, in addition to checking if it starts with the partial name. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic List<String> getMatchingOptions(String opt)\n{\n    opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(opt);\n    \n    List<String> matchingOpts = new ArrayList<String>();\n\n    for (String longOpt : longOpts.keySet())\n    {\n        if (longOpt.equals(opt))\n        {\n            matchingOpts.add(longOpt);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return matchingOpts;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic List<String> getMatchingOptions(String opt)\n{\n    opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(opt);\n    \n    List<String> matchingOpts = new ArrayList<String>();\n\n    // for a perfect match return the single option only\n\n    for (String longOpt : longOpts.keySet())\n    {\n        if (longOpt.startsWith(opt))\n        {\n            matchingOpts.add(longOpt);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return matchingOpts;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the parser to throw an AmbiguousOptionException when it encounters multiple options that match the partial name.\nSuggestion: Return Single Exact Match\nModify the function to return only the first option that exactly matches the specified partial name.
