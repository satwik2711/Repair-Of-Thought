      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The _deserializeFromEmptyString method is not correctly handling the case for Locale when an empty string is passed. The method is currently calling super._deserializeFromEmptyString() for Locale, which is returning null instead of Locale.ROOT.\nSuggestion: Return Locale.ROOT for empty string\nReturn Locale.ROOT directly when the input is an empty string, instead of calling super._deserializeFromEmptyString(). This is the simplest fix and aligns with the expected behavior. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprotected Object _deserializeFromEmptyString() throws IOException {\n    if (_kind == STD_URI) {\n        return URI.create(\"\");\n    } else if (_kind == Locale.class) {\n        return Locale.ROOT;\n    }\n    return super._deserializeFromEmptyString();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected Object _deserializeFromEmptyString() throws IOException {\n    // As per [databind#398], URI requires special handling\n    if (_kind == STD_URI) {\n        return URI.create(\"\");\n    }\n    // As per [databind#1123], Locale too\n    return super._deserializeFromEmptyString();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The method is currently calling super._deserializeFromEmptyString() for Locale, which is returning null instead of Locale.ROOT.\nSuggestion: Override _deserializeFromEmptyString in LocaleDeserializer\nCreate a custom LocaleDeserializer that overrides the _deserializeFromEmptyString method to return Locale.ROOT for empty strings. This approach is more flexible and allows for further customization if needed.

The method is currently calling super._deserializeFromEmptyString() for Locale, which is returning null instead of Locale.ROOT.\nSuggestion: Add a special case for Locale in _deserializeFromEmptyString\nAdd a special case in the _deserializeFromEmptyString method to check if the type is Locale and return Locale.ROOT if the input is an empty string.
