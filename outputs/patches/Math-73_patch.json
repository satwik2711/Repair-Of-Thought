      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the solve method. The problem is that the method isn't correctly handling cases where the initial guess is outside the interval defined by min and max. Right now, it only checks if initial is between min and max, but that's not enough because the interval could be, for example, min=5, max=10, and initial=3, which is outside. So, the initial guess should be within the [min, max] interval.\n\nThe suggestion is to add a new method called verifyInitialGuess which checks if initial is within min and max. Then, call this method at the beginning of solve.\n\nLooking at the current code, the first thing it does is clearResult() and then verifySequence(min, initial, max). Wait, what does verifySequence do? Oh right, it probably checks that min <= initial <= max. So that's already ensuring that initial is within the interval. But wait, maybe the issue is that the initial could be outside the interval, but the current verifySequence is not handling it correctly? Or perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the min and max, but not necessarily within the interval as defined by the endpoints.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the initial guess is not checked against the interval defined by the two endpoints. So, for example, if min is 1, max is 3, and initial is 5, which is outside. The current code's verifySequence might not catch this because it's only checking min <= initial <= max, but if initial is outside, it's a problem.\n\nWait, no, if initial is 5, and min is 1, max is 3, then initial is greater than max. So verifySequence would throw an exception because it's expecting min <= initial <= max. So why is the problem occurring?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial guess is within the min and max, but the function is not checking if it's within the correct bracketing. Or maybe the initial guess is not between min and max, but the code isn't handling that correctly.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the initial guess is not checked against the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial guess is allowed to be outside the interval, but the code is not handling that case, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the first line after clearResult is verifySequence(min, initial, max). So that should ensure that initial is between min and max. So why is the problem happening?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the initial guess is within the min and max, but the function is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not between the two endpoints in terms of function values. Or maybe the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly checking if it's a valid starting point.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the initial guess is not within the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial is outside the [min, max] range, and the current code isn't checking for that, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nWait, but the current code calls verifySequence, which I think checks that min <= initial <= max. So if initial is outside, it should throw an exception. So maybe the problem is that the initial is within min and max, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not between the two endpoints in terms of function values.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code proceeds without ensuring that the initial is a valid starting point for the Brent algorithm. So, for example, if the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and initial don't bracket a root, the code might not handle it correctly.\n\nWait, looking at the code, after verifying the sequence, it computes yInitial. If yInitial is within functionValueAccuracy, it returns initial. Then it checks yMin, and if that's good, returns min. Then it checks if yInitial * yMin < 0, which would mean they bracket a root. If so, it calls solve with min, yMin, initial, yInitial.\n\nSimilarly, it checks yMax, and if yInitial * yMax < 0, it proceeds.\n\nOtherwise, it calls the full Brent algorithm.\n\nSo the problem arises when the initial guess is not within the interval, but the code doesn't check that. Wait, but verifySequence should have already checked that initial is between min and max. So why is the initial guess outside the interval?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within min and max, but the function is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not between the two endpoints in terms of the function's behavior. Or perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling the case where the initial is not a valid starting point for the algorithm.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the initial guess is not within the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial is outside the [min, max] range, and the code is not checking for that. But the code does call verifySequence, which should check that initial is between min and max. So maybe the problem is that the initial is within min and max, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling the case where the initial is not a valid bracketing point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly checking whether the initial is a valid starting point for the Brent algorithm. For example, if the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and initial do not bracket a root, and similarly for initial and max, then the code proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, which might not handle that correctly.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the issue is that the initial guess is not within the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial is outside the [min, max] range, and the code is not checking for that.\n\nWait, but the code calls verifySequence, which should ensure that min <= initial <= max. So if initial is outside, it should throw an exception. So why is the problem occurring?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within min and max, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point. For example, if the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and initial are both positive or both negative, and similarly for initial and max, then the code proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, which may not be handling that correctly.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the problem is that the initial guess is not within the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial is outside the interval, and the code is not checking for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the verifySequence method is not correctly checking the order. Let me think: verifySequence(a, b, c) probably checks that a <= b <= c. So if min is 1, initial is 3, max is 2, then verifySequence would throw because 1 <=3 is true, but 3 <=2 is false. So initial can't be outside the interval if verifySequence is called.\n\nWait, but what if min is 5, max is 10, and initial is 3? Then verifySequence would check 5 <=3, which is false, so it would throw. So initial can't be outside the interval.\n\nSo why is the problem occurring? The root cause says that the initial guess is not within the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling the case where the initial is not a valid starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid bracketing point. For example, if the initial is within [min, max], but f(initial) is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to incorrect root-finding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly checking if the initial is a valid starting point before proceeding.\n\nWait, looking back at the code, after verifySequence, it computes yInitial. If yInitial is good enough, returns initial. Then computes yMin, returns min if good. Then checks if yInitial * yMin <0, which would mean min and initial bracket a root. If so, proceeds with solve.\n\nSimilarly for yMax. If neither bracket, then proceeds to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling the case where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the problem is that the initial guess is not within the interval, and the code isn't checking for that. So perhaps the initial is outside the interval, but the code isn't catching it because verifySequence isn't correctly checking.\n\nWait, perhaps the verifySequence is not correctly checking the initial. Let me think: what does verifySequence do? It's a method that probably checks that the three values are in order. So if min is 1, initial is 3, max is 2, then verifySequence would throw because 3 >2. So initial can't be outside the interval.\n\nSo why is the problem occurring? Maybe the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly checking whether the initial is a valid starting point for the Brent algorithm, leading to incorrect root-finding.\n\nBut the root cause says that the initial is not within the interval, so perhaps the initial is outside, but the code isn't checking for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, such as when the function values at min and initial don't bracket a root, and similarly for initial and max.\n\nBut the code does handle that by proceeding to the full Brent algorithm. So perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly checking if the initial is a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling the case where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to the function not converging or throwing an exception.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the problem is that the initial is not within the interval, so the code isn't checking for that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect root-finding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly checking if the initial is a valid starting point before proceeding, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The root cause says that the initial guess is not within the interval, so the code isn't checking for that. So perhaps the initial is outside the interval, but the code isn't catching it.\n\nWait, but the code calls verifySequence, which should check that initial is between min and max. So if initial is outside, verifySequence should throw an exception.\n\nSo why is the problem occurring? Maybe the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid bracketing point.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to the function not finding the root correctly.\n\nBut the root cause says that the initial is not within the interval, so perhaps the initial is outside, and the code isn't checking for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe root cause says that the solve method is not correctly handling non-bracketing intervals because it's not checking if the initial guess is within the interval defined by the two endpoints. It's only checking if the initial is between min and max, but not considering if it's outside the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect root-finding.\n\nBut the root cause says that the initial is not within the interval, so the code isn't checking for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to the function not finding the root correctly.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The root cause says that the initial is not within the interval, so the code isn't checking for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the problem is that the initial is not within the interval, so the code isn't checking for that.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial is outside the interval, and the code isn't catching it because verifySequence isn't correctly checking.\n\nWait, but verifySequence is called with min, initial, max. So if initial is outside, it should throw.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nBut the root cause says that the initial is not within the interval, so the code isn't checking for that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the code is not correctly handling cases where the initial is not a valid starting point, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the solve method. The problem is that it doesn't correctly handle cases where the initial guess is outside the interval defined by min and max. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, looking at the original code. The method starts by calling verifySequence(min, initial, max). I remember that verifySequence checks if min <= initial <= max. So that's already ensuring the initial is within the min and max in terms of order. But wait, the root cause says that the initial guess might not be within the interval defined by the endpoints. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the initial code only verifies the sequence, which ensures min <= initial <= max. But what if the initial is not between min and max in value? Like, if min is 1, max is 2, and initial is 0, then verifySequence would throw an error. So maybe the problem is different.\n\nWait, the root cause says the initial guess is not within the interval defined by the two endpoints. So perhaps the initial is between min and max in terms of order, but not in terms of the function values. Or maybe the initial is outside the interval in terms of value, but the verifySequence allows it because it's just checking the order.\n\nWait, no. The verifySequence method probably checks that min <= initial <= max. So if initial is outside that range, it would throw an exception. So why is the initial not within the interval? Maybe the function is expecting the initial to be between min and max, but the current code doesn't check if initial is actually within the [min, max] interval in terms of value.\n\nWait, no. Because if min is 5, max is 10, and initial is 3, then verifySequence would throw because 3 is less than min. So the initial is guaranteed to be between min and max in terms of value. So why is the problem occurring?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is when the initial is within min and max, but the function values don't bracket a root. So when the initial is between min and max, but the function at initial and at min have the same sign, and same with max. So the method proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, but perhaps it's not handling cases where the initial is not within the interval correctly.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the solve method is not correctly handling non-bracketing intervals because it's not checking if the initial guess is within the interval. So perhaps the initial is not between min and max, but the verifySequence allows it because it's just checking the order, not the actual value.\n\nWait, no. Because if min is 1, max is 2, and initial is 3, then verifySequence would check if min <= initial <= max, which is false, so it would throw an exception. So the initial is always within the interval [min, max] in terms of value.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but when the function is evaluated, it's not within the interval in terms of the function's behavior. Like, the function might have a discontinuity or something. But that's a different issue.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the root cause. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe root cause says: The solve method is not correctly handling non-bracketing intervals because it's not checking if the initial guess is within the interval defined by the two endpoints. It's only checking if the initial is between min and max, but not considering when it's outside the interval.\n\nWait, but the verifySequence method is called, which ensures min <= initial <= max. So the initial is within the interval. So perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and max don't bracket a root, and the initial's function value also doesn't help. So the method proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, which might not handle this correctly.\n\nWait, but the original code does handle the cases where min and initial bracket, or initial and max bracket. If neither does, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm. So what's the bug?\n\nThe suggestion is to add a check to see if the initial is within the interval defined by the two endpoints. If not, throw an exception. But wait, the initial is already checked by verifySequence, which ensures it's between min and max. So perhaps the problem is that the initial is between min and max, but the function's value at initial is not within the function's range at the endpoints.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and max don't bracket a root, and the initial's function value is such that it's not helping. So the method might get stuck or not find a root.\n\nBut the user's suggestion is to add a check that the initial is within the interval. But since verifySequence already ensures that, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function at initial is not within the function's range, leading to non-bracketing.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and max are both positive or both negative, and the initial's function value is also the same sign, so there's no bracketing. In that case, the method should throw an exception because it can't proceed.\n\nBut in the original code, after checking if the initial is good enough, it checks if min and initial bracket the root. If not, it checks if initial and max bracket. If neither, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nWait, but the full Brent algorithm might require that the initial is within the interval. So perhaps the problem is that when the initial is outside the interval, but the verifySequence allows it because it's in order, but the function can't proceed.\n\nWait, no. Because verifySequence ensures that min <= initial <= max, so initial is within the interval. So perhaps the problem is that the initial is within the interval, but the function values don't bracket a root, and the method doesn't handle that correctly.\n\nWait, but the original code does handle that by proceeding to the full Brent algorithm. So why is the bug occurring?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial is not within the interval [min, max], but the verifySequence is not correctly checking. For example, if min is 5, max is 10, and initial is 3, then verifySequence would throw because 3 < 5. So the initial is always within [min, max].\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max). So the initial is in the interval, but the function value is outside the range of the function at the endpoints. So the method might not handle that correctly.\n\nBut the original code seems to handle that by checking if min and initial bracket, then initial and max bracket. If neither, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function at initial is not a root, and neither min nor max is a root, and the function doesn't cross zero in the interval, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect result.\n\nBut the original code would proceed to the full Brent algorithm, which should handle that by expanding the interval or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the initial is not within the interval [min, max], but the verifySequence allows it because it's just checking the order. For example, if min is 1, initial is 2, max is 3: that's fine. But if min is 3, initial is 2, max is 1, then verifySequence would throw because 3 <= 2 is false. So initial is always between min and max.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and max are the same sign, and the initial's function value is also the same sign, so there's no root in the interval. The method should throw an exception in that case, but it's proceeding to the full Brent algorithm, which might not handle it correctly.\n\nBut in the original code, after checking min and initial, and initial and max, if neither bracket, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm. So perhaps in that case, the method should throw an exception because there's no root in the interval.\n\nWait, but the Brent algorithm can sometimes find a root even if the initial guess is not bracketing, by expanding the interval. So maybe the problem is that the initial is not within the interval, but the code allows it because verifySequence only checks the order, not the actual value.\n\nWait, no. Because verifySequence ensures that min <= initial <= max, so initial is within the interval.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the suggested fix. The suggestion is to add a check after verifySequence to see if initial is within [min, max]. If not, throw an exception.\n\nBut wait, verifySequence already ensures that min <= initial <= max. So adding that check again is redundant. Unless the verifySequence is not correctly implemented.\n\nWait, perhaps the verifySequence method is not correctly checking the order. For example, if min is 5, max is 10, and initial is 3, then verifySequence should throw. But if it's not doing that, then the initial could be outside the interval.\n\nBut in the original code, the verifySequence is called, so perhaps the initial is guaranteed to be within [min, max]. So why is the initial not within the interval?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between the function's values at min and max. So the initial is within the interval, but the function value is outside, leading to no root.\n\nBut the original code handles that by checking if min and initial bracket, then initial and max bracket. If neither, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function values at min and max are both positive or both negative, and the initial's function value is also the same sign, so no root is present. The method should throw an exception in this case, but instead, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, which might not find a root and exceed max iterations.\n\nSo the fix is to add a check after the initial function value is computed. If the initial is not within the interval defined by the function values at min and max, then throw an exception.\n\nWait, no. Because the function could have multiple roots, and the initial could be in a region where the function crosses zero elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between the function's values at min and max, leading to the method not correctly handling the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), so the initial is not in the interval defined by the function's endpoints. So the method should check if the initial's function value is between f(min) and f(max), and if not, throw an exception.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the function could have varying behavior. For example, f(min) could be 1, f(initial) could be -1, and f(max) could be 1 again. So the initial's function value is not between f(min) and f(max), but it's still a valid point within the interval.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the suggested fix. The suggestion is to add a check after verifySequence to see if initial is within [min, max]. If not, throw an exception.\n\nBut since verifySequence already ensures that, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not handling it correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is outside the range of f(min) and f(max). So when the method tries to bracket, it can't because the initial's function value is beyond one of the endpoints.\n\nSo, for example, f(min) is 1, f(initial) is 5, f(max) is 3. So initial is within [min, max], but f(initial) is higher than both f(min) and f(max). So the method might not handle this correctly.\n\nIn that case, the method should check if the initial's function value is within the range of f(min) and f(max). If not, perhaps it's an error.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the Brent algorithm. The Brent algorithm typically requires that the initial guess is within a bracketing interval. So if the initial is within [min, max], but the function values don't bracket a root, then the algorithm might not converge.\n\nSo perhaps the fix is to ensure that the initial is within the interval [min, max], and that the function values at min and max bracket a root, or that the initial's function value brackets with one of them.\n\nWait, but the original code already checks if min and initial bracket, or initial and max bracket. If neither, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that when neither min and initial nor initial and max bracket a root, the method proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, which may not handle the case where the initial is outside the function's range.\n\nWait, but the initial is within [min, max], so perhaps the full Brent algorithm can still find a root if one exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not correctly handling the case.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me look at the suggested fix again. The suggestion is to add a check after verifySequence to see if initial is within [min, max]. If not, throw an exception.\n\nBut since verifySequence already ensures that, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value is not within the function's range at the endpoints.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max). So the method should check if yInitial is between yMin and yMax, and if not, throw an exception.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the function could have multiple crossings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not within the interval defined by the function's values at min and max, leading to the method not correctly handling the case.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the code again.\n\nIn the original code, after computing yInitial, it checks if it's a root. Then it checks yMin, then yMax. Then it checks if yInitial and yMin have opposite signs, which would mean min and initial bracket a root. Similarly for initial and max.\n\nIf neither bracket, it proceeds to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nSo the problem arises when the initial is within [min, max], but neither min and initial nor initial and max bracket a root. In that case, the method proceeds to the full Brent algorithm, which may not handle it correctly.\n\nSo perhaps the fix is to ensure that the initial is within the interval [min, max], and that either min and initial or initial and max bracket a root. If not, throw an exception.\n\nBut the original code doesn't do that. It proceeds to the full Brent algorithm regardless.\n\nSo the suggested fix is to add a check after verifySequence to ensure that the initial is within [min, max]. But that's already done by verifySequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not correctly handling the case.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the code again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), causing the method to not find a root when it should.\n\nBut the Brent algorithm is designed to handle such cases by expanding the interval.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of a test case where the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is outside the range of f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not finding a root.\n\nFor example, let's say min=1, max=3, initial=2. f(1)=1, f(2)=5, f(3)=3. So f(2) is higher than both f(1) and f(3). So the function has a maximum at initial. So there's no root in [1,3] if the function is always positive.\n\nIn this case, the method would compute yInitial=5, which is not a root. Then yMin=1, not a root. Then check if yInitial * yMin <0, which is 5*1=5>0, so no. Then compute yMax=3, not a root. Check if yInitial * yMax <0: 5*3=15>0, so no. Then proceed to the full Brent algorithm.\n\nBut since there's no root in [1,3], the method would eventually throw a MaxIterationsExceededException.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value is outside the range, leading to the method not handling it correctly.\n\nBut in this case, the method would proceed as normal and eventually fail.\n\nSo why is the initial not within the interval? Because the initial is within [min, max], so the problem must be elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not correctly handling the bracketing.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the suggested fix again.\n\nThe suggestion is to add a check after verifySequence to see if initial is within [min, max]. If not, throw an exception. But since verifySequence already ensures that, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not correctly handling the case.\n\nSo perhaps the fix is to add a check that yInitial is between yMin and yMax.

If not, throw an exception.\n\nBut that might not be correct. For example, if f(min) is 1, f(initial) is 5, f(max) is 3. The function could have a root between initial and max, even though f(initial) is higher than f(max).\n\nSo throwing an exception in that case would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the initial is within [min, max], but the function's value at initial is not between f(min) and f(max), leading to the method not correctly handling the case.\n\nBut I'm not sure.
