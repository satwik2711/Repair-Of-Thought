      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `OpenMapRealMatrix` function does not validate the column dimension before creating the matrix. When the column dimension is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it exceeds the maximum allowed value, causing the `AssertionFailedError`. The function should throw a `NumberIsTooLargeException` when the column dimension is too large.\nSuggestion: Validate Column Dimension\nCheck if the column dimension exceeds the maximum allowed value and throw a `NumberIsTooLargeException` if necessary. This solution is straightforward and efficient, but it may not handle all possible edge cases.\n\n```java\npublic OpenMapRealMatrix(int rowDimension, int columnDimension) {\n    if (columnDimension > Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1) {\n        throw new NumberIsTooLargeException(Integer.MAX_VALUE, columnDimension, false);\n    }\n    super(rowDimension, columnDimension);\n    this.rows = rowDimension;\n    this.columns = columnDimension;\n    this.entries = new OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(0.0);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic OpenMapRealMatrix(int rowDimension, int columnDimension) {\n    super(rowDimension, columnDimension);\n    this.rows = rowDimension;\n    this.columns = columnDimension;\n    this.entries = new OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(0.0);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

When the column dimension is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it exceeds the maximum allowed value, causing the `AssertionFailedError`. The function should throw a `NumberIsTooLargeException` when the column dimension is too large.\nSuggestion: Use a Larger Data Type\nConsider using a larger data type, such as `long`, to represent the column dimension. This would allow for larger matrices, but may also introduce new issues, such as increased memory usage or potential overflow errors.\n\n```java\npublic OpenMapRealMatrix(int rowDimension, long columnDimension) {\n    super(rowDimension, (int) columnDimension);\n    this.rows = rowDimension;\n    this.columns = (int) columnDimension;\n    this.entries = new OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(0.0);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic OpenMapRealMatrix(int rowDimension, int columnDimension) {\n    super(rowDimension, columnDimension);\n    this.rows = rowDimension;\n    this.columns = columnDimension;\n    this.entries = new OpenIntToDoubleHashMap(0.0);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
