      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `createInstance` method does not check if the subclass overrides the necessary methods before creating a new instance. This allows an invalid subclass to be used, leading to unexpected behavior.\nSuggestion: Check for Override using Reflection\nCheck if the subclass overrides the necessary methods using Java reflection. This can be done by getting the methods of the subclass and checking if they override the methods of the superclass. The `createInstance` method can be modified to use reflection to check for the override, and throw an `IllegalStateException` if the subclass does not override the necessary methods.\n// Buggy Function\npublic DefaultPrettyPrinter createInstance() {\n    return new DefaultPrettyPrinter(this);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This allows an invalid subclass to be used, leading to unexpected behavior.\nSuggestion: Use a Template Method\nModify the `createInstance` method to use a template method that checks if the subclass overrides the necessary methods. This can be done by adding an abstract method to the superclass that must be implemented by the subclass. The `createInstance` method can then call this abstract method to check if the subclass has overridden the necessary methods.\n// Buggy Function\npublic DefaultPrettyPrinter createInstance() {\n    return new DefaultPrettyPrinter(this);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
