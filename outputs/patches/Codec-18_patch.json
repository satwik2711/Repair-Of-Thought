      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is in the line where the function calls CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches. The function is passing the maximum length of the two CharSequences as the length parameter, which can cause the function to try to access an index that is out of range of the shorter CharSequence. This is because the regionMatches function does not handle the case where the two CharSequences have different lengths.\nSuggestion: Use Minimum Length\nInstead of passing the maximum length of the two CharSequences, we can pass the minimum length. This will ensure that the function does not try to access an index that is out of range of the shorter CharSequence. We can modify the line to: return CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches(cs1, false, 0, cs2, 0, Math.min(cs1.length(), cs2.length()));\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean equals(final CharSequence cs1, final CharSequence cs2) {\n    if (cs1 == cs2) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (cs1 == null || cs2 == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    if (cs1 instanceof String && cs2 instanceof String) {\n        return cs1.equals(cs2);\n    }\n    return CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches(cs1, false, 0, cs2, 0, Math.max(cs1.length(), cs2.length()));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the regionMatches function does not handle the case where the two CharSequences have different lengths.\nSuggestion: Check Length Before Calling regionMatches\nAnother approach is to check the length of the two CharSequences before calling the regionMatches function. If the lengths are different, we can immediately return false.

This is because the regionMatches function does not handle the case where the two CharSequences have different lengths.\nSuggestion: Use a Loop to Compare Characters\nInstead of using the regionMatches function, we can use a loop to compare the characters of the two CharSequences. This will give us more control over the comparison and allow us to handle the case where the two CharSequences have different lengths. We can modify the function to: for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(cs1.length(), cs2.length()); i++) { if (cs1.charAt(i) != cs2.charAt(i)) { return false; } } return cs1.length() == cs2.length();\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean equals(final CharSequence cs1, final CharSequence cs2) {\n    if (cs1 == cs2) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (cs1 == null || cs2 == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    if (cs1 instanceof String && cs2 instanceof String) {\n        return cs1.equals(cs2);\n    }\n    return CharSequenceUtils.regionMatches(cs1, false, 0, cs2, 0, Math.max(cs1.length(), cs2.length()));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
