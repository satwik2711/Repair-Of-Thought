      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the issue is that the CSVFormat is set to not use a quote character, but the header is still being printed with quotes. This is because the CSVFormat's validate method is not correctly handling the case where the quote character is null. As a result, the header is not being printed at all.\nSuggestion: Check for null quote character in CSVFormat's validate method\nThe CSVFormat's validate method should check if the quote character is null and handle it accordingly. This can be done by adding a simple null check in the validate method. If the quote character is null, the method can either throw an exception or set a default quote character. This will ensure that the CSVPrinter is created with a valid format.\n// Buggy Function\npublic CSVPrinter(final Appendable out, final CSVFormat format) throws IOException {\n    Assertions.notNull(out, \"out\");\n    Assertions.notNull(format, \"format\");\n\n    this.out = out;\n    this.format = format;\n    this.format.validate();\n    // TODO: Is it a good idea to do this here instead of on the first call to a print method?\n    // It seems a pain to have to track whether the header has already been printed or not.\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the CSVFormat's validate method is not correctly handling the case where the quote character is null.
