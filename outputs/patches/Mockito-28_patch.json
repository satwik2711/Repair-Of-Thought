Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method is not correctly filtering the mock candidates. The method is supposed to filter the mock candidates based on the field type and the mock instance, but it seems to be injecting the mock into the wrong field. This is likely due to the fact that the `orderedInstanceFieldsFrom` method is returning the fields in a different order than expected, causing the mock injection to happen in the wrong field.\nSuggestion: Modify the Field Ordering\nOne possible fix is to modify the `orderedInstanceFieldsFrom` method to return the fields in the correct order. This could involve changing the ordering logic to prioritize fields with exact type matches over fields with ancestor type matches. This would ensure that the mock injection happens in the correct field.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is likely due to the fact that the `orderedInstanceFieldsFrom` method is returning the fields in a different order than expected, causing the mock injection to happen in the wrong field.\nSuggestion: Improve the Mock Candidate Filtering\nAnother possible fix is to improve the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method to correctly filter the mock candidates based on the field type and the mock instance. This could involve adding additional logic to handle cases where there are multiple fields with the same type, or where the mock instance is not a direct match for the field type.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is likely due to the fact that the `orderedInstanceFieldsFrom` method is returning the fields in a different order than expected, causing the mock injection to happen in the wrong field.\nSuggestion: Use a More Specific Field Matcher\nA third possible fix is to use a more specific field matcher in the `injectMockCandidate` method. Instead of using the `orderedInstanceFieldsFrom` method, which returns all fields of the class hierarchy, we could use a more specific matcher that only returns fields with exact type matches.
