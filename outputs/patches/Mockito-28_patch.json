      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `injectMockCandidate` function is not correctly filtering the mock candidates based on the field type. The function is using the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method to filter the mock candidates, but this method is not correctly implemented to prioritize exact type matches over ancestor type matches. As a result, the mock injection is not happening correctly, leading to the `AssertionFailedError`.\nSuggestion: Prioritize Exact Type Matches\nModify the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method to prioritize exact type matches over ancestor type matches. This can be done by checking if the field type is an exact match with the mock candidate type before checking for ancestor type matches. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(mocks, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

As a result, the mock injection is not happening correctly, leading to the `AssertionFailedError`.\nSuggestion: Use a More Specific Filter\nModify the `injectMockCandidate` function to use a more specific filter that takes into account the field type and the mock candidate type. This can be done by creating a new filter method that checks for exact type matches and ancestor type matches separately. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(mocks, field, fieldInstance) || \n            mockCandidateFilter.isAncestorTypeMatch(mocks, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This can be done by sorting the mock candidates based on their type matches, with exact type matches coming first. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    List<Object> sortedMocks = new ArrayList<>(mocks);\n    Collections.sort(sortedMocks, (o1, o2) -> {\n        if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(o1, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            return -1;\n        } else if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(o2, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    });\n    for(Object mock : sortedMocks) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mock, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
