      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `getCentralDirectoryLength()` function is not correctly implemented. It should return the length of the extra field in the central directory data, but instead, it returns the length of the local file data, which is not the same thing. This is causing the assertion to fail when the test expects a length of 0 but gets a length of 5.\nSuggestion: Correct Implementation\nThe correct implementation of the `getCentralDirectoryLength()` function should be based on the actual length of the extra field in the central directory data. This might involve parsing the central directory data and extracting the length of the extra field. The implementation would depend on the specific format of the central directory data. For example, if the central directory data is in the format of a ZIP file, the length of the extra field could be extracted from the ZIP file header.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ZipShort getCentralDirectoryLength() {\n        return getLocalFileDataLength();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is causing the assertion to fail when the test expects a length of 0 but gets a length of 5.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Method\nAnother possible solution is to use a different method to get the length of the extra field in the central directory data. For example, if there is a method that returns the length of the extra field, we could use that method instead of `getLocalFileDataLength()`. This would require careful analysis of the available methods and their behavior. For instance, we could use a method that calculates the length of the extra field based on the size of the local file data and the size of the central directory data.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ZipShort getCentralDirectoryLength() {\n        return getLocalFileDataLength();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the assertion to fail when the test expects a length of 0 but gets a length of 5.\nSuggestion: Handle Special Cases\nWe could also handle special cases where the length of the extra field in the central directory data is 0. In this case, we could return 0 directly, without calling `getLocalFileDataLength()`. This would require careful analysis of the possible values of the length and their behavior. For example, we could check if the local file data is empty, and if so, return 0 as the length of the extra field. This would ensure that the assertion passes when the test expects a length of 0.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ZipShort getCentralDirectoryLength() {\n        return getLocalFileDataLength();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
