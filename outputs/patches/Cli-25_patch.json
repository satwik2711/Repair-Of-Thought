      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the `renderWrappedText` function. The problem is that when the text is wrapped, the indentation is lost because the padding is added before wrapping. So, the padding should include the indentation instead.\n\nLooking at the original code, the padding is created using `createPadding(nextLineTabStop)`, which probably just adds spaces. But this approach doesn't account for the original indentation of the text.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the padding is added before wrapping, causing the indentation loss. So, the fix is to modify the padding string to include the indentation. How can I do that?\n\nHmm, maybe the `createPadding` function should take into account the current indentation level of the text. But how do I get that? Alternatively, perhaps the initial part of the text before wrapping has some indentation that needs to be preserved in subsequent lines.\n\nWait, in the original code, after the first wrap, the text is modified by adding padding and then trimming. That might be stripping the leading whitespace. So, the padding should instead include the necessary indentation so that when it's added, the wrapped lines are properly indented.\n\nSo, perhaps the `createPadding` function should be modified to include the original indentation. But the function doesn't have access to the original text's indentation. Alternatively, maybe the initial part of the text (before the first wrap) has an indentation that should be replicated in the padding.\n\nWait, let me think about the flow. The function starts by finding the wrap position, appends the first part, then for the remaining text, it adds padding. The issue is that the padding is just spaces, not considering any existing indentation.\n\nSo, perhaps the padding should be the same as the indentation of the original text. For example, if the text starts with 4 spaces, each wrapped line should also start with those 4 spaces plus any additional padding.\n\nBut how do I get the original indentation? Maybe the initial text's leading whitespace is the indentation. So, I can extract that and include it in the padding.\n\nWait, in the original code, the first part is `text.substring(0, pos)`, which is then trimmed. So, any leading whitespace in that part is kept. But when the remaining text is processed, it's being padded with `nextLineTabStop` spaces, which might not match the original indentation.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to capture the leading whitespace (indentation) of the original text and include that in the padding for the wrapped lines.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Extract the leading whitespace (indentation) from the original text.\n2. Modify the padding to include this indentation followed by the necessary spaces.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the padding is created once before the loop. So, if the indentation is extracted before the loop starts, it can be included in the padding.\n\nSo, in the fixed function:\n\n- Before the loop, get the leading whitespace of the text.\n- Create the padding as the leading whitespace plus the spaces from `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nWait, but `nextLineTabStop` might be the number of spaces to add after the indentation. Or perhaps the padding should be the indentation plus the tab stop spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding should be the same as the initial indentation of the text, so that each wrapped line starts with that indentation.\n\nWait, let's think about an example. Suppose the text is \"    Hello world, this is a test.\" with an initial indentation of 4 spaces. When it wraps, the next line should also start with 4 spaces.\n\nBut in the original code, the padding is `nextLineTabStop` spaces, which might not match the initial indentation. So, the padding should instead be the initial indentation.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Extract the leading whitespace from the original `text` to get the indentation.\n2. Create the padding using this indentation instead of just spaces from `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nBut wait, `nextLineTabStop` is an argument passed to the function. It's supposed to determine the tab stop for the next lines. So, perhaps the initial indentation is part of the padding, and the `nextLineTabStop` is the total width of the padding, including the initial indentation.\n\nWait, maybe the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation. Or perhaps it's the total number of spaces for the padding, and the initial indentation is part of that.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me look at the original code again.\n\nIn the original code, after the first wrap, the remaining text is processed by adding padding. The padding is created as `createPadding(nextLineTabStop)`, which is a string of spaces of length `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nBut this causes the wrapped lines to lose their original indentation because the padding is just spaces, not considering the initial indentation.\n\nSo, the fix is to modify the padding to include the initial indentation. So, the padding should be the initial indentation plus the necessary spaces to reach `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nWait, but `nextLineTabStop` might already include the initial indentation. Or perhaps not. I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial indentation should be preserved, and the padding should be added after that.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the initial indentation of the text and then create a padding that includes this indentation. Then, when the text is wrapped, each new line starts with this padding.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Extract the initial indentation from `text`.\n- Create the padding as this indentation.\n- Then, in the loop, when adding padding, it's the initial indentation plus any additional spaces if needed.\n\nWait, but `nextLineTabStop` is the parameter that dictates how much padding to add. So, perhaps the padding should be a combination of the initial indentation and the `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces for the padding, including the initial indentation. So, the initial indentation is part of the `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about how the code works.\n\nIn the original code, the padding is created once before the loop. So, perhaps the initial indentation is not being considered in the padding, leading to the loss of indentation in wrapped lines.\n\nSo, the solution is to include the initial indentation in the padding.\n\nHow can I extract the initial indentation? Well, the initial text may have leading whitespace. So, I can write a helper function to get the leading whitespace.\n\nFor example:\n\nString getIndentation(String text) {\n    int i = 0;\n    while (i < text.length() && Character.isWhitespace(text.charAt(i))) {\n        i++;\n    }\n    return text.substring(0, i);\n}\n\nThen, the padding would be this indentation.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the padding is `nextLineTabStop` spaces. So, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding should be the initial indentation plus `nextLineTabStop` spaces.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the intended behavior.\n\nThe function is supposed to wrap the text, and each new line after the first should be indented with `nextLineTabStop` spaces. But in reality, the initial text may already have some indentation, and the wrapped lines should preserve that.\n\nWait, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add as padding for the wrapped lines, but the initial indentation should be preserved.\n\nSo, the padding should be the initial indentation plus the `nextLineTabStop` spaces.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Maybe the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces for the padding, including the initial indentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial indentation is part of the text and should be preserved, and the `nextLineTabStop` is additional.\n\nI think the correct approach is to extract the initial indentation and then create the padding as that indentation. Because when the text is wrapped, each new line should start with the same indentation as the original line.\n\nSo, in the fixed function:\n\n1. Extract the initial indentation from the original `text`.\n2. Create the padding as this indentation.\n3. In the loop, when adding padding, use this indentation so that each wrapped line starts with it.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the padding is added before the text in each iteration. So, perhaps the initial indentation is being lost because the padding is just spaces, not including the original indentation.\n\nSo, the fix is to modify the padding to include the initial indentation.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Before the loop, get the initial indentation.\n- Create the padding as this indentation.\n- Then, in the loop, when adding padding, it's the initial indentation.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the padding is created once, outside the loop. So, perhaps that's where the problem is. The padding doesn't include the initial indentation, so each wrapped line starts with just spaces, not the original indentation.\n\nSo, the solution is to create the padding as the initial indentation plus the necessary spaces.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial indentation is part of the padding, and the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces, and the initial indentation is part of that.\n\nI think the correct approach is to extract the initial indentation and then create the padding as that indentation. Because the wrapped lines should have the same indentation as the original line.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Extract the initial indentation from `text`.\n2. Create the padding as this indentation.\n3. In the loop, when processing the remaining text, prepend this padding.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the padding is added as `padding + text.substring(pos).trim()`. So, if the padding includes the initial indentation, then each wrapped line will have that indentation.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, in the fixed function:\n\n- Before the loop, extract the initial indentation.\n- Create the padding as this indentation.\n- Then, in the loop, when processing the remaining text, use this padding.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the padding is created using `nextLineTabStop`. So, perhaps the initial indentation is separate from the `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nHmm, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces for the padding, including the initial indentation.\n\nI think the confusion arises because the `nextLineTabStop` is passed as an argument, but it's not clear whether it's the total padding or just additional padding.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the root cause is that the padding is added before wrapping, causing the indentation loss. So, the fix is to include the indentation in the padding.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Extract the initial indentation from `text`.\n- Create the padding as this indentation.\n- Use this padding in the loop.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the padding is created as `createPadding(nextLineTabStop)`, which is a string of spaces. So, perhaps the initial indentation is not being considered.\n\nSo, the fix is to modify `createPadding` to include the initial indentation.\n\nBut since the function `createPadding` is not provided, perhaps in the fixed code, we can adjust how the padding is created.\n\nSo, in the fixed function:\n\n- Extract the initial indentation.\n- Create the padding as the initial indentation.\n- Then, in the loop, when adding padding, use this string.\n\nWait, but `nextLineTabStop` is still a parameter. So, perhaps the padding should be the initial indentation plus `nextLineTabStop` spaces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact requirements, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial indentation should be preserved, and the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add for the wrapped lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces for the padding, including the initial indentation. So, if the initial indentation is 4 spaces, and `nextLineTabStop` is 8, then the padding would be 8 spaces, which would override the initial indentation.\n\nBut that might not be desired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of additional spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to capture the initial indentation and then, in the padding, include that indentation followed by the necessary spaces as per `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding should be the initial indentation plus `nextLineTabStop` spaces. So, the total padding length is initialIndentation.length() + nextLineTabStop.\n\nBut that might not be correct either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces, and the initial indentation is part of that. So, the padding is `nextLineTabStop` spaces, but the initial indentation is part of the text.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.\n\nIn the original code, the problem is that the padding is added before wrapping, which causes the indentation to be lost. So, the solution is to include the indentation in the padding.\n\nSo, perhaps the padding should be the initial indentation of the text, not just spaces based on `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, I'll extract the initial indentation and use that as the padding.\n\nLet me write the code steps:\n\n1. Extract the initial indentation from `text`.\n2. Create the padding as this indentation.\n3. In the loop, when processing the remaining text, prepend this padding.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the padding is added as `padding + text.substring(pos).trim()`. So, if the padding includes the initial indentation, then each wrapped line will have that indentation.\n\nYes, that should fix the issue.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Before the loop, get the initial indentation.\n- Set `padding` to this indentation.\n- Remove the `createPadding` call and just use this padding.\n\nWait, but `createPadding` might be doing something else, like handling tab stops or something. But according to the problem statement, the fix is to modify the padding string to include the indentation.\n\nSo, perhaps in the fixed code, the padding is the initial indentation.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nfinal String padding = initialIndent;\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\ntext = padding + text.substring(pos).trim();\n\nThis way, each wrapped line starts with the initial indentation.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial text doesn't have any indentation? Then, the padding would be an empty string, and the wrapped lines would start at the beginning, which is correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Extract the initial indentation from `text`.\n- Use this as the padding.\n- In the loop, prepend this padding to the remaining text after wrapping.\n\nSo, now, I need to implement this in the code.\n\nBut how do I extract the initial indentation?\n\nI can write a helper method inside the function:\n\nprivate String getIndentation(String text) {\n    int i = 0;\n    while (i < text.length() && Character.isWhitespace(text.charAt(i))) {\n        i++;\n    }\n    return text.substring(0, i);\n}\n\nThen, in the function:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nfinal String padding = initialIndent;\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the padding is created as `createPadding(nextLineTabStop)`. So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding should be the initial indentation plus the spaces from `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nWait, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nSo, the padding would be initialIndent + spaces, where spaces are of length `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nBut that might not be correct, as `nextLineTabStop` could be larger than the initial indentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces, and the initial indentation is part of that.\n\nBut without knowing the exact requirements, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add, and the initial indentation is separate.\n\nSo, the padding would be initialIndent + createPadding(nextLineTabStop).\n\nBut that would add both the initial indentation and the spaces, which might be more than intended.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial indentation should be preserved, and the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after wrapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to prepend to each wrapped line, but the initial indentation should also be preserved.\n\nSo, the padding would be initialIndent + spaces, where spaces are `nextLineTabStop` in length.\n\nBut that would make the total padding longer than `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces, and the initial indentation is part of that.\n\nSo, the padding would be a string of length `nextLineTabStop`, consisting of the initial indentation followed by spaces to make up the total length.\n\nFor example, if initialIndent is 4 spaces and nextLineTabStop is 8, then padding is 4 spaces + 4 spaces = 8 spaces.\n\nBut that would mean that the initial indentation is part of the padding, and the total padding is nextLineTabStop.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nint paddingLength = nextLineTabStop;\nString padding = initialIndent;\nif (padding.length() < paddingLength) {\n    padding += createPadding(paddingLength - padding.length());\n} else {\n    padding = padding.substring(0, paddingLength);\n}\n\nBut this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add, and the initial indentation is separate. So, the padding is initialIndent + createPadding(nextLineTabStop).\n\nBut that would make the padding longer than nextLineTabStop.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is that the padding is not including the initial indentation, causing the wrapped lines to lose it.\n\nSo, the simplest fix is to set the padding to the initial indentation.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nfinal String padding = initialIndent;\n\nThen, in the loop:\n\ntext = padding + text.substring(pos).trim();\n\nThis way, each wrapped line starts with the initial indentation.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the padding is added before the text, which is then trimmed. So, perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, the fixed function would extract the initial indentation and use it as the padding.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nprotected StringBuffer renderWrappedText(StringBuffer sb, int width, \n                                         int nextLineTabStop, String text)\n{\n    int pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n\n    if (pos == -1)\n    {\n        sb.append(rtrim(text));\n        return sb;\n    }\n    sb.append(rtrim(text.substring(0, pos))).append(defaultNewLine);\n\n    if (nextLineTabStop >= width)\n    {\n        nextLineTabStop = width - 1;\n    }\n\n    // Extract initial indentation\n    String initialIndent = \"\";\n    int i = 0;\n    while (i < text.length() && Character.isWhitespace(text.charAt(i))) {\n        i++;\n    }\n    initialIndent = text.substring(0, i);\n\n    final String padding = initialIndent;\n\n    while (true)\n    {\n        text = padding + text.substring(pos).trim();\n        pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n\n        if (pos == -1)\n        {\n            sb.append(text);\n            return sb;\n        }\n        \n        if ( (text.length() > width) && (pos == nextLineTabStop - 1) ) \n        {\n            pos = width;\n        }\n\n        sb.append(rtrim(text.substring(0, pos))).append(defaultNewLine);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in this code, I removed the `createPadding` function and replaced it with the initial indentation. But what if the initial indentation is empty? Then, the padding would be empty, which might cause issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding should be the initial indentation plus the spaces from `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The problem is that the original code uses `nextLineTabStop` to create the padding, which is just spaces, causing the loss of indentation.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to include the initial indentation in the padding, regardless of `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nBut then, what is the role of `nextLineTabStop` in this function? It's passed as an argument, but perhaps it's not needed anymore if we're using the initial indentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact requirements, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total number of spaces, and the initial indentation is part of that. So, the padding should be the initial indentation, and if it's shorter than `nextLineTabStop`, add spaces to make it that length.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is not needed anymore, and the padding is just the initial indentation.\n\nBut that might not be correct, as `nextLineTabStop` is passed for a reason.\n\nHmm, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation. So, the padding would be initialIndent + spaces, where spaces are `nextLineTabStop` in length.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nString spaces = createPadding(nextLineTabStop);\nfinal String padding = initialIndent + spaces;\n\nBut then, the total padding length would be initialIndent.length() + nextLineTabStop.\n\nBut perhaps that's not intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total padding length, and the initial indentation is part of it.\n\nSo, the padding would be initialIndent padded with spaces to make the total length `nextLineTabStop`.\n\nSo, if initialIndent is 4 and nextLineTabStop is 8, then padding is initialIndent + 4 spaces.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nint paddingLength = nextLineTabStop;\nString padding = initialIndent;\nif (padding.length() < paddingLength) {\n    padding += createPadding(paddingLength - padding.length());\n} else {\n    padding = padding.substring(0, paddingLength);\n}\n\nBut this requires the `createPadding` function, which is not provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add, and the initial indentation is separate.\n\nIn that case, the padding would be initialIndent + createPadding(nextLineTabStop).\n\nBut that would make the padding longer than nextLineTabStop.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let me try to proceed with the initial approach: extract the initial indentation and use it as the padding, ignoring `nextLineTabStop` for the padding.\n\nBut that might not be correct, as `nextLineTabStop` is passed as an argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the number of spaces to add after the initial indentation.\n\nSo, the padding would be initialIndent + spaces, where spaces are `nextLineTabStop` in length.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nString spaces = createPadding(nextLineTabStop);\nfinal String padding = initialIndent + spaces;\n\nBut then, the padding's length is initialIndent.length() + nextLineTabStop.\n\nBut perhaps that's not intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `nextLineTabStop` is the total padding length, and the initial indentation is part of it.\n\nSo, the padding is initialIndent, and if it's shorter than nextLineTabStop, pad with spaces.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nString initialIndent = getIndentation(text);\nint paddingLength = nextLineTabStop;\nString padding = initialIndent;\nif (padding.length() < paddingLength) {",
      "protected StringBuffer renderWrappedText(StringBuffer sb, int width, \n                                         int nextLineTabStop, String text)\n{\n    int pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n\n    if (pos == -1)\n    {\n        sb.append(rtrim(text));\n        return sb;\n    }\n    sb.append(rtrim(text.substring(0, pos))).append(defaultNewLine);\n\n    if (nextLineTabStop >= width)\n    {\n        nextLineTabStop = width - 1;\n    }\n\n    final String padding = createPadding(nextLineTabStop);\n\n    while (true)\n    {\n        text = text.substring(pos).trim();\n        pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n\n        if (pos == -1)\n        {\n            sb.append(padding).append(text);\n            return sb;\n        }\n        \n        if ((text.length() > width) && (pos == nextLineTabStop - 1))\n        {\n            pos = width;\n        }\n\n        sb.append(padding).append(rtrim(text.substring(0, pos))).append(defaultNewLine);\n    }\n}"
