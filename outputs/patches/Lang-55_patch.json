      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `stopTime` is being updated with the current time in the `stop()` method, regardless of whether the stopwatch was previously suspended or not. This means that if the stopwatch was suspended and then stopped, the `stopTime` will be updated with the current time, which is not the correct behavior. The correct behavior should be to keep the `suspendTime` as the `stopTime` if the stopwatch was previously suspended.\nSuggestion: Update stopTime only if not suspended\nUpdate the `stopTime` only if the stopwatch was not previously suspended. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check the `runningState` before updating the `stopTime`. Here is the updated `stop()` method:\n```java\npublic void stop() {\n    if(this.runningState != STATE_RUNNING && this.runningState != STATE_SUSPENDED) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Stopwatch is not running. \");\n    }\n    if (this.runningState == STATE_RUNNING) {\n        this.stopTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    }\n    this.runningState = STATE_STOPPED;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic void stop() {\n    if(this.runningState != STATE_RUNNING && this.runningState != STATE_SUSPENDED) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Stopwatch is not running. \");\n    }\n        stopTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    this.runningState = STATE_STOPPED;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
