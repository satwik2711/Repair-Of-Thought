      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `stopTime` is being set to the current time when the `stop()` method is called, instead of calculating the total time elapsed since the stopwatch was started. This is because the `stopTime` is being set to `System.currentTimeMillis()` without considering the time that has already passed since the stopwatch was started.\nSuggestion: Calculate Total Time Elapsed\nCalculate the total time elapsed by subtracting the start time from the current time. This can be done by adding a `startTime` field to the `StopWatch` class and setting it to `System.currentTimeMillis()` when the `start()` method is called. Then, in the `stop()` method, calculate the total time elapsed by subtracting the `startTime` from the current time.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void stop() {\n    if(this.runningState != STATE_RUNNING && this.runningState != STATE_SUSPENDED) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Stopwatch is not running. \");\n    }\n        stopTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    this.runningState = STATE_STOPPED;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
