      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `handleRawtext` function is not correctly handling the meta tag because it is transitioning to the Text state after inserting the start tag, which causes the subsequent HTML tags to be treated as text instead of being parsed as HTML.\nSuggestion: Handle Meta Tag Separately\nOne possible fix is to add a special case for the meta tag in the `handleRawtext` function. This would involve checking if the start tag is a meta tag and handling it separately, without transitioning to the Text state. This would ensure that the meta tag is correctly parsed as HTML.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n    tb.markInsertionMode();\n    tb.transition(Text);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

Instead of transitioning to the Text state, the function could transition to a state that is specifically designed for handling raw text, such as the `Rawtext` state. This would ensure that the subsequent HTML tags are correctly parsed as HTML.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n    tb.markInsertionMode();\n    tb.transition(Text);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Instead of transitioning to the Rawtext state, the function could transition to a state that is specifically designed for handling HTML tags, such as the `Tag` state. This would ensure that the subsequent HTML tags are correctly parsed as HTML.\n\nHere is the modified code for each suggestion:\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n    tb.markInsertionMode();\n    tb.transition(Text);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
