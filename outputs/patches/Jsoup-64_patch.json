      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `handleRawtext` function is not properly handling the meta tag. Specifically, it is not recognizing the meta tag as a self-closing tag and is instead treating it as a regular tag that needs to be closed. This is causing the meta tag to be escaped in the output.\nSuggestion: Check for Self-Closing Tags\nOne potential fix is to modify the `handleRawtext` function to check if the current tag is a self-closing tag. If it is, the function can skip the step of transitioning to the Text state and instead move on to the next tag. This would ensure that self-closing tags like the meta tag are properly handled.\n\n```java\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    if (startTag.isSelfClosing()) {\n        tb.transition(Data);\n    } else {\n        tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n        tb.markInsertionMode();\n        tb.transition(Text);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n    tb.markInsertionMode();\n    tb.transition(Text);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

Specifically, it is not recognizing the meta tag as a self-closing tag and is instead treating it as a regular tag that needs to be closed. This is causing the meta tag to be escaped in the output.\nSuggestion: Use a More Specific Transition\nAnother potential fix is to modify the `handleRawtext` function to use a more specific transition when handling the meta tag. Instead of transitioning to the Text state, the function could transition to a state that is specifically designed to handle self-closing tags. This would ensure that the meta tag is properly handled and that the output is correct.\n\n```java\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    if (startTag.name().equals(\"meta\")) {\n        tb.transition(SelfClosingStartTag);\n    } else {\n        tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n        tb.markInsertionMode();\n        tb.transition(Text);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n    tb.markInsertionMode();\n    tb.transition(Text);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Specifically, it is not recognizing the meta tag as a self-closing tag and is instead treating it as a regular tag that needs to be closed. This is causing the meta tag to be escaped in the output.\nSuggestion: Add a Special Case for Meta Tags\nA third potential fix is to add a special case to the `handleRawtext` function to handle meta tags. The function could check if the current tag is a meta tag and if so, handle it differently than other tags. This would ensure that meta tags are properly handled and that the output is correct.\n\n```java\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    if (startTag.name().equals(\"meta\")) {\n        tb.insertEndTag(startTag);\n    } else {\n        tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n        tb.markInsertionMode();\n        tb.transition(Text);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static void handleRawtext(Token.StartTag startTag, HtmlTreeBuilder tb) {\n    tb.insert(startTag);\n    tb.tokeniser.transition(TokeniserState.Rawtext);\n    tb.markInsertionMode();\n    tb.transition(Text);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
