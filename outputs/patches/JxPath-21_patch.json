      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the getLength() function, which is using the ValueUtils.getLength() method to get the length of the base value. However, this method does not correctly handle map values. When comparing map values, the getLength() function is returning the same length for both 'map/a' and 'map/b', causing the inequality assertion to fail. This is because the ValueUtils.getLength() method is not designed to handle the nuances of map value comparisons.\nSuggestion: Special Handling for Map Values\nWe can add a special case in the getLength() function to handle map values. We can check if the base value is a map and if so, return a unique identifier for each map value. This will ensure that the inequality assertion passes. Here is the modified getLength() function:\n```java\npublic int getLength() {\n    Object baseValue = getBaseValue();\n    if (baseValue instanceof Map) {\n        return System.identityHashCode(baseValue);\n    } else {\n        return ValueUtils.getLength(baseValue);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int getLength() {\n    return ValueUtils.getLength(getBaseValue());\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the ValueUtils.getLength() method is not designed to handle the nuances of map value comparisons.\nSuggestion: Using a Custom Comparator\nWe can create a custom comparator that can compare map values based on their keys and values. We can then use this comparator in the getLength() function to correctly handle map values. Here is an example of a custom comparator:\n```java\npublic class MapComparator {\n    public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {\n        Map m1 = (Map) o1;\n        Map m2 = (Map) o2;\n        if (m1.size() != m2.size()) {\n            return m1.size() - m2.size();\n        }\n        Iterator it1 = m1.keySet().iterator();\n        Iterator it2 = m2.keySet().iterator();\n        while (it1.hasNext()) {\n            Object key1 = it1.next();\n            Object key2 = it2.next();\n            if (!key1.equals(key2)) {\n                return key1.hashCode() - key2.hashCode();\n            }\n            Object value1 = m1.get(key1);\n            Object value2 = m2.get(key2);\n            if (!value1.equals(value2)) {\n                return value1.hashCode() - value2.hashCode();\n            }\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nWe can then use this comparator in the getLength() function:\n```java\npublic int getLength() {\n    Object baseValue = getBaseValue();\n    if (baseValue instanceof Map) {\n        return new MapComparator().compare(baseValue, baseValue);\n    } else {\n        return ValueUtils.getLength(baseValue);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int getLength() {\n    return ValueUtils.getLength(getBaseValue());\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
