      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the calculation of the p-value in the `calculateAsymptoticPValue` method. The method uses the normal approximation of the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is only valid for large sample sizes. However, the calculation of the standard deviation `VarU` is incorrect. The correct formula for the variance of the Mann-Whitney U statistic is `VarU = (n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1)) / 12.0 - (n1 * n2 * (n1 * n2 - 1)) / (12.0 * (n1 + n2) * (n1 + n2 - 1))`. The incorrect calculation of `VarU` leads to an incorrect calculation of the standard deviation, which in turn affects the calculation of the p-value.\nSuggestion: Correct Calculation of Variance\nThe calculation of `VarU` should be corrected to use the correct formula. This can be achieved by replacing the line `final double VarU = n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12.0;` with `final double VarU = (n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1)) / 12.0 - (n1 * n2 * (n1 * n2 - 1)) / (12.0 * (n1 + n2) * (n1 + n2 - 1));`.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate double calculateAsymptoticPValue(final double Umin,\n                                         final int n1,\n                                         final int n2)\n    throws ConvergenceException, MaxCountExceededException {\n\n    final int n1n2prod = n1 * n2;\n\n    // http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U#Normal_approximation\n    final double EU = n1n2prod / 2.0;\n    final double VarU = n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12.0;\n\n    final double z = (Umin - EU) / FastMath.sqrt(VarU);\n\n    final NormalDistribution standardNormal = new NormalDistribution(0, 1);\n\n    return 2 * standardNormal.cumulativeProbability(z);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
