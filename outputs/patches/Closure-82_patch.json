      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `isEmptyType()` function is not correctly identifying the type of `String.prototype.toLowerCase` because it only checks for `NoType`, `NoObjectType`, or `NoResolvedType`. However, in this scenario, the type of `String.prototype.toLowerCase` is not one of these, but rather a `String` type. The function is not considering the case where the type is a `String` type, which is why it is not correctly identifying the type and not emitting a warning.\nSuggestion: Add String Type Check\nWe can modify the `isEmptyType()` function to also check if the type is a `String` type. This can be done by adding a new condition to the function, such as `isStringType()`. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of `String.prototype.toLowerCase` and emits a warning if necessary. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic final boolean isEmptyType() {\n  return isNoType() || isNoObjectType() || isNoResolvedType() || isStringType();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic final boolean isEmptyType() {\n  return isNoType() || isNoObjectType() || isNoResolvedType();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function is not considering the case where the type is a `String` type, which is why it is not correctly identifying the type and not emitting a warning.\nSuggestion: Modify isNoObjectType() to Include String Type\nAnother possible fix is to modify the `isNoObjectType()` function to also include the `String` type. This will ensure that the `isEmptyType()` function correctly identifies the type of `String.prototype.toLowerCase` and emits a warning if necessary. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic final boolean isNoObjectType() {\n  // existing code...\n  return type == null || type.isStringType() || type.isNoObjectType();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic final boolean isEmptyType() {\n  return isNoType() || isNoObjectType() || isNoResolvedType();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
