      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the 'matchesLetter' function in the Jsoup parser is not correctly handling non-ASCII characters. The function is checking if the current character is a letter by comparing it to the ASCII values of 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z'. However, this does not cover non-ASCII characters, which are used in the test case.\nSuggestion: Use Unicode Character Properties\nThe 'matchesLetter' function can be modified to use Unicode character properties to check if the current character is a letter. This can be done using the 'Character.isLetter' method in Java. The corrected function should look like this:\nboolean matchesLetter() {\n    if (isEmpty())\n        return false;\n    char c = input[pos];\n    return Character.isLetter(c);\n}\n// Buggy Function\nboolean matchesLetter() {\n    if (isEmpty())\n        return false;\n    char c = input[pos];\n    return (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') || (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z');\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

However, this does not cover non-ASCII characters, which are used in the test case.\nSuggestion: Use a Regular Expression\nAnother approach is to use a regular expression to match the current character against a pattern that includes all Unicode letters. This can be done using the 'String.matches' method in Java. The corrected function should look like this:\nboolean matchesLetter() {\n    if (isEmpty())\n        return false;\n    char c = input[pos];\n    return String.valueOf(c).matches(\"\\\\p{L}\");\n}\n// Buggy Function\nboolean matchesLetter() {\n    if (isEmpty())\n        return false;\n    char c = input[pos];\n    return (c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') || (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z');\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

However, this does not cover non-ASCII characters, which are used in the test case.\nSuggestion: Use a Unicode Character Range\nWe can also modify the 'matchesLetter' function to check if the current character falls within a specific Unicode character range that includes all letters. This can be done by checking if the character's Unicode code point falls within the range of Unicode letters.
