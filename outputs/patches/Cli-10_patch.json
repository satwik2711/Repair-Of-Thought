      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the `setOptions` method of the `Parser` class. When the `Options` instance is reused, the `requiredOptions` field is not updated correctly. This is because the `requiredOptions` field is set to the result of `options.getRequiredOptions()` only once, when the `Options` instance is first set. If the `Options` instance is modified later (e.g., by adding or removing required options), the `requiredOptions` field will not reflect these changes. As a result, the parser will not correctly enforce the required options when reusing the same `Options` instance.\nSuggestion: Update `requiredOptions` on Each `setOptions` Call\nUpdate the `setOptions` method to update the `requiredOptions` field every time it is called, rather than just once when the `Options` instance is first set. This can be achieved by moving the line `this.requiredOptions = options.getRequiredOptions();` inside the `setOptions` method.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected void setOptions(final Options options) {\n        this.options = options;\n        this.requiredOptions = options.getRequiredOptions();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
