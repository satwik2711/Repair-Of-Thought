      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `mapping` object is null because it is not initialized when the CSV record has no header. In the `CSVRecord` class, the `mapping` object is initialized when the record has a header. However, in the case of a record with no header, the `mapping` object remains null, causing the `NullPointerException` when trying to iterate over its entries.\nSuggestion: Initialize Mapping Object with Default Values\nWe can initialize the `mapping` object with default values when the CSV record has no header. This can be done by adding a null check for the `mapping` object and initializing it with a new `HashMap` if it is null. This solution is simple and effective, but it may not be the desired behavior in all cases.\n// Buggy Function\n<M extends Map<String, String>> M putIn(final M map) {\n    for (final Entry<String, Integer> entry : mapping.entrySet()) {\n        final int col = entry.getValue().intValue();\n        if (col < values.length) {\n            map.put(entry.getKey(), values[col]);\n        }\n    }\n    return map;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

In the `CSVRecord` class, the `mapping` object is initialized when the record has a header. However, in the case of a record with no header, the `mapping` object remains null, causing the `NullPointerException` when trying to iterate over its entries.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Data Structure\nWe can use a different data structure, such as a `TreeMap`, that can handle null keys and values.
