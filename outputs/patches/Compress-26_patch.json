This is causing the function to skip less than the requested number of bytes.\nSuggestion: Use Read Method to Skip Remaining Bytes\nInstead of breaking out of the loop when the skip method returns 0, we can use the read method to skip the remaining bytes. We can do this by reading the remaining bytes into a buffer and then discarding the buffer. This will ensure that the function skips the correct number of bytes.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static long skip(InputStream input, long numToSkip) throws IOException {\n    long available = numToSkip;\n    while (numToSkip > 0) {\n        long skipped = input.skip(numToSkip);\n        if (skipped == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        numToSkip -= skipped;\n    }\n        \n    return available - numToSkip;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the function to skip less than the requested number of bytes.\nSuggestion: Continue Looping Until All Bytes Skipped\nAnother potential fix is to continue looping until all the bytes have been skipped. We can do this by removing the break statement and instead continuing to loop until the numToSkip variable is 0. However, this approach may not be efficient as it may lead to infinite looping if the skip method always returns 0. To avoid this, we can add a condition to check if the skip method has returned 0 for a certain number of iterations, and if so, use the read method to skip the remaining bytes.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static long skip(InputStream input, long numToSkip) throws IOException {\n    long available = numToSkip;\n    while (numToSkip > 0) {\n        long skipped = input.skip(numToSkip);\n        if (skipped == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        numToSkip -= skipped;\n    }\n        \n    return available - numToSkip;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the function to skip less than the requested number of bytes.\nSuggestion: Use a Hybrid Approach to Skip Bytes\nA third potential fix is to use a hybrid approach that combines the skip and read methods. We can use the skip method to skip as many bytes as possible, and then use the read method to skip the remaining bytes. This approach can be more efficient than using the read method alone, as it can take advantage of the skip method's ability to skip large blocks of bytes. However, it requires careful implementation to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the skip method returns 0 before the requested number of bytes has been skipped.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static long skip(InputStream input, long numToSkip) throws IOException {\n    long available = numToSkip;\n    while (numToSkip > 0) {\n        long skipped = input.skip(numToSkip);\n        if (skipped == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        numToSkip -= skipped;\n    }\n        \n    return available - numToSkip;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
