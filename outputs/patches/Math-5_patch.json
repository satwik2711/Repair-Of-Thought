Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the function is not correctly handling the case when the complex number is zero. In the current implementation, when the real and imaginary parts are both zero, the function returns `NaN` immediately. However, this is not the correct behavior for the reciprocal of zero, which should be infinity. The function is also not correctly handling the case when the complex number is zero in the subsequent conditions.\nSuggestion: Correctly Handle Zero Complex Number\nThe function should return infinity when the complex number is zero. We can add a condition to check if the complex number is zero and return infinity immediately. This can be achieved by modifying the function as follows:\n```java\npublic Complex reciprocal() {\n    if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0) {\n        return INF;\n    }\n    // rest of the function remains the same\n}\n```\nThis solution correctly handles the case when the complex number is zero and returns infinity as expected.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Complex reciprocal() {\n    if (isNaN) {\n        return NaN;\n    }\n\n    if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0) {\n        return NaN;\n    }\n\n    if (isInfinite) {\n        return ZERO;\n    }\n\n    if (FastMath.abs(real) < FastMath.abs(imaginary)) {\n        double q = real / imaginary;\n        double scale = 1. / (real * q + imaginary);\n        return createComplex(scale * q, -scale);\n    } else {\n        double q = imaginary / real;\n        double scale = 1. / (imaginary * q + real);\n        return createComplex(scale, -scale * q);\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

However, this is not the correct behavior for the reciprocal of zero, which should be infinity.
