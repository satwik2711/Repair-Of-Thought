      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this buggy Java function called parseOctal. The problem is that it doesn't handle input buffers with a length of 12 or more correctly, which can cause an overflow when parsing the octal string. The function currently uses a long to store the result, but longs have a maximum value, so when the input is too big, it overflows and throws an exception.\n\nThe root cause is that the function doesn't check if the length is greater than 11. Since each octal digit represents 3 bits, 12 digits would be 36 bits, which is more than a long can hold (since a long is 64 bits, but signed, so max is 63 bits). Wait, actually, 12 digits would be 12 * 3 = 36 bits, which is less than 64. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, the issue arises when the parsed value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE. So for lengths longer than 11, the value could be larger than what a long can hold, leading to incorrect parsing or an exception.\n\nThe suggestion was to modify the function to return a BigInteger instead of a long. But the user's instructions say to maintain the original method signature. So I can't change the return type. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, the original function returns a long. So if the input buffer represents a number larger than Long.MAX_VALUE, it will overflow and cause an incorrect value or an exception. So how can we handle that?\n\nBut the user's fix suggestion was to change the return type to BigInteger, but since the instructions say not to modify the method signature, I can't do that. So I need another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when the length is 12 or more, the parsing logic might not handle it correctly. Let me look at the original code.\n\nIn the original code, after skipping leading spaces and trimming trailing NULs or spaces, it loops through each byte, shifting the result left by 3 and adding the current digit. But if the result exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE, it will cause an overflow, leading to a negative number or some incorrect value, which might cause an exception elsewhere.\n\nSo, the problem is that the function doesn't check if the parsed value exceeds the maximum long value. Therefore, when the input is too long (like 12 digits), it can cause an overflow.\n\nSo, to fix this, I need to ensure that the parsed value doesn't exceed Long.MAX_VALUE. If it does, perhaps we should throw an IllegalArgumentException, similar to how it's done for invalid characters.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Keep the function returning a long.\n2. After parsing each digit, check if the result exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE. If it does, throw an exception.\n3. Also, ensure that the length is not more than 11, since 11 digits in octal can be up to 2^36 -1, which is less than Long.MAX_VALUE (2^63 -1). Wait, 11 octal digits would be 36 bits, so 2^36 is about 68 billion, which is way less than Long.MAX_VALUE (about 9e18). So 12 digits would be 3^12 = 531441, but in terms of bits, 12 digits are 36 bits, which is still within the 64-bit long. Wait, no, 12 digits in octal would be up to 8^12 -1, which is 68,719,476,735. That's about 6.8e10, which is still less than Long.MAX_VALUE (9e18). So why is the original function causing an overflow?\n\nWait, maybe the issue is not with the number of digits but with the parsing logic. Let me think: each iteration does result = (result << 3) + (currentByte - '0'). So for each byte, it's shifting left by 3 bits and adding the new digit.\n\nIf the buffer is longer than 11, say 12 bytes, then the loop runs 12 times. Each shift is 3 bits, so 12 shifts would be 36 bits. But a long is 64 bits, so 36 bits is fine. So why would it overflow?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the function doesn't check the maximum value after each shift. For example, if the result after a shift would exceed Long.MAX_VALUE, it should throw an exception.\n\nSo, the approach is to, after each shift and add, check if the result is greater than Long.MAX_VALUE. If it is, throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the maximum possible value for the given length. For example, if the length is n, the maximum is (8^(n) -1). We can check if this maximum exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE. If it does, then the function cannot handle it and should throw an exception.\n\nWait, but for n=12, 8^12 is 68,719,476,736, which is less than Long.MAX_VALUE (9,223,372,036,854,775,807). So 12 digits are okay. Wait, 8^12 is 68,719,476,736, which is 6.8e10, which is way less than 9e18. So why is the function causing an overflow?\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is not with the length but with the way the function handles leading zeros or something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the root cause description: the function doesn't handle lengths greater than 11, which can cause overflow. But according to the calculation, 12 digits should be okay. So perhaps the issue is that the function allows lengths longer than 11, which can cause the parsed value to exceed Long.MAX_VALUE in some cases.\n\nWait, for example, if the buffer has 13 digits. 8^13 is 549,755,813,888, which is about 5.4e11, still less than Long.MAX_VALUE. Wait, 8^20 is 1,099,511,627,776 which is about 1e12, still less than 9e18. Wait, 8^21 is 8,796,093,022,208, which is 8e12, still less than 9e18. Hmm, so when does it exceed?\n\nWait, 8^22 is 69,672,744,177,664, which is 6.9e13, still less than 9e18. 8^30 is about 1e27, which is way larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9e18). So for lengths up to 21 digits, 8^21 is 8e12, which is okay. 22 digits would be 6.9e13, which is still less than 9e18. Wait, 8^24 is 8^24 = 1,125,899,906,842,624, which is 1.125e18, which is still less than Long.MAX_VALUE (9e18). So 24 digits would be okay. 25 digits would be 8^25 = 9,007,199,254,740,992, which is just over Long.MAX_VALUE (9,223,372,036,854,775,807). So 25 digits would cause the parsed value to exceed Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nWait, but the function allows any length as long as it's at least 2. So if someone passes a buffer with, say, 25 digits, the function will parse it into a long, which would overflow, resulting in a negative number or incorrect value.\n\nSo the bug is that the function doesn't check whether the parsed value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE, leading to overflow.\n\nSo the solution is to, during parsing, after each step, check if the result exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE. If it does, throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn the loop where we process each byte:\n\nfor (; start < end; start++) {\n    final byte currentByte = buffer[start];\n    if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n    }\n    result = (result << 3) + (currentByte - '0');\n}\n\nAfter this line, we need to check if result has exceeded Long.MAX_VALUE. If yes, throw an exception.\n\nBut wait, since we're dealing with octal digits, each digit is 0-7, so the value is always non-negative. So after each step, if the result exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE, we can throw an exception.\n\nSo, the modified code would have:\n\nfor (; start < end; start++) {\n    final byte currentByte = buffer[start];\n    if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n    }\n    result = (result << 3) + (currentByte - '0');\n    if (result > Long.MAX_VALUE) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Octal value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE\");\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but what if the result is exactly Long.MAX_VALUE? That's okay, but adding another digit would cause it to exceed. So perhaps after each shift and add, we should check if the result is greater than Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nWait, but Long.MAX_VALUE is 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. So any result beyond that is invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (result > Long.MAX_VALUE) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\n\nBut wait, let's think about the maximum possible value for a given length. For example, if the length is 25, the maximum is 8^25 -1, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE. So, in that case, the function should throw an exception.\n\nSo, the approach is to add a check after each digit is added to the result. If the result exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE, throw an exception.\n\nBut wait, what about when the result is exactly Long.MAX_VALUE? That's acceptable, but adding another digit would cause it to exceed. So the check should be after each step.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\nresult = (result << 3) + (currentByte - '0');\nif (result > Long.MAX_VALUE) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\n\nBut wait, what if the result is exactly Long.MAX_VALUE? That's allowed, but only if it's the last digit. Otherwise, if there are more digits, adding them would cause overflow.\n\nWait, no. Because each digit adds 3 bits. So, for example, if the current result is such that shifting left by 3 and adding the next digit would exceed Long.MAX_VALUE, then we should throw an exception before doing that shift.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate whether adding the next digit would cause an overflow before performing the shift and add.\n\nSo, for each digit, we can check if the current result is greater than (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8. Because when you shift left by 3, it's equivalent to multiplying by 8, then adding the digit.\n\nWait, perhaps using the method from Java's Long class for parsing, like Long.parseLong, which does similar checks.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a helper function to check for overflow before each operation.\n\nSo, the idea is, before doing result = result * 8 + digit, check whether result exceeds (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8. If it does, then multiplying by 8 would cause overflow.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlong digit = currentByte - '0';\nif (result > (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\nresult = result * 8 + digit;\n\nWait, but in the current code, it's using result << 3, which is equivalent to multiplying by 8. So, the same logic applies.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified to include this check before each shift and add.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\nfor (; start < end; start++) {\n    final byte currentByte = buffer[start];\n    if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n    }\n    long digit = currentByte - '0';\n    if (result > (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Octal value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE\");\n    }\n    result = result * 8 + digit;\n}\n\nWait, but wait: (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8 could be negative if digit is large. So perhaps a better way is to compute whether (result * 8) would exceed Long.MAX_VALUE - digit.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the maximum safe value for result before adding the digit.\n\nSo, the maximum value that result can have before multiplying by 8 and adding digit is (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8.\n\nIf result exceeds this value, then the operation would cause an overflow.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlong maxSafe = (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8;\nif (result > maxSafe) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\nresult = result * 8 + digit;\n\nThis way, we prevent the overflow before it happens.\n\nSo, integrating this into the function.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the initial check for length < 2. But according to the problem, the function should also handle lengths greater than 11 correctly. So, perhaps the function should also check if the length is too long, but given that a long can hold up to 18 or so octal digits (since 8^21 is about 8e6, which is way less than Long.MAX_VALUE), perhaps the length check isn't necessary. Instead, the per-digit check is sufficient.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. In the loop where each byte is processed, after checking that it's a valid octal digit, extract the digit as a long.\n\n2. Compute the maximum safe value that result can have before multiplying by 8 and adding the digit.\n\n3. If the current result exceeds this maximum, throw an exception.\n\n4. Otherwise, update the result.\n\nSo, modifying the code accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about the original code. It uses result << 3, which is equivalent to result * 8. So, the same logic applies.\n\nSo, the code inside the loop becomes:\n\nfinal byte currentByte = buffer[start];\nif (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\nlong digit = currentByte - '0';\nif (result > (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Octal value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE\");\n}\nresult = result * 8 + digit;\n\nAlternatively, since shifting is used, perhaps we can compute whether (result << 3) would overflow before adding the digit.\n\nBut shifting left by 3 is the same as multiplying by 8, so the same approach applies.\n\nSo, implementing this check in the loop.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: The buffer has exactly the maximum value that fits in a long. For example, Long.MAX_VALUE in octal.\n\nBut wait, Long.MAX_VALUE is 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF in hex, which is 9223372036854775807 in decimal. Converting that to octal: let's see, but it's a big number. The point is, if the buffer represents exactly Long.MAX_VALUE, the function should return it without throwing an exception.\n\nCase 2: The buffer represents a value that is one more than Long.MAX_VALUE. The function should throw an exception.\n\nCase 3: The buffer has leading zeros. The function should handle that correctly.\n\nCase 4: The buffer has trailing spaces or NULs, which the function trims correctly.\n\nSo, the function's original logic for trimming and leading spaces is correct, but the overflow check is missing.\n\nSo, the final plan is to add the overflow check inside the loop after each digit is processed.\n\nNow, let's write the corrected code.\n\nThe original function is:\n\npublic static long parseOctal(final byte[] buffer, final int offset, final int length) {\n    long    result = 0;\n    int     end = offset + length;\n    int     start = offset;\n\n    if (length < 2){\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Length \"+length+\" must be at least 2\");\n    }\n\n    if (buffer[start] == 0) {\n        return 0L;\n    }\n\n    // Skip leading spaces\n    while (start < end){\n        if (buffer[start] == ' '){\n            start++;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Trim all trailing NULs and spaces.\n    // The ustar and POSIX tar specs require a trailing NUL or\n    // space but some implementations use the extra digit for big\n    // sizes/uids/gids ...\n    byte trailer = buffer[end - 1];\n    if (trailer == 0 || trailer == ' '){\n        end--;\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n                exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, end-1, trailer));\n    }\n    trailer = buffer[end - 1];\n    while (start < end - 1 && (trailer == 0 || trailer == ' ')) {\n        end--;\n        trailer = buffer[end - 1];\n    }\n\n    for ( ;start < end; start++) {\n        final byte currentByte = buffer[start];\n        // CheckStyle:MagicNumber OFF\n        if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7'){\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n                    exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, start, currentByte));\n        }\n        result = (result << 3) + (currentByte - '0'); // convert from ASCII\n        // CheckStyle:MagicNumber ON\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\nWe need to modify the loop to include the overflow check.\n\nSo, inside the for loop:\n\nfor (; start < end; start++) {\n    final byte currentByte = buffer[start];\n    if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n                exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, start, currentByte));\n    }\n    long digit = currentByte - '0';\n    if (result > (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Octal value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE\");\n    }\n    result = result * 8 + digit;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's using result << 3, which is equivalent to *8. So, perhaps it's better to compute it as result * 8 + digit, which is clearer.\n\nAlternatively, keep the shift but compute the check accordingly.\n\nBut in any case, the key is to add the overflow check.\n\nAnother thing: the initial check if (buffer[start] == 0) returns 0. But what if the buffer is \"0\" followed by other digits? For example, \"0123\". The function would return 0, which is incorrect. Wait, no, because the length is at least 2. So, for example, if the buffer is \"00\", the function returns 0, which is correct. But if it's \"01\", it should return 1. But according to the code, if buffer[start] is 0, it returns 0. So that's a bug.\n\nWait, that's another issue. The code has:\n\nif (buffer[start] == 0) {\n    return 0L;\n}\n\nBut that's incorrect because the buffer could have leading zeros followed by other digits. For example, \"0123\" is a valid octal number, equal to 83 in decimal. But the function would return 0 because the first byte is 0.\n\nSo, that's another bug. The function incorrectly returns 0 when the first byte is 0, without considering the rest of the digits.\n\nSo, that's another issue to fix.\n\nSo, the function should not return 0 just because the first byte is 0. It should process all the digits.\n\nSo, that part of the code is incorrect and needs to be removed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Remove the check if (buffer[start] == 0) and returning 0.\n\nBecause that's incorrect. For example, the buffer could be \"0123\", which is 83 in decimal, but the function would return 0.\n\nSo, that's a bug that needs to be fixed.\n\nSo, the corrected code should not have that check.\n\nSo, the function should process all the digits, including leading zeros.\n\nSo, the code after the trimming steps should directly go into the loop.\n\nSo, the corrected code would remove the lines:\n\nif (buffer[start] == 0) {\n    return 0L;\n}\n\nSo, that's another change.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the corrected function would:\n\n- Remove the incorrect check for buffer[start] == 0.\n\n- In the loop, after checking each digit is valid, check for overflow before updating the result.\n\nSo, the final code would look like:\n\npublic static long parseOctal(final byte[] buffer, final int offset, final int length) {\n    long result = 0;\n    int end = offset + length;\n    int start = offset;\n\n    if (length < 2) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Length \" + length + \" must be at least 2\");\n    }\n\n    // Skip leading spaces\n    while (start < end) {\n        if (buffer[start] == ' ') {\n            start++;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Trim all trailing NULs and spaces.\n    byte trailer = buffer[end - 1];\n    if (trailer == 0 || trailer == ' ') {\n        end--;\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n                exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, end - 1, trailer));\n    }\n    trailer = buffer[end - 1];\n    while (start < end - 1 && (trailer == 0 || trailer == ' ')) {\n        end--;\n        trailer = buffer[end - 1];\n    }\n\n    for (; start < end; start++) {\n        final byte currentByte = buffer[start];\n        if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n                    exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, start, currentByte));\n        }\n        long digit = currentByte - '0';\n        if (result > (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Octal value exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE\");\n        }\n        result = result * 8 + digit;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the loop uses result << 3. So, perhaps it's better to compute it as result = (result << 3) + digit, but then check for overflow.\n\nBut wait, after shifting, adding the digit could cause overflow. So, perhaps the check should be done before the shift.\n\nWait, let's think: result is a long. After shifting left by 3 bits, it's multiplied by 8. Then adding the digit (0-7) could cause it to exceed Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, the maximum value before shifting is such that (result * 8 + digit) <= Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, the condition is:\n\nif (result > (Long.MAX_VALUE - digit) / 8) {\n    throw exception;\n}\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, the code remains as above.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when the buffer is empty after trimming. For example, if the buffer is all spaces. But the function requires length >=2, so perhaps that's handled.\n\nWait, the function trims trailing NULs and spaces, but after that, if start >= end, that would mean there are no digits left. So, in that case, the function would return 0. But according to the original code, if the buffer is all spaces, it would have start = offset, and after trimming, end could be less than start, leading to the loop not executing, and result remains 0.\n\nBut according to the function's contract, is that acceptable? For example, if the buffer is \"  \" (two spaces), the function would return 0. Is that correct?\n\nIn the context of parsing octal numbers, leading and trailing spaces are allowed, but the actual number must be present. So, if after trimming, there are no digits, perhaps the function should throw an exception",
