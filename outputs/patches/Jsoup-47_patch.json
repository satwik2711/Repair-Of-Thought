      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the escape function where it's not correctly handling the '>' character in XML attribute values. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe root cause is that when the function encounters a '>', it doesn't append '&gt;' if it's inside an XML attribute. Looking at the original code, in the switch statement, when the character is '>', it checks if inAttribute is false. If so, it appends '&gt;', else it appends the character. But according to the problem, this isn't handling the case correctly for XML attributes.\n\nWait, the original code for '>' is:\ncase '>':\n    if (!inAttribute)\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    else\n        accum.append(c);\n    break;\n\nSo, when inAttribute is true, it appends '>' as is, which is incorrect for XML attributes. Because in XML attributes, '>' should be escaped as '&gt;'. But in HTML attributes, maybe it's different? Hmm, but the problem states that the function isn't appending '&gt;' when it should in XML attributes.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code doesn't consider the escapeMode. The suggestion says to add a separate check for '>' after the switch. So maybe the switch isn't handling it correctly, and we need an additional condition.\n\nLooking at the suggestion, it adds an if statement after the switch. So the idea is that after handling the switch cases, we check if the character is '>', and then decide whether to escape it based on inAttribute and escapeMode.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the '>' is already handled in the switch. So perhaps the problem is that in some cases, like when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not xhtml, it's not escaping '>'.\n\nWait, the original code for '>' in the switch appends '&'gt; only if not inAttribute. So when inAttribute is true, it appends '>' as is. But according to XML standards, in attribute values, '>' should be escaped. So the original code is incorrect in that scenario.\n\nSo the fix is to change the handling of '>' so that when inAttribute is true, it appends '&gt;' only if escapeMode is not xhtml? Or wait, the suggestion says to add a separate check after the switch.\n\nWait, the suggestion code is:\n\nif (c == '>') {\n    if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    else\n        accum.append(c);\n}\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think about it.\n\nIn XML, attribute values require certain characters to be escaped. For example, in XML attributes, both '<' and '>' should be escaped. But in HTML attributes, some characters don't need to be escaped unless they're inside a context where they could break the markup.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the original code, when inAttribute is true, '>' is not being escaped. So the function is appending '>' as is, which is incorrect for XML attributes.\n\nSo the fix is to ensure that when inAttribute is true, '>' is escaped to '&gt;' unless in a specific mode where it's not needed.\n\nLooking back at the suggestion, it adds a separate check after the switch. So perhaps the original code misses some cases where '>' needs to be escaped, especially when inAttribute is true.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the '>' is handled in the switch. So maybe the problem is that the switch doesn't account for the escapeMode correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the switch is handling '>' correctly in some cases, but not all. So adding an additional check outside the switch would cover all cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's handling of '>' is incorrect when inAttribute is true. Because in XML attributes, '>' should always be escaped. So in the original code, when inAttribute is true, it appends '>' as is, which is wrong.\n\nSo the correct behavior should be: in XML attributes, '>' should be escaped to '&gt;', regardless of the escapeMode. Or perhaps it depends on the escapeMode.\n\nWait, the escapeMode could be xhtml or html. In XHTML, all special characters in attributes must be escaped. In HTML, some can be left as is.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is: when inAttribute is true, escape '>' to '&gt;' only if escapeMode is xhtml or if it's required by XML.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. The problem states that the function isn't appending '&gt;' when it should in XML attribute values.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the handling of '>' so that when inAttribute is true, it appends '&gt;' unless in a certain mode.\n\nLooking at the suggestion, it adds an if statement after the switch. So the code would first go through the switch, which handles some cases, and then this additional check would handle others.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the '>' is already handled in the switch. So adding another check might cause issues. Alternatively, perhaps the switch isn't handling all cases correctly, so moving the '>' handling outside would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's handling of '>' is incorrect, and the fix is to adjust the condition in the switch.\n\nLet me think about the correct behavior:\n\nIn XML, attribute values can be enclosed in single or double quotes. The characters that need to be escaped are:\n\n- The quote character used to delimit the attribute must be escaped (e.g., \" becomes &quot;).\n- The ampersand (&) must be escaped as &amp;.\n- The less-than (<) and greater-than (>) characters should be escaped as &lt; and &gt; respectively, especially if they could interfere with the XML structure.\n\nIn HTML, the rules are more lenient. For example, in HTML attributes, you can have unescaped '>' as long as it doesn't close the tag prematurely.\n\nSo, in the context of this function, when inAttribute is true, the function should escape '>' to '&gt;' if the escapeMode requires it. For example, in XHTML (which is XML), it's necessary, but in HTML, it might not be.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the function isn't correctly handling '>' in XML attribute values. So perhaps the function is treating it as HTML when it should be treating it as XML.\n\nSo, the original code in the switch for '>' is:\n\nif (!inAttribute)\n    append \"&gt;\"\nelse\n    append c\n\nWhich means, when inAttribute is true, it appends '>' as is. But in XML attributes, '>' should be escaped. So this is incorrect.\n\nSo the fix is to change the condition so that when inAttribute is true, '>' is escaped.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the escapeMode comes into play. For example, in XHTML mode, it should be escaped, but in HTML mode, maybe not.\n\nSo, the correct condition would be: if inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XHTML, then escape '>'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should always escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of the mode, because in XML attributes, it's required.\n\nWait, but the problem's suggestion adds a separate check after the switch. So perhaps the approach is to handle '>' in the switch for some cases, and then have an additional check for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's handling of '>' is incorrect, and the fix is to adjust the condition in the switch.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the case for '>' in the switch to append '&gt;' when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not HTML, or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should escape '>' when inAttribute is true and the escapeMode is XHTML, or when not inAttribute.\n\nAlternatively, the function should escape '>' in all cases except when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is HTML.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the suggestion again.\n\nThe suggestion is to add a separate check for '>' after the switch. The code is:\n\nif (c == '>') {\n    if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    else\n        accum.append(c);\n}\n\nWait, but in this code, if c is '>', then:\n\n- If not inAttribute, or escapeMode is xhtml, then append '&gt;'.\n- Else, append '>'.\n\nSo, when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not xhtml, it appends '>'.\n\nHmm, that might not be correct for XML attributes. Because in XML, even if escapeMode is not xhtml, if you're in an attribute, '>' should be escaped.\n\nWait, perhaps the escapeMode determines whether to use HTML or XML escaping rules. So, in XML mode, all necessary characters are escaped, including '>' in attributes.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct condition is: when inAttribute is true, escape '>' to '&gt;' if escapeMode is XML.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should always escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of the mode, because XML requires it.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the original function's behavior.\n\nIn the original code, for '>', it appends '&gt;' only when not inAttribute. So when inAttribute is true, it appends '>'.\n\nBut according to the problem, this is incorrect because in XML attributes, '>' should be escaped.\n\nSo, the fix is to change the condition so that when inAttribute is true, '>' is escaped.\n\nBut how does escapeMode affect this?\n\nLooking at the original code, for the '<' character, it appends '&lt;' only when not inAttribute. So in attributes, it appends '<' as is. But that's incorrect for XML attributes.\n\nWait, no, in XML attributes, '<' must be escaped as '&lt;', regardless of whether it's in an attribute or not. So the original code is incorrect for both '<' and '>'.\n\nWait, but the problem specifically mentions '>' not being handled correctly. So perhaps the function is correct for '<' but not for '>'.\n\nWait, in the original code, for '<', it appends '&lt;' when not inAttribute, else appends '<'. That's incorrect because in XML attributes, '<' should always be escaped.\n\nSo, perhaps the function has a similar issue with '<' as it does with '>', but the problem only points out '>'.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix should also handle '<' correctly, but the problem only focuses on '>'.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, I should focus on the provided fix suggestion, which is to add a separate check for '>'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Keep the existing switch statement as is, but then add an additional check for '>' after the switch.\n\nWait, but in the switch, '>' is already handled. So adding another check might cause issues, like double-escaping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the switch should not handle '>' and the additional check should take care of it.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the switch's handling of '>' is incorrect, and the additional check is needed to correct it.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's handling of '>' is incorrect, and the additional check will override it.\n\nBut that could be problematic because the code after the switch would process the same character again.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the switch's handling of '>'.\n\nLet me think: in the switch, for '>', the code appends '&gt;' if not inAttribute, else appends '>'.\n\nBut according to XML rules, when inAttribute is true, '>' should be escaped.\n\nSo, the condition should be: if inAttribute is true, append '&gt;', else append '>'.\n\nWait, no, because in HTML attributes, '>' might not need to be escaped.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct condition is: if inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XML, then escape '>'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should always escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of the mode.\n\nWait, but the escapeMode could be HTML or XHTML. In HTML, maybe '>' in attributes doesn't need to be escaped, but in XHTML (which is XML), it does.\n\nSo, the correct condition would be: if inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XHTML, then escape '>'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should escape '>' in attributes only when escapeMode is XHTML.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me look at the suggestion again.\n\nThe suggestion adds an if statement after the switch:\n\nif (c == '>') {\n    if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    else\n        accum.append(c);\n}\n\nSo, in this code:\n\n- If the character is '>', then:\n   - If not inAttribute OR escapeMode is XHTML: append '&gt;'\n   - Else: append '>'\n\nSo, when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not XHTML, it appends '>'.\n\nBut according to XML standards, in attributes, '>' should be escaped regardless of the mode. So perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the escapeMode determines whether to use XML or HTML escaping rules. So, in XHTML mode, it's XML, and in HTML mode, it's HTML.\n\nSo, in XML mode (XHTML), '>' in attributes should be escaped. In HTML mode, perhaps it's not necessary.\n\nSo, the suggestion's condition makes sense: when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not XHTML, then '>' is not escaped.\n\nBut according to the problem, the function isn't correctly handling '>' in XML attributes, implying that it should be escaped.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to escape '>' when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XHTML.\n\nWait, but the suggestion's condition is: if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == XHTML), then escape.\n\nSo, when inAttribute is true, it only escapes if escapeMode is XHTML.\n\nWhich aligns with the idea that in XML (XHTML) attributes, '>' is escaped, but in HTML attributes, it's not.\n\nSo, the function should append '&gt;' when:\n\n- Not inAttribute (so in text content), or\n- InAttribute and escapeMode is XHTML.\n\nOtherwise, append '>'.\n\nSo, the suggestion's code correctly implements this.\n\nBut in the original code, the '>' is handled in the switch, which appends '&gt;' only when not inAttribute. So, when inAttribute is true, it appends '>'.\n\nWhich is incorrect for XML attributes.\n\nSo, the fix is to add this additional check after the switch, which will handle the '>' correctly.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the '>' is already handled in the switch. So, after the switch, the code would have already appended either '&gt;' or '>', depending on inAttribute.\n\nThen, the additional check would run, and since c is '>', it would execute the if block again, potentially appending another '&gt;' or '>'.\n\nThat would be a problem because it would cause the character to be processed twice.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to remove the handling of '>' from the switch and handle it entirely in the additional check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the switch should not handle '>' at all, and the additional check should take care of it.\n\nBut that might complicate things because the switch is handling other characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the switch's handling of '>' is incorrect, and the additional check is needed to correct it.\n\nWait, perhaps the switch's handling of '>' is only correct in some cases, and the additional check is needed to cover other cases.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the flow.\n\nIn the original code, for each character, it goes into the switch if it's a single char code point. So, for '>', it's handled in the switch.\n\nAfter that, the code proceeds to the other handling for supplementary characters.\n\nSo, adding an if statement after the switch would cause the code to process '>' again, which is not correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the switch's handling of '>'.\n\nSo, in the switch, for '>', instead of checking if inAttribute is false, we should check whether to escape based on inAttribute and escapeMode.\n\nSo, the modified case for '>' would be:\n\ncase '>':\n    if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml) {\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    } else {\n        accum.append(c);\n    }\n    break;\n\nThis way, when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not XHTML, '>' is not escaped. But according to XML standards, in XML attributes, '>' should be escaped regardless of the mode.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the escapeMode. Maybe in XHTML mode, it's stricter about escaping.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should always escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of escapeMode.\n\nBut according to the problem, the function isn't appending '&gt;' when it should in XML attributes, implying that the current code doesn't do that.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct condition is to escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of escapeMode.\n\nIn that case, the case for '>' in the switch should be:\n\ncase '>':\n    if (inAttribute) {\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    } else {\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    }\n    break;\n\nWait, no, that would always append '&gt;' regardless of context, which is incorrect because in text content, '>' should be escaped as '&gt;' only if it's not in a context where it's allowed.\n\nWait, no, in text content, '>' doesn't need to be escaped unless it's part of a CDATA section or something. Wait, no, in XML and HTML, '>' in text content is allowed and doesn't need to be escaped. Wait, no, actually, in XML, '>' in text content is allowed, but in HTML, it's also allowed. So, the only place where '>' needs to be escaped is in attributes (for XML) or in certain contexts.\n\nWait, no, in XML, '>' in text content is fine. It's only in attributes that it needs to be escaped if it's not part of the attribute value delimiters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nIn XML:\n\n- In text content (between tags), characters like '<' and '>' do not need to be escaped unless they form part of a CDATA section or are part of a markup construct, which is rare.\n\n- In attribute values, certain characters must be escaped. For example, if the attribute is enclosed in double quotes, the double quote must be escaped, and '<' and '>' should be escaped to prevent XML parsing errors.\n\nIn HTML:\n\n- Similar rules apply, but HTML is more lenient. For example, in attribute values, unescaped '<' or '>' might not break the parser as long as they don't form invalid tag structures.\n\nSo, in the context of this function, when inAttribute is true, '>' should be escaped to '&gt;' if the escapeMode is XML or XHTML, but perhaps not in HTML mode.\n\nSo, the correct condition is: when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not HTML, escape '>'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should always escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of the mode.\n\nBut according to the problem, the function isn't appending '&gt;' when it should in XML attributes, so perhaps the function is in HTML mode when it should be in XML mode.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the condition in the switch for '>' to check if inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XML, then escape.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to proceed.\n\nThe original code in the switch for '>' is:\n\ncase '>':\n    if (!inAttribute)\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    else\n        accum.append(c);\n    break;\n\nWhich means, when inAttribute is true, '>' is not escaped. Which is incorrect for XML attributes.\n\nSo, the fix is to change this condition to escape '>' when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XML.\n\nSo, the modified case would be:\n\ncase '>':\n    if (!inAttribute || (inAttribute && escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)) {\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    } else {\n        accum.append(c);\n    }\n    break;\n\nWait, no, that would append '&gt;' when not inAttribute OR when inAttribute and escapeMode is xhtml. So, in HTML mode, when inAttribute is true, it appends '>'.\n\nWhich aligns with the suggestion provided.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to modify the switch's handling of '>' to include the escapeMode check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the switch should not handle '>' and the additional check should be added after the switch.\n\nBut that would cause the code to process '>' twice, which is not correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the switch's case for '>'.\n\nSo, in the switch, for '>', the code becomes:\n\ncase '>':\n    if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml) {\n        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n    } else {\n        accum.append(c);\n    }\n    break;\n\nThis way, when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is not XHTML, '>' is not escaped, which is correct for HTML attributes but incorrect for XML attributes.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the function isn't correctly handling XML attributes, implying that in XML attributes, '>' should be escaped.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be: if inAttribute is true, then escape '>' only if escapeMode is XHTML.\n\nWhich is what the modified code does.\n\nSo, with this change, when inAttribute is true and escapeMode is XHTML, '>' is escaped. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nWhich should fix the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should always escape '>' when inAttribute is true, regardless of escapeMode.\n\nBut according to the problem's suggestion, the additional check uses the condition (!inAttribute || escapeMode == XHTML).\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the switch's case for '>' to include this condition.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the modified function would have the switch case for '>' updated as per the condition.\n\nThus, the fixed function would have the case '>': modified to check both inAttribute and escapeMode.\n\nSo, I'll proceed to write the fixed function with this change.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where the function does not correctly escape the '>' character in XML attribute values, we need to adjust the condition that determines whether to escape '>'. The escape should occur when either not in an attribute or when in an attribute and the escape mode is XHTML.\n\n```java\nstatic void escape(StringBuilder accum, String string, Document.OutputSettings out,\n                   boolean inAttribute, boolean normaliseWhite, boolean stripLeadingWhite) {\n\n    boolean lastWasWhite = false;\n    boolean reachedNonWhite = false;\n    final EscapeMode escapeMode = out.escapeMode();\n    final CharsetEncoder encoder = out.encoder();\n    final CoreCharset coreCharset = CoreCharset.byName(encoder.charset().name());\n    final Map<Character, String> map = escapeMode.getMap();\n    final int length = string.length();\n\n    int codePoint;\n    for (int offset = 0; offset < length; offset += Character.charCount(codePoint)) {\n        codePoint = string.codePointAt(offset);\n\n        if (normaliseWhite) {\n            if (StringUtil.isWhitespace(codePoint)) {\n                if ((stripLeadingWhite && !reachedNonWhite) || lastWasWhite)\n                    continue;\n                accum.append(' ');\n                lastWasWhite = true;\n                continue;\n            } else {\n                lastWasWhite = false;\n                reachedNonWhite = true;\n            }\n        }\n        // surrogate pairs, split implementation for efficiency on single char common case (saves creating strings, char[]):\n        if (codePoint < Character.MIN_SUPPLEMENTARY_CODE_POINT) {\n            final char c = (char) codePoint;\n            // html specific and required escapes:\n            switch (c) {\n                case '&':\n                    accum.append(\"&amp;\");\n                    break;\n                case 0xA0:\n                    if (escapeMode != EscapeMode.xhtml)\n                        accum.append(\"&nbsp;\");\n                    else\n                        accum.append(\"&#xa0;\");\n                    break;\n                case '<':\n                    // escape when in character data or when in a xml attribute val; not needed in html attr val\n                    if (!inAttribute)\n                        accum.append(\"&lt;\");\n                    else\n                        accum.append(c);\n                    break;\n                case '>':\n                    if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)\n                        accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n                    else\n                        accum.append(c);\n                    break;\n                case '\"':\n                    if (inAttribute)\n                        accum.append(\"&quot;\");\n                    else\n                        accum.append(c);\n                    break;\n                default:\n                    if (canEncode(coreCharset, c, encoder))\n                        accum.append(c);",
