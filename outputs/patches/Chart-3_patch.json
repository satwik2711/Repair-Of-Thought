Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `createCopy` method is not correctly handling the end index when copying data points from the original series. The method is currently copying data points from the start index to the end index inclusive, which is not the expected behavior. The method should copy data points from the start index to the end index exclusive.\nSuggestion: Modify Loop Condition\nOne possible fix is to modify the loop condition in the `createCopy` method to `index < end` instead of `index <= end`. This will ensure that the method only copies data points up to but not including the end index. This fix is simple and effective, and it ensures that the method behaves as expected.\n// Buggy Function\npublic TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)\n        throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    if (start < 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start >= 0.\");\n    }\n    if (end < start) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start <= end.\");\n    }\n    TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();\n    copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList();\n    if (this.data.size() > 0) {\n        for (int index = start; index <= end; index++) {\n            TimeSeriesDataItem item\n                    = (TimeSeriesDataItem) this.data.get(index);\n            TimeSeriesDataItem clone = (TimeSeriesDataItem) item.clone();\n            try {\n                copy.add(clone);\n            }\n            catch (SeriesException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return copy;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The method is currently copying data points from the start index to the end index inclusive, which is not the expected behavior. The method should copy data points from the start index to the end index exclusive.\nSuggestion: Adjust End Index\nAnother possible fix is to adjust the end index in the `createCopy` method by subtracting 1 from it before the loop. This will ensure that the method only copies data points up to but not including the end index. This fix is also simple and effective, but it may be less intuitive than modifying the loop condition.\n// Buggy Function\npublic TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)\n        throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    if (start < 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start >= 0.\");\n    }\n    if (end < start) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start <= end.\");\n    }\n    TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();\n    copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList();\n    if (this.data.size() > 0) {\n        for (int index = start; index <= end; index++) {\n            TimeSeriesDataItem item\n                    = (TimeSeriesDataItem) this.data.get(index);\n            TimeSeriesDataItem clone = (TimeSeriesDataItem) item.clone();\n            try {\n                copy.add(clone);\n            }\n            catch (SeriesException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return copy;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The method is currently copying data points from the start index to the end index inclusive, which is not the expected behavior. The method should copy data points from the start index to the end index exclusive.\nSuggestion: Use SubList\nA third possible fix is to use the `subList` method of the `ArrayList` class to copy the data points from the original series. This method allows us to specify the start and end indices of the sublist to be copied, and it will automatically handle the end index correctly. This fix is more elegant and efficient than the other two suggestions, but it may require additional error handling to ensure that the sublist is correctly copied.\n// Buggy Function\npublic TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)\n        throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    if (start < 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start >= 0.\");\n    }\n    if (end < start) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Requires start <= end.\");\n    }\n    TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();\n    copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList();\n    if (this.data.size() > 0) {\n        for (int index = start; index <= end; index++) {\n            TimeSeriesDataItem item\n                    = (TimeSeriesDataItem) this.data.get(index);\n            TimeSeriesDataItem clone = (TimeSeriesDataItem) item.clone();\n            try {\n                copy.add(clone);\n            }\n            catch (SeriesException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return copy;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
