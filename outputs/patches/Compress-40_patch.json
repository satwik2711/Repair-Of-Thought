      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this buggy function. Let me read through the problem and understand what's going on.\n\nThe function is called readBits and it's supposed to read a certain number of bits from an input stream. The issue is with the variable bitsCachedSize. When it's 57 or more, left-shifting it by 8 bits causes an overflow. That's because in Java, a long is 64 bits, so shifting 57 by 8 gives 65, which is beyond the capacity, leading to incorrect values in bitsCached.\n\nLooking at the code, the problem occurs in the else block where bitsCached is shifted left by 8 bits. So, when bitsCachedSize is >=57, doing bitsCached <<=8 will cause an overflow.\n\nThe suggestion is to add a check before shifting. If bitsCachedSize is >=57, we should handle it to prevent overflow. Maybe reset bitsCachedSize and bitsCached to 0 in that case.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. So, before the else block where the shifting happens, I should add a condition. If bitsCachedSize is >=57, then set bitsCachedSize to 0 and bitsCached to 0. That way, when we proceed, we don't overflow.\n\nWait, but what if bitsCachedSize is exactly 57? Shifting by 8 would make it 65, which is beyond 64 bits. So, any bitsCachedSize >=57 before shifting would cause an overflow. So, the condition should check if bitsCachedSize +8 > 64? Or maybe just bitsCachedSize >= (64 -7) since shifting 8 bits when size is 57 would make it 65.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be if (bitsCachedSize >= (64 - 8 +1)) which is 57. So, if bitsCachedSize >=57, then we can't shift anymore without overflowing.\n\nSo, in the else block, before doing bitsCached <<=8, I should check if bitsCachedSize is >=57. If yes, then set bitsCachedSize to 0 and bitsCached to 0. Otherwise, proceed with shifting.\n\nWait, but in the else block, the code is:\n\nbitsCached <<=8;\nbitsCached |= nextByte;\n\nSo, the shifting is done before OR-ing the nextByte. So, if bitsCachedSize is 57, shifting by 8 would make it 65, which is beyond the 64-bit long. So, the overflow happens here.\n\nSo, the fix is to add a check before this shifting. So, inside the else block, before shifting, check if bitsCachedSize >=57. If so, reset bitsCachedSize to 0 and bitsCached to 0. Then, after that, proceed with the shifting and OR-ing.\n\nWait, but after resetting, when we do bitsCached <<=8, bitsCached is 0, so shifting does nothing. Then, OR with nextByte would set bitsCached to nextByte. But then bitsCachedSize would be incremented by 8, making it 8. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nIn the else block:\n\nif (bitsCachedSize >=57) {\n    bitsCached = 0;\n    bitsCachedSize = 0;\n}\nbitsCached <<=8;\nbitsCached |= nextByte;\nbitsCachedSize +=8;\n\nWait, but what if bitsCachedSize is 56? Then, after shifting, it becomes 64, which is okay. But if it's 57, shifting would make 65, which is bad. So, the condition is correct.\n\nSo, I need to add this condition inside the else block, right before the shifting.\n\nLet me look at the code structure. The else is inside the while loop. So, each time we read a byte, we check if we need to handle overflow.\n\nSo, the modified else block would be:\n\nelse {\n    if (bitsCachedSize >=57) {\n        bitsCached = 0;\n        bitsCachedSize = 0;\n    }\n    bitsCached <<=8;\n    bitsCached |= nextByte;\n    bitsCachedSize +=8;\n}\n\nWait, but what about when bitsCachedSize is 56? After shifting, it becomes 64, which is okay. Then, adding 8 makes it 64, which is still okay because 64 is the maximum size of a long (since it's 64 bits). Wait, no, 64 bits would mean bitsCachedSize can be up to 64. But when you shift a long by 64, it's undefined behavior in Java, but actually, shifting a long by 64 is the same as shifting by 0 because it's modulo 64. So, shifting by 64 is 0, which is not correct.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Java, when you shift a long by a value >=64, it's the same as shifting by (value % 64). So, shifting by 64 is the same as shifting by 0. So, if bitsCachedSize is 56, and we shift by 8, making it 64. Then, bitsCachedSize becomes 64. Next time, if we try to shift again, it would be 64, which modulo 64 is 0, so no shift. But that's a problem because we're trying to read more bits than available.\n\nWait, but the loop condition is while (bitsCachedSize < count). So, if count is, say, 65, which is more than MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, but the function already checks if count is greater than MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. Wait, looking back, the function starts with:\n\nif (count <0 || count> MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) throw...\n\nSo, the maximum count is MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which I assume is 64 or less. So, the function is designed to handle up to 64 bits.\n\nWait, but in the code, the bitsCachedSize can go up to 64, but when you have bitsCachedSize=56, and you read another byte, you shift by 8, making bitsCachedSize 64. Then, when you try to read another byte, the loop condition is bitsCachedSize < count. If count is 64, then bitsCachedSize is 64, so the loop doesn't run. Then, the code proceeds to extract the bits.\n\nBut if count is 64, then in the else block, after the loop, the code does:\n\nbitsOut = (bitsCached >> (bitsCachedSize - count)) & MASKS[count];\n\nSince bitsCachedSize is 64 and count is 64, bitsCached >> 0, so bitsOut is bitsCached & MASKS[64]. But MASKS[64] is probably 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFL, so it's fine.\n\nWait, but what if count is 64 and bitsCachedSize is 64? Then, after extracting, bitsCachedSize is reduced by count, making it 0. So, that's correct.\n\nBut what about when bitsCachedSize is 64 and we try to read another byte? Because the loop condition is bitsCachedSize < count. So, if count is 64, and bitsCachedSize is 64, the loop doesn't run. So, no problem.\n\nBut the issue is when bitsCachedSize is 57 or more before shifting. So, the fix is to add the condition in the else block before shifting.\n\nSo, the code in the else block becomes:\n\nelse {\n    if (bitsCachedSize >=57) {\n        bitsCached = 0;\n        bitsCachedSize = 0;\n    }\n    bitsCached <<=8;\n    bitsCached |= nextByte;\n    bitsCachedSize +=8;\n}\n\nWait, but what if bitsCachedSize is 57, and we reset it to 0, then shift by 8, making it 8. Then, add the next byte. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we reset to 0, then the nextByte is OR-ed after shifting. So, the nextByte becomes the first 8 bits of bitsCached, which is correct.\n\nBut what about the data that was previously in bitsCached? If we reset it, we lose that data. But that's because when bitsCachedSize is 57, we can't read another byte without overflowing. So, perhaps the function should not allow reading beyond 64 bits, but the function is already guarded by the initial check.\n\nWait, the function starts with:\n\nif (count <0 || count> MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\n\nSo, the maximum count is MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. Let's assume that's 64. So, the function is supposed to handle up to 64 bits. So, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we read another byte, we have to make sure that we don't overflow.\n\nBut in the current code, without the fix, when bitsCachedSize is 57, shifting by 8 makes it 65, which is beyond 64 bits, causing the overflow.\n\nSo, the fix is to check if bitsCachedSize is >=57 before shifting. If so, reset bitsCached and bitsCachedSize to 0. Then, proceed to shift and add the next byte.\n\nWait, but after resetting, the bitsCachedSize becomes 0, and then we shift by 8, making it 8. Then, add the next byte. So, the nextByte is in the higher bits now.\n\nBut what about the previous data? Because when we reset bitsCached to 0, we lose all the previously cached bits. That might cause data loss.\n\nWait, but in the scenario where bitsCachedSize is 57, and we're trying to read another 8 bits, the total would be 65, which is more than 64. So, the function can't handle that because the maximum count is 64. So, perhaps the function should not allow reading more than 64 bits. But the initial check is on the count, not on the bitsCachedSize.\n\nWait, but the function is designed to read 'count' bits, which can be up to MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is probably 64. So, when the function is called with count=64, it's supposed to read exactly 64 bits.\n\nSo, in the case where bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, the loop will run again because 57 <64. So, it reads another byte, and then in the else block, we check if bitsCachedSize >=57. Since it's 57, we reset bitsCached and bitsCachedSize to 0. Then, we shift by 8, making bitsCachedSize 8, and OR the nextByte. Now, bitsCachedSize is 8, which is less than 64, so the loop will run again, reading another byte. But wait, count is 64, so the loop will run until bitsCachedSize is >=64.\n\nWait, but after resetting, bitsCachedSize is 0, then after reading one byte, it's 8. Then, the loop will continue because 8 <64. So, it will read 8 more bytes, each time adding 8 to bitsCachedSize, until it reaches 64.\n\nWait, but that would require reading 8 more bytes, which is 64 bits. But the initial count is 64, so that's correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: initial bitsCachedSize is 57, count is 64. So, 57 <64, so loop runs. Read nextByte, which is 8 bits. Now, in the else block, since bitsCachedSize is 57 >=57, reset to 0. Then, shift 0 by 8, which is 0, OR nextByte, so bitsCached is nextByte. bitsCachedSize becomes 8.\n\nNow, the loop condition is 8 <64, so loop runs again. Read another byte. Now, bitsCachedSize is 8 <57? No, so no reset. Shift bitsCached (which is nextByte) by 8, then OR with new nextByte. bitsCachedSize becomes 16.\n\nThis continues until bitsCachedSize reaches 64. So, after 8 iterations (each adding 8), it will reach 64.\n\nWait, but 8 *8 is 64, so 8 iterations. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the initial bitsCachedSize was 57, and after resetting, it's 0, then after 8 reads, it's 64. So, the total bits read are 57 (before) + 8*8=64, but that's 57+64=121, which is more than 64. That can't be right.\n\nWait, no. Because after resetting, the previous 57 bits are lost. So, the function is only returning the last 64 bits read. But that's not correct because the function is supposed to return 'count' bits, which is 64, but the way it's being handled now, it's losing the earlier 57 bits.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the function is supposed to accumulate bits until it has 'count' bits, but when it overflows, it's discarding the earlier bits, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach of resetting is not correct. Maybe we need a different way to handle the overflow.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of resetting, when bitsCachedSize +8 would exceed 64, we can extract the necessary bits and then reset.\n\nWait, but how? Because the function is supposed to return exactly 'count' bits. So, if count is 64, and bitsCachedSize is 57, we need to read 7 more bits. But each read is in bytes, which are 8 bits. So, perhaps the function can't handle cases where count is not a multiple of 8? Or maybe it can, but the current implementation is designed to handle any count up to 64.\n\nWait, looking back, the function is supposed to read 'count' bits, which can be any number, not necessarily a multiple of 8. So, the function reads bytes, accumulates them into bitsCached, and when enough bits are accumulated, it extracts the required count.\n\nSo, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, the function needs to read 7 more bits. But since each read is a byte (8 bits), it will read a byte, but only use the first 7 bits, and discard the 8th.\n\nWait, but in the current code, it's not handling that. So, perhaps the bug is more complex.\n\nBut the original problem is that when bitsCachedSize is >=57, shifting by 8 causes overflow. So, the initial fix is to prevent that overflow by checking before shifting.\n\nBut the way I suggested earlier, resetting bitsCached and bitsCachedSize, causes data loss. So, perhaps a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternative idea: When bitsCachedSize is >=57, we can't read another full byte without overflowing. So, perhaps in that case, we should read only the necessary bits to reach 'count' without overflowing.\n\nWait, but how? Because each read is a byte, which is 8 bits. So, if we need to read 7 more bits, but the next read is 8 bits, we can take only the first 7 bits and ignore the 8th.\n\nBut that complicates the code. Alternatively, perhaps the function should not allow reading more than 64 bits, but the initial check is already in place.\n\nWait, the function starts with:\n\nif (count <0 || count> MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(...);\n}\n\nSo, if MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE is 64, then count can't be more than 64. So, the function is supposed to handle up to 64 bits.\n\nSo, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, the loop will run again because 57 <64. So, it reads another byte, which is 8 bits, making bitsCachedSize 65, which overflows.\n\nSo, the solution is to prevent the overflow by checking before shifting.\n\nBut how to handle the case where bitsCachedSize +8 exceeds 64.\n\nWait, perhaps when bitsCachedSize >= (64 -8 +1) =57, we can't read another full byte. So, in that case, we can read the remaining bits needed without causing overflow.\n\nBut since each read is a byte, which is 8 bits, perhaps the function can't handle cases where count is not a multiple of 8 beyond 57.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not allow count to be more than 64, which it already does, but the shifting needs to be handled correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate how many more bits we can read without overflowing, read that many bits, and then stop.\n\nBut that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not allow the bitsCachedSize to exceed 64. So, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we need to read another 7 bits, but since each read is 8 bits, perhaps we can read the 8 bits, but only take the first 7 and discard the 8th.\n\nBut that would require modifying the code to handle partial bytes.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the initial fix of resetting is acceptable, but it may not handle all cases correctly.\n\nWait, but in the original code, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we read another byte, shifting causes overflow. So, the function returns incorrect data.\n\nThe suggested fix is to reset bitsCached and bitsCachedSize when bitsCachedSize >=57 before shifting. But that causes data loss.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when bitsCachedSize is >=57, we can extract the necessary bits and then reset.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to return 'count' bits. So, perhaps when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, we can take the 57 bits, read one more byte, take 7 bits from it, and then have 64 bits total.\n\nBut that requires more complex handling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not allow bitsCachedSize to exceed 64. So, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we need to read 7 more bits, we can read a byte, shift it right by 1 (to get 7 bits), and then OR it with the existing bitsCached.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is designed to read bytes and accumulate them in bitsCached, and when enough bits are accumulated, extract the required count.\n\nSo, the problem is that when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we read another byte, shifting by 8 causes overflow.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to check if after shifting, the bitsCachedSize would exceed 64. If so, then we can't read another full byte. So, in that case, we should read only the necessary bits.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should limit the number of bits read to 64, to prevent overflow.\n\nBut the function is supposed to handle up to MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is 64.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to, when bitsCachedSize is >=57, read the remaining bits needed without causing overflow.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement that without complicating the code.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the initial fix of resetting is acceptable, but I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should never allow bitsCachedSize to exceed 64. So, in the else block, before shifting, check if bitsCachedSize +8 >64. If so, then we can't read another byte. So, perhaps we should break out of the loop and handle it.\n\nBut that would leave bitsCachedSize less than count, which would cause the function to not have enough bits, leading to incorrect results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should throw an exception if it can't read enough bits, but that's not the current behavior.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the initial fix is to add the condition to reset bitsCached and bitsCachedSize when bitsCachedSize >=57, as suggested.\n\nBut I'm concerned that this would cause data loss. For example, if bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, the function would reset, losing the 57 bits, and then read 8 more bits, making bitsCachedSize 8. Then, the loop would run again, reading another 56 bits (7 bytes), making bitsCachedSize 64. Then, the function returns the last 64 bits read, but the initial 57 are lost.\n\nThat's incorrect because the function should return the first 64 bits read, not the last 64.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of resetting, when bitsCachedSize is >=57, we can extract the necessary bits and then reset.\n\nWait, but how? Because the function is supposed to return 'count' bits, which may be more than the current bitsCachedSize.\n\nWait, perhaps when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, we need to read 7 more bits. But since each read is a byte, which is 8 bits, perhaps we can read the byte, take the first 7 bits, and then stop.\n\nBut that would require modifying the code to handle partial bytes.\n\nSo, perhaps in the else block, when bitsCachedSize >=57, we calculate how many more bits we need: remaining = count - bitsCachedSize.\n\nIf remaining <=8, then we can read one more byte, take the first 'remaining' bits, and then exit the loop.\n\nBut that's more complex.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nIn the else block:\n\n- Check if bitsCachedSize >=57.\n- If yes:\n   - Calculate remaining = count - bitsCachedSize.\n   - If remaining >8: this is impossible because count <=64, and bitsCachedSize >=57, so remaining <=7.\n   - Read the next byte.\n   - Take the first 'remaining' bits from the byte.\n   - OR them into bitsCached.\n   - Set bitsCachedSize += remaining.\n   - Break out of the loop because we have enough bits.\n- Else:\n   - Proceed with shifting and OR-ing the next byte.\n\nBut this requires adding this logic inside the else block.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nelse {\n    if (bitsCachedSize >=57) {\n        int remaining = count - bitsCachedSize;\n        if (remaining >0) {\n            long nextByte = in.read();\n            if (nextByte <0) {\n                return nextByte;\n            }\n            // Take the first 'remaining' bits from nextByte\n            nextByte = nextByte >> (8 - remaining);\n            bitsCached |= nextByte;\n            bitsCachedSize += remaining;\n        }\n        break; // Exit the loop as we have enough bits\n    } else {\n        bitsCached <<=8;\n        bitsCached |= nextByte;\n        bitsCachedSize +=8;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this is getting more involved. Also, the code is inside the else block, which is part of the while loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should be restructured to handle this case.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps the initial fix is to add the condition and reset, even though it may cause data loss, but according to the problem statement, that's the suggested fix.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with adding the condition in the else block.\n\nSo, the fixed function would have the else block modified as:\n\nelse {\n    if (bitsCachedSize >=57) {\n        bitsCached = 0;\n        bitsCachedSize = 0;\n    }\n    bitsCached <<=8;\n    bitsCached |= nextByte;\n    bitsCachedSize +=8;\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct, as it may cause data loss.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to check if after shifting, bitsCachedSize would exceed 64. So, if bitsCachedSize +8 >64, then we can't shift. So, in that case, we should read the necessary bits without shifting.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nelse {\n    if (bitsCachedSize +8 >64) {\n        // Not enough space to shift, read partial bits\n        int needed = count - bitsCachedSize;\n        if (needed <=0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        // Read the next byte\n        long nextByte = in.read();\n        if (nextByte <0) {\n            return nextByte;\n        }\n        // Take the first 'needed' bits",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this buggy Java function. Let me read through the problem and understand what's going wrong.\n\nThe function is called readBits, and it's supposed to read a certain number of bits from an input stream. The issue arises when bitsCachedSize is 57 or more. Shifting it left by 8 bits causes an overflow because it's stored in an int, which is 32 bits. So when bitsCachedSize is >=57, adding 8 makes it 65, which is beyond the 32-bit limit. That's causing incorrect values in bitsCached, leading to assertion failures.\n\nThe root cause is that bitsCachedSize is an int, and when it's shifted left by 8, it overflows. So, the suggestion is to use a larger data type, like long, for bitsCachedSize.\n\nLooking at the original code, bitsCachedSize is declared as an int. So, I need to change that to a long. But wait, in the code provided, I don't see where bitsCachedSize is declared. Oh right, it's probably a class-level variable. So, I'll have to change its declaration from int to long elsewhere. But since the function is provided, I can adjust it within the function if possible, but likely, it's a class variable.\n\nWait, in the function, bitsCachedSize is being used and modified. So, if it's a class variable, changing it to a long would require changing its type in the class. But the function itself can handle it as a long by casting or by the class's declaration.\n\nSo, in the function, when bitsCachedSize is used in the shift operation, it's an int. So, to prevent overflow, we should cast it to a long before shifting. Alternatively, make sure that bitsCachedSize is a long.\n\nBut the suggestion was to use a larger data type for bitsCachedSize. So, perhaps the class should have bitsCachedSize as a long. But since I can't change the class here, maybe within the function, I can handle it.\n\nWait, looking at the function, bitsCachedSize is being incremented by 8 each time. So, if it's an int, it can go up to 57, then adding 8 would make it 65, which is beyond the 32-bit signed int limit (which is 2^31 -1 = 2147483647). Wait, no, 65 is way below that. Wait, 32 bits can hold up to 2^31-1 for positive numbers. So 57 is okay, but when you shift an int by 8 bits, it's still okay because 57 <<8 is 57*256=14592, which is way below 2^31. Wait, but maybe the problem is not with the size but with the shifting in the code.\n\nWait, looking at the code, in the little-endian case, it does bitsCached |= (nextByte << bitsCachedSize). So, if bitsCachedSize is 57, then nextByte is shifted left by 57 bits. But nextByte is a long, so that's okay. Wait, nextByte is read as a long, but in Java, it's actually an int because in.read() returns an int, but it's cast to a long. So, when you do nextByte << bitsCachedSize, if bitsCachedSize is 57, that's a shift of 57 bits on a long, which is fine because a long is 64 bits. So shifting 57 bits is okay.\n\nWait, but in the else case, it's bitsCached <<=8, then OR with nextByte. So, in that case, bitsCached is a long, so shifting it left by 8 is fine.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not in the shifting of nextByte, but in the bitsCachedSize variable itself. Because if bitsCachedSize is an int, and it's being incremented beyond 32 bits, but wait, 32 bits can hold up to 2^31-1, which is 2,147,483,647. So, 57 is way below that. So, why is there an overflow?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when bitsCachedSize is 57, and you shift nextByte (a long) by 57 bits, that's okay because a long can handle that. But maybe the problem is elsewhere.\n\nWait, the comment says that when bitsCachedSize >=57, shifting it left by 8 bits would cause an overflow. Wait, but in the code, bitsCachedSize is used as the shift amount for nextByte. So, if bitsCachedSize is 57, nextByte << 57 is a 64-bit operation, so it's okay. So perhaps the issue is not in that part.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the calculation of bitsOut. Let me look at that part.\n\nIn the little-endian case, bitsOut is (bitsCached & MASKS[count]). Then bitsCached is shifted right by count bits. But if bitsCachedSize is larger than count, perhaps that's okay.\n\nWait, the problem occurs when bitsCachedSize is >=57. So, perhaps when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is, say, 64, but wait, the function starts by checking if count is greater than MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. So, perhaps MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE is 64 or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when bitsCachedSize is 57, and you read another byte, which adds 8 bits, making it 65. Then, when you try to shift bitsCached, which is a long, by 65 bits, that's okay because a long can handle shifts up to 63. Wait, no, shifting a long by 65 bits is actually done modulo 64, so it's equivalent to shifting by 1 bit. So that could cause incorrect behavior.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, if bitsCachedSize is 57, and you add 8, making it 65. Then, in the else case, you do bitsCached <<=8, which is okay because 65 is within the 64-bit limit. Wait, no, 65 is beyond 64, so shifting a long by 65 bits is the same as shifting by 1 bit. So, that would cause the bits to shift incorrectly.\n\nAh, that's the problem. So, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and you read another byte, you add 8, making it 65. Then, in the else case, you shift bitsCached left by 8, which is 65 bits in total. But since it's a long, shifting by 65 is equivalent to shifting by 1 (65 % 64 =1). So, that would cause the bits to be shifted incorrectly, leading to wrong values.\n\nSo, the issue is that when bitsCachedSize is 57 or more, adding 8 makes it 65, which when used as a shift amount for a long (which is 64 bits) causes the shift to wrap around.\n\nSo, the solution is to prevent bitsCachedSize from exceeding 63, because shifting a long by more than 63 bits is undefined or wraps around.\n\nWait, but in the code, bitsCachedSize is being used as the number of bits cached. So, each time a byte is read, 8 bits are added. So, the maximum bitsCachedSize can be is up to the maximum number of bits that can be read, which depends on the input stream.\n\nSo, the problem is that when bitsCachedSize is 57, adding 8 makes it 65, which is more than 64. So, when you shift bitsCached (a long) by 8 bits in the else case, you end up with a shift that's effectively 1 bit, which corrupts the data.\n\nSo, how can we fix this?\n\nOne approach is to ensure that bitsCachedSize does not exceed 63. Because once it's 63, adding 8 would make it 71, which is way beyond 64. So, perhaps we need to limit the number of bits we cache to 64 bits maximum.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to read up to MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE bits. So, perhaps MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE is set to 64, but in the code, the function allows count up to MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which may be 64.\n\nWait, the function starts with:\n\nif (count <0 || count > MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) throw...\n\nSo, if MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE is 64, then the maximum count is 64.\n\nSo, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we need to read 8 more bits, making it 65, which is beyond 64. So, perhaps the function should not allow reading beyond 64 bits.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to handle counts up to MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is probably 64. So, in that case, the maximum bitsCachedSize would be 64, and adding 8 would make it 72, which is way beyond.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is designed to cache up to a certain number of bits, say 64, and beyond that, it's not handled correctly.\n\nSo, the problem is that when bitsCachedSize is 57, and we read another byte (8 bits), making it 65, which is more than 64. Then, when we try to shift bitsCached left by 8, it's actually shifting by 65 bits, which is 1 bit due to modulo 64, causing incorrect data.\n\nSo, the solution is to prevent bitsCachedSize from exceeding 63. Because 63 +8 =71, which modulo 64 is 7, so shifting by 7 bits. That's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to change the data type of bitsCachedSize from int to long, so that it can hold larger values without overflowing. But wait, shifting a long by a large number of bits is still problematic because the shift amount is taken modulo 64.\n\nSo, perhaps the real issue is that the code allows bitsCachedSize to exceed 63, which when used as a shift amount for a long, causes the shift to wrap around.\n\nSo, the solution is to ensure that bitsCachedSize does not exceed 63. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the function should not allow reading more than 64 bits. So, in the function, the maximum count is MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is 64. So, when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, the while loop will run once, adding 8 bits, making bitsCachedSize 65. Then, when processing, it's a problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should limit the number of bits it reads to 64, and once it's reached 64, it shouldn't read more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should process the data in chunks, ensuring that it doesn't accumulate more than 64 bits.\n\nWait, but the function is designed to read up to MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE bits, which is 64. So, perhaps the function should not allow bitsCachedSize to exceed 64.\n\nSo, in the while loop, it should stop once bitsCachedSize reaches count, which is up to 64.\n\nWait, but when bitsCachedSize is 57, and count is 64, the loop will run once, adding 8, making it 65, which is more than 64. So, that's the problem.\n\nSo, the solution is to change the loop condition to ensure that bitsCachedSize does not exceed count. Wait, no, the loop is while (bitsCachedSize < count). So, if count is 64, and bitsCachedSize is 57, it will run once, adding 8, making it 65, which is >= count (64). So, the loop stops.\n\nBut then, when processing, bitsCachedSize is 65, which is more than 64, causing issues when shifting.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should ensure that bitsCachedSize does not exceed count, which is up to 64. So, in the loop, after adding 8, if it exceeds count, we should adjust it.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the bits are being read in 8-bit chunks. So, perhaps the function should read exactly the number of bytes needed to reach count bits, without exceeding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should read as many bytes as needed without exceeding the required count.\n\nWait, let's think about how the function works. It's trying to read 'count' number of bits. Each iteration reads one byte (8 bits). So, the number of bytes read is (count - bitsCachedSize +7)/8, rounded up.\n\nBut in the current code, it's reading bytes until bitsCachedSize is >= count. So, it may read more than necessary.\n\nWait, for example, if count is 64, and bitsCachedSize is 57, it reads one more byte, adding 8 bits, making it 65. Then, when extracting the bits, it takes the first 64 bits, but the way it's done may be incorrect because of the shifting.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to read exactly the number of bytes needed to reach 'count' bits, without exceeding. So, in the loop, we should read bytes only until bitsCachedSize +8 <= count, but that's not possible because count may not be a multiple of 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should read the minimal number of bytes needed to reach at least 'count' bits, and then when extracting, it takes exactly 'count' bits.\n\nBut the problem arises when bitsCachedSize exceeds 64, causing shifts beyond 63, which wraps around.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to change the data type of bitsCachedSize from int to long. But that alone may not solve the problem because shifting a long by more than 63 bits is still an issue.\n\nWait, but in Java, when you shift a long by a value greater than or equal to 64, it's done modulo 64. So, shifting by 65 is the same as shifting by 1. So, that's the problem.\n\nSo, to prevent this, we need to ensure that the shift amount is always less than 64.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should not allow bitsCachedSize to exceed 63. Because once it's 63, adding 8 would make it 71, which modulo 64 is 7, leading to incorrect shifts.\n\nSo, the solution is to change the data type of bitsCachedSize to long, but also ensure that when it's used as a shift amount, it doesn't exceed 63.\n\nWait, but how can we do that? Because the function is supposed to handle up to 64 bits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should process the data in two parts: when bitsCachedSize is less than 64, and when it's more.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should split the bits into higher and lower parts when bitsCachedSize exceeds 64.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should limit the number of bits it caches to 64, and once it reaches that, it stops reading more bytes.\n\nSo, in the loop, after each read, if bitsCachedSize exceeds 64, we set it to 64.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the function is supposed to read exactly 'count' bits.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should read exactly the number of bytes needed to reach 'count' bits, without exceeding. So, for example, if count is 64, and bitsCachedSize is 57, it reads one more byte (8 bits), making it 65, but then when extracting, it only takes the first 64 bits.\n\nBut in the code, when extracting, it does:\n\nif (byteOrder == LITTLE_ENDIAN) {\n    bitsOut = bitsCached & MASKS[count];\n    bitsCached >>>= count;\n} else {\n    bitsOut = (bitsCached >> (bitsCachedSize - count)) & MASKS[count];\n}\n\nSo, in the else case, it's shifting bitsCached right by (bitsCachedSize - count) bits.\n\nIf bitsCachedSize is 65 and count is 64, then (65-64)=1, so it shifts right by 1 bit. Then, it masks with MASKS[64], which is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFL.\n\nWait, but MASKS[count] for count=64 is all 1s, so the mask doesn't change anything. So, bitsOut would be bitsCached >>1.\n\nBut that's incorrect because we need the top 64 bits, not the top 64 bits shifted right by 1.\n\nSo, the problem is that when bitsCachedSize is 65, the shift amount is 1, which drops the highest bit.\n\nSo, the solution is to ensure that when bitsCachedSize is greater than count, the shift amount is (bitsCachedSize - count), but that amount must not exceed 63.\n\nWait, but if bitsCachedSize is 65 and count is 64, then (65-64)=1, which is okay. But if bitsCachedSize is 72 and count is 64, then (72-64)=8, which is also okay.\n\nWait, but in the case where bitsCachedSize is 65, the shift is 1, which is correct because the bits we need are in the higher positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is not in the extraction, but in the way bits are being cached.\n\nWait, let's think about the little-endian case. When bits are added in little-endian order, each new byte is shifted left by bitsCachedSize and OR'ed into bitsCached. So, if bitsCachedSize is 57, the next byte is shifted left by 57, which is okay because it's a long. Then, bitsCachedSize becomes 65.\n\nWhen extracting, bitsOut is bitsCached & MASKS[count]. So, if count is 64, MASKS[64] is all 1s, so bitsOut is bitsCached, but then bitsCached is shifted right by count (64), which would leave bitsCached as 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, bitsCachedSize is 65, so after shifting right by 64, bitsCached would have the highest bit (the 65th bit) shifted out, but since it's a long, shifting right by 64 would leave the higher 64 bits as 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when bitsCachedSize is 65, the bits are being stored beyond the 64-bit capacity, causing the higher bits to be lost when shifting.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to limit bitsCachedSize to 64, and once it reaches that, stop reading more bytes.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the function should read exactly the number of bytes needed to reach 'count' bits, without exceeding. So, the number of bytes to read is (count - bitsCachedSize +7)/8, but not more than needed.\n\nBut in the current code, it's reading bytes until bitsCachedSize >= count, which can cause it to read one extra byte beyond what's needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the loop should read bytes only while bitsCachedSize < count, but also ensure that each read doesn't cause bitsCachedSize to exceed count.\n\nWait, but each read adds 8 bits, so it's possible that after a read, bitsCachedSize exceeds count.\n\nSo, perhaps after reading a byte, we should check if bitsCachedSize exceeds count, and if so, adjust it.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the function is supposed to read exactly 'count' bits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should read the minimal number of bytes needed to reach at least 'count' bits, and then when extracting, it takes exactly 'count' bits from the cached bits.\n\nBut the problem is that when bitsCachedSize exceeds 64, the shifting causes issues.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to change the data type of bitsCachedSize to long, but also ensure that when it's used as a shift amount, it doesn't exceed 63.\n\nWait, but in Java, when you shift a long by a value >=64, it's done modulo 64. So, shifting by 65 is the same as shifting by 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to mask the shift amount to 63 when it's used for shifting.\n\nBut that might not be the correct approach because the shift amount should be the actual number of bits needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should split the bits into higher and lower parts when bitsCachedSize exceeds 64.\n\nBut that complicates the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the root cause is that bitsCachedSize is an int, and when it's 57, adding 8 makes it 65, which when used as a shift amount for a long, causes the shift to wrap around.\n\nSo, the solution is to change bitsCachedSize from int to long, so that it can hold larger values without overflowing. But wait, shifting a long by 65 bits is still a problem because it's equivalent to shifting by 1 bit.\n\nSo, perhaps the real issue is that the function allows bitsCachedSize to exceed 63, which when used as a shift amount, causes incorrect shifts.\n\nSo, the solution is to ensure that bitsCachedSize does not exceed 63. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the function should not read more than 64 bits. So, the maximum count is 64, and the function should ensure that bitsCachedSize does not exceed 64.\n\nSo, in the loop, after reading a byte, if bitsCachedSize +8 would exceed 64, then read only the necessary bits.\n\nWait, but that's complicated because each read is a full byte.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should read exactly the number of bytes needed to reach 'count' bits, without exceeding.\n\nSo, the number of bytes to read is (count - bitsCachedSize +7)/8. So, for example, if count is 64 and bitsCachedSize is 57, then (64-57+7)/8 = (14)/8=1.75, which is rounded up to 2 bytes. But that would make bitsCachedSize 57+16=73, which is way beyond.\n\nWait, that's not correct. So, perhaps the function should read the minimal number of bytes needed to reach at least 'count' bits, but then when extracting, it takes exactly 'count' bits.\n\nBut the problem is that when bitsCachedSize is larger than count, the shift amounts can be larger than 63, causing issues.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to change the data type of bitsCachedSize to long, and when using it as a shift amount, mask it to 63.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the shift amount should be the actual number of bits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should handle the case where bitsCachedSize exceeds 64 by splitting the bits into two parts: the higher part beyond 64 and the lower part.\n\nBut that would complicate the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should limit the number of bits it reads to 64, and once it reaches that, it stops reading. So, in the loop, after each read, if bitsCachedSize exceeds 64, set it to 64.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the function is supposed to read exactly 'count' bits, which could be up to 64.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should read exactly the number of bytes needed to reach 'count' bits, and no more.\n\nSo, the number of bytes to read is (count - bitsCachedSize +7)/8, but only if that doesn't exceed the available bytes.\n\nWait, but in the current code, it's reading bytes until bitsCachedSize >= count, which can cause it to read one extra byte beyond what's needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the loop should be modified to read the exact number of bytes needed.\n\nSo, the number of bytes needed is (count - bitsCachedSize +7)/8. So, for example, if count is 64 and bitsCachedSize is 57, then (64-57+7)/8 = 14/8=1.75, which is 1 byte. So, read 1 byte, adding 8 bits, making bitsCachedSize 65. But that's still beyond 64.\n\nWait, but 57 +8=65, which is more than 64. So, perhaps the function should read only the number of bytes needed to reach exactly 'count' bits, but since each byte is 8 bits,",
