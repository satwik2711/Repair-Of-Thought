This is likely due to the fact that the `headerMap` field is not populated when the CSV parser is created with a CSV string that has a header row.\nSuggestion: Initialize headerMap in the CSVParser constructor\nThe `headerMap` field can be initialized in the `CSVParser` constructor when the CSV string is parsed.

This is likely due to the fact that the `headerMap` field is not populated when the CSV parser is created with a CSV string that has a header row.\nSuggestion: Check for null before creating a new LinkedHashMap\nThe `getHeaderMap` method can be modified to check if the `headerMap` field is null before creating a new `LinkedHashMap`. If the `headerMap` field is null, the method can return an empty map or throw a custom exception. This approach is simple and efficient, but it may not provide the desired behavior if the `headerMap` field is intentionally null.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Map<String, Integer> getHeaderMap() {\n    return new LinkedHashMap<String, Integer>(this.headerMap);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is likely due to the fact that the `headerMap` field is not populated when the CSV parser is created with a CSV string that has a header row.\nSuggestion: Initialize headerMap lazily\nThe `headerMap` field can be initialized lazily in the `getHeaderMap` method.

This approach is efficient and provides the desired behavior, but it requires modifying the `getHeaderMap` method to handle the lazy initialization.\n\nHere is the modified code for\n// Buggy Function\npublic Map<String, Integer> getHeaderMap() {\n    return new LinkedHashMap<String, Integer>(this.headerMap);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
