      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `ConcurrentModificationException` occurs because we're trying to remove an attribute from the `attributes` map while iterating over its keys using an `Iterator`. This is not allowed because the iterator is designed to fail-fast, meaning it will throw an exception if the underlying collection is modified structurally while the iterator is still active. In this case, the `remove` method modifies the `attributes` map, causing the iterator to fail.\nSuggestion: Using an Iterator's Remove Method\nInstead of calling `attributes.remove(attrKey)` directly, we can use the `Iterator`'s `remove` method to safely remove the attribute from the map. This method is designed to work with the iterator and will not cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`. We can modify the buggy function as follows:\n```java\nfor (Iterator<String> it = attributes.keySet().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\n    String attrKey = it.next();\n    if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n        it.remove();\n}\n```\nThis approach is straightforward and efficient, as it avoids the need to create a temporary collection or use a different data structure.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void removeIgnoreCase(String key) {\n    Validate.notEmpty(key);\n    if (attributes == null)\n        return;\n    for (Iterator<String> it = attributes.keySet().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\n        String attrKey = it.next();\n        if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n            attributes.remove(attrKey);\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

In this case, the `remove` method modifies the `attributes` map, causing the iterator to fail.\nSuggestion: Creating a Temporary Collection\nAnother approach is to create a temporary collection to store the keys to be removed, and then iterate over this collection to remove the attributes from the map. This approach avoids the `ConcurrentModificationException` by not modifying the original map while iterating over it. We can modify the buggy function as follows:\n```java\nList<String> keysToRemove = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (String attrKey : attributes.keySet()) {\n    if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n        keysToRemove.add(attrKey);\n}\nfor (String keyToRemove : keysToRemove) {\n    attributes.remove(keyToRemove);\n}\n```\nThis approach is more verbose than the first suggestion, but it provides a clear and safe way to remove attributes from the map.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void removeIgnoreCase(String key) {\n    Validate.notEmpty(key);\n    if (attributes == null)\n        return;\n    for (Iterator<String> it = attributes.keySet().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\n        String attrKey = it.next();\n        if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n            attributes.remove(attrKey);\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

In this case, the `remove` method modifies the `attributes` map, causing the iterator to fail.\nSuggestion: Using Java 8's Stream API\nIf we're using Java 8 or later, we can use the Stream API to remove attributes from the map in a concise and safe way. We can modify the buggy function as follows:\n```java\nattributes.keySet().stream()\n    .filter(attrKey -> attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n    .forEach(attributes::remove);\n```\nThis approach is more concise than the previous suggestions, but it requires Java 8 or later.
