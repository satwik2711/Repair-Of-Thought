      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the buildWriter function. The problem is that when a property is null and the inclusion is set to NON_DEFAULT, the function isn't suppressing the null property correctly. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLooking at the root cause, the issue arises because the function doesn't correctly determine the default value for the property when it's null. So, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, nulls should be suppressed, but they aren't.\n\nThe suggestion is to add a check at the beginning of the function. The check should see if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and valueToSuppress is null. If so, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nWait, but in the current code, valueToSuppress is initialized to null. So when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, if valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is set to true. But maybe that's not sufficient.\n\nLet me look at the existing code. In the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, the code tries to get the default value. If _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it gets the property's default value. Otherwise, it gets the default value of the type and sets suppressNulls to true. Then, if valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is set to true again.\n\nHmm, but the problem is that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it's not being suppressed. So maybe the current logic isn't handling the case where the default value is null.\n\nWait, the fix suggestion says to add a check at the beginning. So perhaps before the switch statement, we should check if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and valueToSuppress is null, then set suppressNulls to true.\n\nBut wait, in the current code, valueToSuppress is set based on the inclusion. So maybe the initial approach is to add this condition before the switch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the function isn't correctly determining that it should suppress the null. So adding the suggested condition would handle that.\n\nSo, I should add the following code before the switch statement:\n\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n\nWait, but where exactly? Because valueToSuppress is initialized to null at the beginning. So if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and valueToSuppress is null, which it is initially, then suppressNulls would be set to true. But then, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, it might overwrite this.\n\nWait, let me think about the flow. The code initializes valueToSuppress to null and suppressNulls to false. Then, it determines the inclusion. Then, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, it sets valueToSuppress based on the default value.\n\nSo, if the default value is null, then valueToSuppress remains null, and after the switch case, suppressNulls is set to true. But perhaps in some cases, the default value isn't correctly determined, so valueToSuppress isn't set, leading to suppressNulls not being set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial check should be placed after the switch case. Or maybe the logic in the switch case isn't handling the case where the default value is null correctly.\n\nWait, the fix suggestion says to add the check at the beginning of the function. So perhaps before the switch, we check if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and valueToSuppress is null. If so, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nBut wait, valueToSuppress is null at that point, so this condition would always be true for NON_DEFAULT inclusion. That might not be correct because the switch case might set suppressNulls again.\n\nHmm, maybe the correct approach is to add this condition after the switch case. Or perhaps the initial approach is to adjust the logic in the switch case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the function doesn't set suppressNulls correctly because the default value is null, and the code doesn't handle that.\n\nWait, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it gets the property's default value. If that's null, then valueToSuppress is null, and suppressNulls is set to true. Otherwise, if _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, it gets the default value of the type and sets suppressNulls to true. Then, if valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is set to true again.\n\nSo, in that case, when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, suppressNulls should be true. But perhaps in some cases, it's not being set correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when the property is null, but the default value is non-null, the function should suppress it if the value equals the default. But if the default is null, then it's supposed to suppress it as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of the default, it should be suppressed. But the current code only sets suppressNulls to true if the default is null.\n\nWait, no. The NON_DEFAULT inclusion is supposed to suppress the property if it's null or if it's equal to the default value. So, if the default is null, then a null property should be suppressed. But if the default is non-null, then a null property would not be equal to the default, so it should not be suppressed. Hmm, that's conflicting with the initial problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem is that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, null properties should be suppressed. So regardless of the default, if the property is null, it should be suppressed.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: NON_DEFAULT inclusion means that a property is included only if it's not null and not equal to the default value. So, if the property is null, it should be suppressed. If the property is non-null but equals the default, it's also suppressed.\n\nSo, in the case where the property is null, regardless of the default, it should be suppressed when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT.\n\nIn the current code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, if the default value is null, then suppressNulls is set to true. But if the default is non-null, then suppressNulls is false, and the code relies on the valueToSuppress to determine if the property should be suppressed.\n\nWait, but if the property is null, then in the NON_DEFAULT case, it should be suppressed regardless of the default. So, perhaps the code is not correctly setting suppressNulls in all cases.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and the property is null, suppressNulls is set to true.\n\nLooking back at the code, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it gets the property's default value. If that's null, suppressNulls is set to true. If it's non-null, then suppressNulls remains false, but the code sets valueToSuppress to the default. Then, during serialization, if the property's value is null, it would be compared to the default, but since the default is non-null, it would not be suppressed. But according to NON_DEFAULT inclusion, null properties should be suppressed regardless.\n\nWait, no. NON_DEFAULT inclusion should suppress properties that are null OR equal to the default. So, if the property is null, it should be suppressed. If the property is non-null but equals the default, it should be suppressed. So, in the case where the property is null, regardless of the default, it should be suppressed.\n\nSo, in the code, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, we need to set suppressNulls to true if the property is null. But how do we know if the property is null at this point? Because in the buildWriter function, we don't have the actual value; we're just setting up the writer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current code doesn't set suppressNulls to true when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and the default is non-null. So, when the property is null, it's not being suppressed because suppressNulls is false.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, suppressNulls is set to true, regardless of the default value. Because if the property is null, it should be suppressed.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because NON_DEFAULT should suppress nulls and also default values. So, perhaps the initial approach is to set suppressNulls to true when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and also set valueToSuppress to the default value.\n\nWait, looking at the current code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it gets the property's default value. If that's null, suppressNulls is set to true. Otherwise, valueToSuppress is set to the default, and suppressNulls is false. But that's incorrect because if the property is null, it should be suppressed regardless of the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to set suppressNulls to true when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and then set valueToSuppress to the default value. That way, during serialization, if the property is null, it's suppressed, and if it's equal to the default, it's also suppressed.\n\nSo, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, regardless of whether the default is null or not, suppressNulls should be set to true. Because if the property is null, it should be suppressed. Additionally, if the property is non-null but equals the default, it should be suppressed as well.\n\nWait, but in the current code, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, and the default is non-null, suppressNulls is set to false. That's incorrect because null properties should still be suppressed.\n\nSo, the fix is to set suppressNulls to true in all cases where inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and then set valueToSuppress to the default value. Because if the property is null, it's suppressed, and if it's equal to the default, it's also suppressed.\n\nSo, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, we should set suppressNulls to true, and set valueToSuppress to the default value, regardless of whether the default is null or not.\n\nBut wait, in the current code, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, it sets valueToSuppress to the type's default and sets suppressNulls to true. That seems correct because if the default is null, then null properties are suppressed, and non-null properties equal to default are also suppressed.\n\nBut when _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, and the default is non-null, the code sets valueToSuppress to the default and leaves suppressNulls as false. That's incorrect because null properties should still be suppressed.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that suppressNulls is set to true when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of the default value.\n\nTherefore, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, after setting valueToSuppress, we should set suppressNulls to true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of adding the suggested check at the beginning is better. Let me see.\n\nThe suggestion is to add:\n\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n\nBut where should this be placed? If placed before the switch, then for NON_DEFAULT inclusion, if valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is set to true. But in the switch case, valueToSuppress might be set to a non-null value, which would override this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct place is after the switch case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the default value is null, the code correctly sets suppressNulls to true, but when the default is non-null, it doesn't. So, in that case, null properties are not suppressed.\n\nSo, to fix this, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, after setting valueToSuppress, we should set suppressNulls to true.\n\nWait, let me think again. The NON_DEFAULT inclusion should suppress the property if it's null OR if it's equal to the default value.\n\nSo, during serialization, the writer should check if the value is null (suppress) or equal to the default (suppress). So, in the writer, both conditions are checked.\n\nBut in the buildWriter function, we're setting up the suppressNulls and valueToSuppress variables. So, suppressNulls is whether to suppress nulls, and valueToSuppress is the default to compare against.\n\nSo, for NON_DEFAULT inclusion, we need to set suppressNulls to true (so that nulls are suppressed) and set valueToSuppress to the default (so that non-null values equal to default are suppressed).\n\nIn the current code, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, and the default is non-null, suppressNulls is set to false, which is incorrect because nulls should still be suppressed.\n\nSo, the fix is to set suppressNulls to true in all cases where inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of the default value.\n\nSo, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, after setting valueToSuppress, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of adding the suggested check is better.\n\nWait, the suggested code is:\n\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n\nBut in the current code, after the switch case, valueToSuppress could be null or not. So, perhaps adding this condition after the switch case would cover the case where the default is null, ensuring suppressNulls is true.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the switch case for NON_DEFAULT to always set suppressNulls to true, because nulls should always be suppressed when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT.\n\nSo, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT:\n\ncase NON_DEFAULT:\n    // existing code to get valueToSuppress\n    suppressNulls = true;\n    break;\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because in some cases, like when the default is non-null, we still need to suppress nulls.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct fix is to set suppressNulls to true in the NON_DEFAULT case, regardless of the default.\n\nSo, in the switch case, after setting valueToSuppress, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nLet me look at the current code in the NON_DEFAULT case:\n\nif (_useRealPropertyDefaults) {\n    // get property default\n    if (valueToSuppress == null) {\n        suppressNulls = true;\n    } else {\n        // array handling\n    }\n} else {\n    valueToSuppress = getDefaultValue(actualType);\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\nif (valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n} else {\n    // array handling\n}\n\nWait, so in the case where _useRealPropertyDefaults is true and the property's default is non-null, suppressNulls is set to false. That's incorrect because null properties should be suppressed.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that suppressNulls is set to true in all cases where inclusion is NON_DEFAULT.\n\nTherefore, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, after handling the default value, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nSo, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nIn the switch case for NON_DEFAULT:\n\n// existing code to get valueToSuppress\nsuppressNulls = true; // Ensure nulls are suppressed\n\nBut wait, in the current code, after getting valueToSuppress, if it's null, suppressNulls is set to true. So, perhaps the issue is that when the default is non-null, suppressNulls is not set to true.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to set suppressNulls to true regardless of the default value.\n\nSo, in the switch case:\n\ncase NON_DEFAULT:\n    // existing code to get valueToSuppress\n    suppressNulls = true;\n    break;\n\nThat way, null properties are always suppressed when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and non-null properties are compared against the default.\n\nSo, the fix is to add suppressNulls = true; in the NON_DEFAULT case, after handling the default value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial suggestion of adding the condition before the switch is better.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to modify the switch case to set suppressNulls to true.\n\nSo, in the code, after the existing handling, set suppressNulls = true.\n\nSo, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT:\n\n// existing code\nif (_useRealPropertyDefaults) {\n    // ... get valueToSuppress\n    if (valueToSuppress == null) {\n        suppressNulls = true;\n    } else {\n        // array handling\n    }\n} else {\n    valueToSuppress = getDefaultValue(actualType);\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\nif (valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n} else {\n    // array handling\n}\n\n// Add this line to ensure suppressNulls is true\nsuppressNulls = true;\n\nWait, but that would override the previous settings. So, perhaps that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of adding the suggested condition is better. Let me try adding the suggested code.\n\nThe suggestion is to add:\n\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n\nWhere should this be placed? Perhaps after the switch statement.\n\nWait, after the switch, the code proceeds to create the BeanPropertyWriter. So, perhaps adding this condition after the switch would cover the case where inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and valueToSuppress is null, setting suppressNulls to true.\n\nBut in the switch case, for NON_DEFAULT, valueToSuppress could be set to a non-null value, so the condition wouldn't trigger. But if valueToSuppress is null, then suppressNulls would be set to true.\n\nWait, but in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, if _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, valueToSuppress is set to the default, and suppressNulls is set to true. So, in that case, the suggested condition wouldn't change anything.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the switch case to ensure that suppressNulls is true when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of the default.\n\nSo, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, after handling the default, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ncase NON_DEFAULT:\n    // existing code\n    suppressNulls = true;\n    break;\n\nThat way, regardless of the default, nulls are suppressed.\n\nBut wait, in the existing code, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is true and the default is non-null, suppressNulls is set to false. So, adding suppressNulls = true; after that would correct it.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in the switch case, after all the existing code, set suppressNulls to true.\n\nSo, the modified code would be:\n\ncase NON_DEFAULT:\n    // existing code to get valueToSuppress\n    suppressNulls = true;\n    break;\n\nThis ensures that for NON_DEFAULT inclusion, suppressNulls is always true, so null properties are suppressed.\n\nI think that's the correct fix. So, in the switch case for NON_DEFAULT, after handling the default value, set suppressNulls to true.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where the `buildWriter` function does not correctly suppress null properties when the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`, we need to ensure that `suppressNulls` is set to `true` in all cases where inclusion is `NON_DEFAULT`. This modification ensures that null properties are suppressed as required.\n\n```java\nprotected BeanPropertyWriter buildWriter(SerializerProvider prov,\n        BeanPropertyDefinition propDef, JavaType declaredType, JsonSerializer<?> ser,\n        TypeSerializer typeSer, TypeSerializer contentTypeSer,\n        AnnotatedMember am, boolean defaultUseStaticTyping)\n    throws JsonMappingException\n{\n    // do we have annotation that forces type to use (to declared type or its super type)?\n    JavaType serializationType;\n    try {\n        serializationType = findSerializationType(am, defaultUseStaticTyping, declaredType);\n    } catch (JsonMappingException e) {\n        return prov.reportBadPropertyDefinition(_beanDesc, propDef, e.getMessage());\n    }\n\n    // Container types can have separate type serializers for content (value / element) type\n    if (contentTypeSer != null) {\n        /* 04-Feb-2010, tatu: Let's force static typing for collection, if there is\n         *    type information for contents.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the buildWriter function. The root cause is that when a property is null and the inclusion is set to NON_DEFAULT, the function isn't correctly suppressing the null property. The problem lies in how the default value is determined.\n\nLooking at the code, the issue is in the section where inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. The current code tries to get the default value, but it doesn't handle the case where the property is null correctly. \n\nThe suggestion is to modify the getPropertyDefaultValue function to return null when the value is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. But since I'm working within the buildWriter function, I need to adjust how valueToSuppress is determined.\n\nWait, in the current code, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it checks if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true. If so, it calls getPropertyDefaultValue, else it uses getDefaultValue and sets suppressNulls to true. \n\nBut when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, we should suppress it. So perhaps in the NON_DEFAULT case, if the value is null, we should set valueToSuppress to null and suppressNulls to true.\n\nWait, looking at the code, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it sets valueToSuppress based on the default value. If the default is null, then suppressNulls is set to true. But maybe that's not sufficient because the property's actual value is null, not the default.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the function should not include it. So in the case where the property is null, regardless of the default, it should be suppressed.\n\nWait, the current code sets valueToSuppress to the default value. So if the property is null, and the default is non-null, it would compare and not suppress. But if the property is null and the default is null, then it would suppress. But that's not correct for NON_DEFAULT inclusion because NON_DEFAULT should suppress properties that are null and have a default value, but if the default is also null, perhaps it's treated differently.\n\nWait, the NON_DEFAULT inclusion is supposed to suppress the property if it's null and the default is non-null. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think about the intended behavior.\n\nJsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT means that a property is included only if it's not null and not equal to its default value. So if the property is null, it should be suppressed regardless of the default, because null is considered the default in some cases.\n\nWait, no. NON_DEFAULT is supposed to suppress the property if it's in its default state. For objects, the default is typically null. So if the property is null, it's considered default and should be suppressed. \n\nSo in the buildWriter function, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, if the property is null, it should be suppressed. \n\nLooking at the code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, it sets valueToSuppress to the default value. Then, if valueToSuppress is null, it sets suppressNulls to true. So if the default is null, then suppressNulls is true, which would cause the property to be suppressed if it's null.\n\nBut what if the default is non-null? For example, if the default is an empty string, and the property is null, then the property should be suppressed because it's null, which is the default for the type.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when the property is null, regardless of the default, it should be suppressed when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. Because null is the default for most types.\n\nSo perhaps in the NON_DEFAULT case, we should set suppressNulls to true. But wait, the current code already does that when valueToSuppress is null. But if the default is non-null, then valueToSuppress is non-null, and suppressNulls remains false. That would mean that if the property is null, it would be included because suppressNulls is false, but that's incorrect because for NON_DEFAULT, null should be suppressed.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. NON_DEFAULT means that the property is included only if it's not null AND not equal to the default value. So if the property is null, regardless of the default, it should be suppressed. Because null is the default for the type.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the default value is an empty string. If the property is null, it's different from the default, so it should be included. But according to NON_DEFAULT, it should be included only if it's not the default. So if the default is empty string, and the property is null, then it's not the default, so it should be included. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the inclusion. Let me check the JsonInclude.Include documentation.\n\nJsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT: Indicates that a property will be serialized only if it has a value that is different from the default one. For objects, default is null. For primitives, default is their default values (0, false, etc.). So for a property that is null, if the default is null, it's suppressed. If the default is non-null, then null is different from the default, so it's included.\n\nWait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So if the default is null, and the property is null, it's suppressed. If the default is non-null, and the property is null, it's included because it's different from the default.\n\nSo the current code in the NON_DEFAULT case sets valueToSuppress to the default value. Then, if the property's value is equal to valueToSuppress, it's suppressed. So if the property is null, and the default is null, it's suppressed. If the default is non-null, and the property is null, it's included because null != default.\n\nBut the bug is that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it's not being suppressed correctly. So perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the property is null, and the default is null.\n\nWait, the problem arises when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. The code should check if the property is null, and if so, determine whether to suppress it based on the default.\n\nBut in the current code, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it sets valueToSuppress to the default value. Then, if the property's value is equal to valueToSuppress, it's suppressed. So if the property is null, and the default is null, it's suppressed. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but the bug report says that the function is not correctly handling the case where the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. So perhaps the code is not correctly determining the default value when the property is null.\n\nWait, looking at the code, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it does:\n\nif (_useRealPropertyDefaults) {\n    valueToSuppress = getPropertyDefaultValue(propDef.getName(), am, actualType);\n} else {\n    valueToSuppress = getDefaultValue(actualType);\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n\nSo if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it gets the default value from the property. Else, it gets the default value from the type and sets suppressNulls to true.\n\nBut perhaps when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code is not correctly setting suppressNulls. Because in the else case, suppressNulls is set to true, which would cause the property to be suppressed if it's null, regardless of the default.\n\nWait, no. Because in the else case, valueToSuppress is set to the default value, and suppressNulls is set to true. So if the property is null, it would be suppressed because suppressNulls is true, regardless of whether the default is null or not.\n\nBut according to the inclusion logic, that's not correct. Because if the default is non-null, a null property should be included, not suppressed.\n\nSo the problem is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code sets suppressNulls to true, which causes the property to be suppressed even if the default is non-null. That's incorrect because in that case, the property should be included.\n\nSo the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code correctly determines whether to suppress the property based on whether the property's value is equal to the default value, not just based on whether it's null.\n\nBut how can we adjust the code to do that?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code sets suppressNulls to true, which causes the property to be suppressed if it's null, even when the default is non-null. That's incorrect because, in that case, the property should be included.\n\nSo the fix is to avoid setting suppressNulls to true in the else case when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. Instead, we should only set suppressNulls if the default is null.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not set suppressNulls to true in the else case, but instead rely on the valueToSuppress to determine suppression.\n\nWait, let's think about the code flow:\n\nIn the NON_DEFAULT case:\n\n- If _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, get the default value from the property. If the default is null, then suppressNulls is set to true. Otherwise, valueToSuppress is the default, and during serialization, if the property's value equals this default, it's suppressed.\n\n- If _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, get the default value from the type, and set suppressNulls to true. This causes any null property to be suppressed, regardless of the default.\n\nBut according to the inclusion logic, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the default is the type's default (e.g., null for objects). So if the property is null, it's equal to the default, so it should be suppressed. But if the default is non-null, and the property is null, it should be included.\n\nWait, no. Because when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the default is the type's default. So for objects, default is null. So if the property is null, it's equal to the default, so it's suppressed. If the default is non-null (e.g., for a primitive), then the property being null is impossible because primitives can't be null. So perhaps the else case is correct.\n\nWait, but for objects, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the default is null. So if the property is null, it's equal to the default, so it's suppressed. That's correct.\n\nBut the bug is that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it's not being suppressed. So perhaps the issue is that in some cases, the code is not correctly setting valueToSuppress to null, leading to suppressNulls not being set correctly.\n\nWait, looking back at the code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, after getting valueToSuppress, it does:\n\nif (valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n} else {\n    if (valueToSuppress.getClass().isArray()) {\n        valueToSuppress = ArrayBuilders.getArrayComparator(valueToSuppress);\n    }\n}\n\nSo if the default value is null, suppressNulls is set to true. That would cause the property to be suppressed if it's null.\n\nBut if the default is non-null, then valueToSuppress is non-null, and suppressNulls remains false. So during serialization, if the property is null, it would not be suppressed because suppressNulls is false. That's correct because, in that case, the property is null, which is different from the default, so it should be included.\n\nWait, but that's the opposite of what the bug is. The bug is that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it's not being suppressed. So perhaps the code is not correctly setting suppressNulls when the default is null.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the default is null, valueToSuppress is null, so suppressNulls is set to true. That would cause the property to be suppressed if it's null, which is correct.\n\nBut maybe in some cases, the code is not correctly getting the default value. For example, if the property is null, but the default is also null, then valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is true, so the property is suppressed. That's correct.\n\nBut the bug report says that the function is not correctly handling the case where the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. So perhaps the issue is that when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code is not correctly determining the default value, leading to suppressNulls not being set correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the property is null, and the default is non-null. But according to the inclusion logic, that should be included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code is not correctly setting valueToSuppress to the default, leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of an example.\n\nSuppose we have a property with a default value of \"default\". The inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. If the property is null, then it's different from the default, so it should be included. So in this case, the code should not suppress it.\n\nIn the code, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, it sets valueToSuppress to the type's default, which for objects is null. So valueToSuppress is null, which causes suppressNulls to be set to true. So the property would be suppressed if it's null, which is incorrect because the default is \"default\", not null.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in this case, the code is using the type's default (null) instead of the property's default (\"default\"). So when the property is null, it's being suppressed because the code thinks the default is null, but in reality, the property's default is \"default\".\n\nSo the issue is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default instead of the property's default. Therefore, in cases where the property has a non-null default, the code incorrectly uses the type's default (null), leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nSo the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code uses the property's default value, not the type's default, unless it's impossible to get the property's default.\n\nWait, but the code already has a section where if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it uses the property's default. Else, it uses the type's default.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code is using the type's default, which may not match the property's default, leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nSo to fix this, perhaps the code should always use the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults.\n\nBut that might not be feasible because _useRealPropertyDefaults is a feature that may not be enabled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should set suppressNulls based on whether the property is null and the inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the fix is to modify the getPropertyDefaultValue function to return null when the value is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT. But since I'm working within the buildWriter function, I need to adjust how valueToSuppress is determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the NON_DEFAULT case, after determining valueToSuppress, if the property is null, we should set suppressNulls to true only if the default is null.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should set suppressNulls to true only when the default is null, regardless of the property's value.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for where the problem occurs.\n\nThe bug report says that when the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the function is not correctly suppressing it. So perhaps in the code, when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code is not setting suppressNulls correctly.\n\nLooking at the code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, if _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, it gets the property's default. If the default is null, suppressNulls is set to true. If the default is non-null, suppressNulls remains false.\n\nIf _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, it gets the type's default, which for objects is null, so suppressNulls is set to true.\n\nSo in the case where _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, and the type's default is null, suppressNulls is true, so the property is suppressed if it's null.\n\nBut if the property's default is non-null, but _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default (null), leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nSo the problem is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default, which may not match the property's default, leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nSo to fix this, perhaps the code should always use the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults.\n\nBut that might not be possible because _useRealPropertyDefaults is a feature that may be disabled for performance reasons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should adjust how suppressNulls is set based on whether the property's value is null and the inclusion is NON_DEFAULT.\n\nWait, perhaps the fix is to set suppressNulls to true if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and the property is null, but that might not be correct in all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the property is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and then determine whether to suppress based on the default.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement that within the current code structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code should always suppress it if the default is null, but include it if the default is non-null.\n\nSo in the buildWriter function, after determining valueToSuppress, perhaps we should set suppressNulls to (valueToSuppress == null).\n\nBut looking at the code, it already does that. If valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is set to true.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that when the property is null, and the default is non-null, the code is not correctly including it.\n\nWait, let's think of an example:\n\nProperty default is \"default\", inclusion is NON_DEFAULT.\n\nIf the property is null, then it's different from the default, so it should be included.\n\nIn the code, when _useRealPropertyDefaults is true, valueToSuppress is \"default\". So valueToSuppress is not null, so suppressNulls remains false. So during serialization, if the property is null, it's not equal to \"default\", so it's included. That's correct.\n\nBut if _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default, which is null. So valueToSuppress is null, suppressNulls is set to true. So during serialization, if the property is null, it's suppressed. That's incorrect because the property's default is \"default\", not null.\n\nSo the problem is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default instead of the property's default, leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nSo the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code uses the property's default value, not the type's default, unless it's impossible.\n\nBut how can we do that? Because when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default.\n\nSo perhaps the fix is to modify the code so that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, it always uses the property's default, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults.\n\nBut that might have performance implications because _useRealPropertyDefaults is a feature that can be enabled or disabled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and, in that case, always use the property's default.\n\nSo in the code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults, it should get the property's default.\n\nBut that might not be feasible because when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code may not have access to the property's default.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be modified to always get the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and only fall back to the type's default if the property's default cannot be determined.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to modify the getPropertyDefaultValue function to return null when the value is null and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, as per the suggestion.\n\nWait, the suggestion says to modify getPropertyDefaultValue to return null when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and value is null. So perhaps in the buildWriter function, when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and the property is null, the default value is considered null, leading to suppression.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would fix the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to adjust how suppressNulls is set. For example, in the NON_DEFAULT case, set suppressNulls to true if the default is null, and the property is null.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code correctly determines whether the property should be suppressed based on whether its value is equal to the default.\n\nSo in the code, valueToSuppress is set to the default value. Then, during serialization, the property is suppressed if its value is equal to valueToSuppress.\n\nSo the problem is that when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code uses the type's default, which may not match the property's default, leading to incorrect suppression.\n\nSo the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code uses the property's default, not the type's default, unless it's impossible.\n\nBut how can we do that within the current code structure?\n\nPerhaps the code should always use the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults.\n\nSo in the NON_DEFAULT case, the code should set valueToSuppress to the property's default, not the type's default.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nIn the NON_DEFAULT case, remove the else clause that uses getDefaultValue(actualType), and always use getPropertyDefaultValue.\n\nBut that might not be possible because when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code may not be able to get the property's default.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and in that case, always get the property's default, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults.\n\nSo modifying the code as follows:\n\nIn the NON_DEFAULT case:\n\nif (inclusion == NON_DEFAULT) {\n    // Always get property default for NON_DEFAULT inclusion\n    valueToSuppress = getPropertyDefaultValue(propDef.getName(), am, actualType);\n    if (valueToSuppress == null) {\n        suppressNulls = true;\n    } else {\n        if (valueToSuppress.getClass().isArray()) {\n            valueToSuppress = ArrayBuilders.getArrayComparator(valueToSuppress);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBut that might not be correct because when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false, the code may not be able to get the property's default.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should only use the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and _useRealPropertyDefaults is true.\n\nBut that doesn't solve the problem when _useRealPropertyDefaults is false.\n\nHmm, perhaps the root cause is that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT and the property is null, the code is not correctly determining whether to suppress it based on the property's default.\n\nSo the fix is to ensure that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code uses the property's default, not the type's default.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the code should be modified to always get the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, regardless of _useRealPropertyDefaults.\n\nSo in the code, in the NON_DEFAULT case, remove the else clause and always call getPropertyDefaultValue.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should set valueToSuppress to the property's default when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, and only use the type's default if the property's default cannot be obtained.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to modify the code so that when inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, suppressNulls is set to true only if the default is null.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the property is null, and inclusion is NON_DEFAULT, the code is not correctly setting suppressNulls based on the default value.\n\nSo perhaps the fix is to adjust",
