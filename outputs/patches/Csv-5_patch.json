      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `format.getRecordSeparator()` method is returning 'null' because the `recordSeparator` field in the `CSVFormat` class is not being initialized correctly when the `withHeader` method is called. This is likely due to the fact that the `withHeader` method does not update the `recordSeparator` field.\nSuggestion: Initialize Record Separator in withHeader Method\nThe `withHeader` method should be updated to initialize the `recordSeparator` field with the correct value. This can be done by adding a line to set the `recordSeparator` field to the correct value. However, since we are not allowed to modify the class or add new functions, we can modify the buggy function to handle this case.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void println() throws IOException {\n    final String recordSeparator = format.getRecordSeparator();\n        out.append(recordSeparator);\n    newRecord = true;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is likely due to the fact that the `withHeader` method does not update the `recordSeparator` field.\nSuggestion: Update println Method to Handle Null Record Separator\nThe `println` method can be updated to handle the case where the `recordSeparator` field is 'null'. This can be done by adding a null check and using a default record separator if the field is 'null'. The default record separator can be the delimiter used in the CSV format.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void println() throws IOException {\n    final String recordSeparator = format.getRecordSeparator();\n        out.append(recordSeparator);\n    newRecord = true;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is likely due to the fact that the `withHeader` method does not update the `recordSeparator` field.\nSuggestion: Use Delimiter as Record Separator if Not Set\nThe `println` method can be updated to use the delimiter as the record separator if the `recordSeparator` field is 'null'. This can be done by adding a null check and using the delimiter if the field is 'null'. This solution is more straightforward and does not require defining a default record separator. \n\nHere is the modified buggy function based on\n// Buggy Function\npublic void println() throws IOException {\n    final String recordSeparator = format.getRecordSeparator();\n        out.append(recordSeparator);\n    newRecord = true;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
