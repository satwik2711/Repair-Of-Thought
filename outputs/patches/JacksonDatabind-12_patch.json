      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `isCachable()` function is not correctly determining whether an instance can be cached or not. The function is only checking if the `_valueTypeDeserializer` and `_ignorableProperties` are null, but it's not considering the case where a custom deserializer is used. In this case, the custom deserializer is modifying the value of `bean.map2.get(\"a\")` to 100, which is causing the assertion to fail.\nSuggestion: Check for Custom Deserializers\nThe `isCachable()` function should check if a custom deserializer is used. If a custom deserializer is used, the instance should not be cached. This can be done by adding a check for the presence of a custom deserializer in the `isCachable()` function. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic boolean isCachable() {\n    return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)\n            && (_ignorableProperties == null)\n            && !hasCustomDeserializer();\n}\n\nprivate boolean hasCustomDeserializer() {\n    // implementation to check for custom deserializers\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean isCachable() {\n    /* As per [databind#735], existence of value or key deserializer (only passed\n     * if annotated to use non-standard one) should also prevent caching.\n     */\n    return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)\n            && (_ignorableProperties == null);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

In this case, the custom deserializer is modifying the value of `bean.map2.get(\"a\")` to 100, which is causing the assertion to fail.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Caching Strategy\nInstead of caching the instance, we can use a different caching strategy that takes into account the use of custom deserializers. For example, we can cache the deserialized values instead of the instance itself. This would require significant changes to the caching mechanism, but it would ensure that the caching works correctly even when custom deserializers are used.\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean isCachable() {\n    /* As per [databind#735], existence of value or key deserializer (only passed\n     * if annotated to use non-standard one) should also prevent caching.\n     */\n    return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)\n            && (_ignorableProperties == null);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
