      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `remove` function is case-sensitive when checking for the property to be removed, whereas the `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` test case is designed to test case-insensitive properties. This mismatch in case sensitivity causes the property 'businessAddress' to not be found, resulting in the `NoSuchElementException`.\nSuggestion: Use Case-Insensitive Comparison\nOne possible fix is to use a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the property to be removed exists. We can use the `equalsIgnoreCase` method instead of the `equals` method to compare the property names. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, matching the behavior of the `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` test case. The updated code would be: `found = key.equalsIgnoreCase(prop.getName());`\n// Buggy Function\npublic void remove(SettableBeanProperty propToRm)\n{\n    ArrayList<SettableBeanProperty> props = new ArrayList<SettableBeanProperty>(_size);\n    String key = getPropertyName(propToRm);\n    boolean found = false;\n\n    for (int i = 1, end = _hashArea.length; i < end; i += 2) {\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = (SettableBeanProperty) _hashArea[i];\n        if (prop == null) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (!found) {\n            // 09-Jan-2017, tatu: Important: must check name slot and NOT property name,\n            //   as only former is lower-case in case-insensitive case\n            found = key.equals(prop.getName());\n            if (found) {\n                // need to leave a hole here\n                _propsInOrder[_findFromOrdered(prop)] = null;\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n        props.add(prop);\n    }\n    if (!found) {\n        throw new NoSuchElementException(\"No entry '\"+propToRm.getName()+\"' found, can't remove\");\n    }\n    init(props);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This mismatch in case sensitivity causes the property 'businessAddress' to not be found, resulting in the `NoSuchElementException`.\nSuggestion: Normalize Property Names\nAnother possible fix is to normalize the property names to a standard case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, regardless of the case of the property names. We can use the `toLowerCase` method to normalize the property names. The updated code would be: `found = key.equals(prop.getName().toLowerCase());` and `key = getPropertyName(propToRm).toLowerCase();`\n// Buggy Function\npublic void remove(SettableBeanProperty propToRm)\n{\n    ArrayList<SettableBeanProperty> props = new ArrayList<SettableBeanProperty>(_size);\n    String key = getPropertyName(propToRm);\n    boolean found = false;\n\n    for (int i = 1, end = _hashArea.length; i < end; i += 2) {\n        SettableBeanProperty prop = (SettableBeanProperty) _hashArea[i];\n        if (prop == null) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (!found) {\n            // 09-Jan-2017, tatu: Important: must check name slot and NOT property name,\n            //   as only former is lower-case in case-insensitive case\n            found = key.equals(prop.getName());\n            if (found) {\n                // need to leave a hole here\n                _propsInOrder[_findFromOrdered(prop)] = null;\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n        props.add(prop);\n    }\n    if (!found) {\n        throw new NoSuchElementException(\"No entry '\"+propToRm.getName()+\"' found, can't remove\");\n    }\n    init(props);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This will ensure that the property is retrieved in a case-insensitive manner, matching the behavior of the `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` test case.
