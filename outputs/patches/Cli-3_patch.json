      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the issue is likely due to the fact that the createNumber function in the buggy code returns a Number object, which can be either a Long or a Double, depending on the input string. However, the test case is expecting a Double object with the value 4.5. The issue is likely due to the fact that the createNumber function is returning a Long object instead of a Double object, which is causing the comparison to fail.\nSuggestion: Modify the createNumber Function to Always Return a Double\nOne possible fix is to modify the createNumber function to always return a Double object, regardless of whether the input string contains a decimal point or not. This can be done by changing the return statement to return Double.parseDouble(str); This will ensure that the function always returns a Double object, which should fix the issue.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static Number createNumber(String str)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            return NumberUtils.createNumber(str);\n        }\n        catch (NumberFormatException nfe)\n        {\n            System.err.println(nfe.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The issue is likely due to the fact that the createNumber function is returning a Long object instead of a Double object, which is causing the comparison to fail.\nSuggestion: Modify the Test Case to Compare the Values Correctly\nAnother possible fix is to modify the test case to compare the values correctly. Instead of comparing the actual value to a Double object with the value 4.5, the test case could compare the actual value to a Number object with the value 4.5. This can be done by changing the assertion statement to assertEquals(\\\"number flag n\\\", 4.5, line.getOptionObject(\\\"n\\\").doubleValue()); This will ensure that the comparison is done correctly, regardless of whether the actual value is a Long or a Double.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static Number createNumber(String str)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            return NumberUtils.createNumber(str);\n        }\n        catch (NumberFormatException nfe)\n        {\n            System.err.println(nfe.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This can be done by checking whether the input string contains a decimal point, and if so, returning a Double object, otherwise returning a Long object.
