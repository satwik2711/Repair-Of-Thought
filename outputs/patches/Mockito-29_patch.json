      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `NullPointerException` is thrown because the `wanted` object is `null` when the `describeTo` method is called. This happens when the `same` method is called with a `null` argument. The `describeTo` method does not handle the case where `wanted` is `null`, resulting in a `NullPointerException` when it tries to call `toString()` on the `wanted` object.\nSuggestion: Check for Null Before Calling toString()\nWe can add a null check before calling `toString()` on the `wanted` object. This will prevent the `NullPointerException` from being thrown. Here's the modified code:\n```java\npublic void describeTo(Description description) {\n    description.appendText(\"same(\");\n    appendQuoting(description);\n    if (wanted != null) {\n        description.appendText(wanted.toString());\n    } else {\n        description.appendText(\"null\");\n    }\n    appendQuoting(description);\n    description.appendText(\")\");\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, but it may not be the most elegant solution.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void describeTo(Description description) {\n    description.appendText(\"same(\");\n    appendQuoting(description);\n    description.appendText(wanted.toString());\n    appendQuoting(description);\n    description.appendText(\")\");\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The `describeTo` method does not handle the case where `wanted` is `null`, resulting in a `NullPointerException` when it tries to call `toString()` on the `wanted` object.\nSuggestion: Use Optional.toString()\nWe can use the `Optional` class to handle the case where `wanted` is `null`.
