      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `unixTimeToZipLong` checks if the input value is greater than or equal to `2^32`, but it does not check if the input value is greater than or equal to `2^32 - 1`. This is because the maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer is `2^32 - 1`, not `2^32`. As a result, when the input value is `2^32`, the function throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, even though the value can be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer.\nSuggestion: Update the Check for 32-bit Unsigned Integer\nWe can update the check in the function `unixTimeToZipLong` to check if the input value is greater than or equal to `2^32 - 1`, instead of `2^32`. This will ensure that the function does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when the input value is `2^32`. The updated function would be:\n```java\nprivate static ZipLong unixTimeToZipLong(long l) {\n    final long TWO_TO_32_MINUS_ONE = 0xFFFFFFFFL;\n    if (l >= TWO_TO_32_MINUS_ONE) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"X5455 timestamps must fit in a signed 32 bit integer: \" + l);\n    }\n    return new ZipLong(l);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static ZipLong unixTimeToZipLong(long l) {\n    final long TWO_TO_32 = 0x100000000L;\n    if (l >= TWO_TO_32) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"X5455 timestamps must fit in a signed 32 bit integer: \" + l);\n    }\n    return new ZipLong(l);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

As a result, when the input value is `2^32`, the function throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, even though the value can be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer.\nSuggestion: Use a Larger Data Type\nAnother potential fix is to use a larger data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to represent the `ZipLong` value. This will allow the function to handle larger input values without throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. However, this solution may require additional changes to the surrounding code to accommodate the larger data type.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static ZipLong unixTimeToZipLong(long l) {\n    final long TWO_TO_32 = 0x100000000L;\n    if (l >= TWO_TO_32) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"X5455 timestamps must fit in a signed 32 bit integer: \" + l);\n    }\n    return new ZipLong(l);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

As a result, when the input value is `2^32`, the function throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, even though the value can be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer.\nSuggestion: Handle the Edge Case\nWe can also handle the edge case where the input value is `2^32` by adding a special check for this value. If the input value is `2^32`, we can return a special value, such as `null`, to indicate that the value is too big to be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer. This solution is more complex and may require additional error handling, but it provides a way to handle the edge case without changing the underlying data type.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static ZipLong unixTimeToZipLong(long l) {\n    final long TWO_TO_32 = 0x100000000L;\n    if (l >= TWO_TO_32) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"X5455 timestamps must fit in a signed 32 bit integer: \" + l);\n    }\n    return new ZipLong(l);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
