      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the `read()` method of the buggy function. The condition `if (current == '\\n')` checks if the current character is a newline character (`'\\n'`), but it does not account for the case where the line separator is `'\\r'`. As a result, when the line separator is `'\\r'`, the line counter is not incremented correctly, leading to the incorrect line number.\nSuggestion: Check for Both Newline Characters\nOne possible fix is to modify the condition in the `read()` method to check for both `'\\\\n'` and `'\\\\r'` newline characters. This can be done by changing the condition to `if (current == '\\\\n' || current == '\\\\r')`. This will ensure that the line counter is incremented correctly regardless of the line separator used.\n// Buggy Function\npublic int read() throws IOException {\n    int current = super.read();\n    if (current == '\\n') {\n        lineCounter++;\n    }\n    lastChar = current;\n    return lastChar;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

As a result, when the line separator is `'\\r'`, the line counter is not incremented correctly, leading to the incorrect line number.\nSuggestion: Use the `CSVFormat` Line Separator\nA second possible fix is to use the line separator specified in the `CSVFormat` object. We can access the line separator using the `getLineSeparator()` method and use it to check if the current character is a newline character. This will ensure that the line counter is incremented correctly based on the line separator specified in the `CSVFormat` object.\n// Buggy Function\npublic int read() throws IOException {\n    int current = super.read();\n    if (current == '\\n') {\n        lineCounter++;\n    }\n    lastChar = current;\n    return lastChar;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

As a result, when the line separator is `'\\r'`, the line counter is not incremented correctly, leading to the incorrect line number.\nSuggestion: Use a More Robust Line Separator Detection\nA third possible fix is to use a more robust line separator detection mechanism. Instead of hardcoding the newline characters, we can use a regular expression to match the line separator. For example, we can use the `String.matches()` method to check if the current character matches the line separator pattern. This will provide more flexibility and accuracy in detecting the line separator.\n// Buggy Function\npublic int read() throws IOException {\n    int current = super.read();\n    if (current == '\\n') {\n        lineCounter++;\n    }\n    lastChar = current;\n    return lastChar;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
