      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `captureArgumentsFrom` method does not check if the `getArguments()` method returns an empty array before trying to access its elements. This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the method tries to access the first element of the empty array.\nSuggestion: Check for Empty Array\nOne potential fix is to add a check at the beginning of the `captureArgumentsFrom` method to see if the `getArguments()` method returns an empty array. If it does, the method can return immediately without trying to access any elements. This fix is simple and effective, and it ensures that the method does not try to access an empty array.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation i) {\n    int k = 0;\n    for (Matcher m : matchers) {\n        if (m instanceof CapturesArguments) {\n            ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(i.getArguments()[k]);\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the method tries to access the first element of the empty array.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Indexing Approach\nAnother potential fix is to use a different indexing approach. Instead of using a separate index variable `k`, the method could use the index of the matcher in the `matchers` list to access the corresponding argument. This would eliminate the need for the separate index variable and avoid the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. However, this fix may require additional changes to the method's logic.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation i) {\n    int k = 0;\n    for (Matcher m : matchers) {\n        if (m instanceof CapturesArguments) {\n            ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(i.getArguments()[k]);\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This causes an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the method tries to access the first element of the empty array.\nSuggestion: Validate Matcher Count\nA third potential fix is to validate the count of matchers before trying to access the arguments. If the count of matchers is greater than the number of arguments, the method can throw an exception or return an error message. This fix ensures that the method does not try to access an argument that does not exist, but it may require additional error handling code.\n\nHere is the debugged code for\n// Buggy Function\npublic void captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation i) {\n    int k = 0;\n    for (Matcher m : matchers) {\n        if (m instanceof CapturesArguments) {\n            ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(i.getArguments()[k]);\n        }\n        k++;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
