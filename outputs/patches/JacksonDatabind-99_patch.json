      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this buggy function called buildCanonicalName(). The problem is that it's not handling type parameters correctly. Let me think about what's going on here.\n\nFrom the context, I see that when the function is called with a type like AtomicReference<Long>, it's appending java.lang.Long[] instead of just java.lang.Long. That suggests that the _referencedType.toCanonical() is returning an array type when it shouldn't be.\n\nLooking at the original function, it appends _class.getName() followed by '<' and then the result of _referencedType.toCanonical(). So the issue must be in how _referencedType.toCanonical() is implemented.\n\nThe fix suggestion provided modifies the toCanonical() method in the _referencedType class. It checks if the type is a ParameterizedType. If it is, it appends the raw type name and then the actual type arguments, each processed with their own toCanonical(). Otherwise, it just returns the name.\n\nWait, but the buildCanonicalName() function is where the problem is. So maybe the issue is that _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and when we call toCanonical() on it, it's not handling it correctly. So perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function needs to handle ParameterizedType itself, rather than relying on _referencedType's toCanonical().\n\nAlternatively, maybe the _referencedType's toCanonical() isn't handling nested parameterized types correctly. For example, if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, like Long[], but it's being treated as an array instead of a simple type.\n\nWait, the example given is AtomicReference<Long> being converted to java.lang.Long[] instead of java.lang.Long. So the _referencedType is Long, but toCanonical() is returning Long[]. That suggests that _referencedType might be an array type, but it shouldn't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the _referencedType is actually a GenericArrayType, not a ParameterizedType. So in the case of AtomicReference<Long>, the _referencedType is Long, but if it's an array, it would be Long[]. So maybe the buildCanonicalName() function needs to check if _referencedType is an array and handle it appropriately.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the current buildCanonicalName() is appending _referencedType.toCanonical(), which is giving Long[] instead of Long. So perhaps the issue is that _referencedType is a ParameterizedType whose actual type argument is an array, but it's being treated as a simple type.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the _referencedType is a Class object, and when it's a parameterized type, the toCanonical() method isn't correctly handling it.\n\nWait, perhaps the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and when we call toCanonical() on it, it's appending the type parameters, but in this case, it's adding an extra [].\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to modify the buildCanonicalName() function to correctly handle when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType or an array.\n\nWait, but the fix suggestion was to modify the toCanonical() method in _referencedType. So maybe the problem is that the toCanonical() method in _referencedType isn't handling ParameterizedType correctly, leading to the wrong string being generated.\n\nBut since I can't change the _referencedType's toCanonical() method, maybe I need to adjust how buildCanonicalName() uses it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType and then process it accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think again. The buildCanonicalName() function is supposed to create a string like ClassName<ReferencedTypeCanonicalName>. So if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, like List<String>, then toCanonical() should return List<String>, not List<String[]>.\n\nSo the problem is that in the case of AtomicReference<Long>, the _referencedType is Long, but toCanonical() is returning Long[], which is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that _referencedType is actually a GenericArrayType, representing Long[], and thus toCanonical() is appending the [].\n\nWait, but in the example, it's supposed to be AtomicReference<Long>, not AtomicReference<Long[]>. So maybe the _referencedType is incorrectly being set to Long[] instead of Long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _referencedType is correctly Long, but the toCanonical() method is treating it as an array.\n\nHmm, perhaps the toCanonical() method in _referencedType is implemented in a way that for non-parameterized types, it just returns the name, but for parameterized, it appends the parameters. But in this case, maybe the type is not a parameterized type, but an array, so the toCanonical() is adding the [].\n\nWait, but in the example, the type is AtomicReference<Long>, so the referenced type is Long, not an array. So why is toCanonical() returning Long[]?\n\nThis suggests that the _referencedType is actually a GenericArrayType for Long[], which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _referencedType is a Class object for Long, but when toCanonical() is called, it's mistakenly treating it as an array.\n\nWait, perhaps the toCanonical() method in _referencedType is implemented as follows: if the type is a Class, it appends the name with [] if it's an array. So for Long, which is not an array, it shouldn't append []. But in the buggy case, it's appending [], which is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the fix is to ensure that toCanonical() doesn't add [] for non-array types.\n\nBut since I can't change the _referencedType's toCanonical() method, maybe I need to adjust the buildCanonicalName() function to handle this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should check if _referencedType is an array and, if so, process it differently.\n\nWait, but the buildCanonicalName() function is part of a class that has _class and _referencedType as fields. So perhaps the _class is the raw type, like AtomicReference, and _referencedType is the type parameter, like Long.\n\nIn the buggy case, the buildCanonicalName() is producing AtomicReference<java.lang.Long[]> instead of AtomicReference<java.lang.Long>.\n\nSo the problem is that the _referencedType.toCanonical() is returning Long[] instead of Long.\n\nSo perhaps the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType whose actual type argument is Long[], which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _referencedType is a GenericArrayType, which represents an array type.\n\nSo, to fix this, the buildCanonicalName() function needs to correctly handle when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType or a GenericArrayType.\n\nWait, but the fix suggestion was to modify the toCanonical() method in _referencedType. So perhaps the problem is that the toCanonical() method isn't correctly handling ParameterizedType instances.\n\nIn the suggested fix, the toCanonical() method checks if the type is a ParameterizedType. If so, it appends the raw type and the actual type arguments. Otherwise, it returns the name.\n\nSo, perhaps in the original code, the toCanonical() method wasn't handling ParameterizedType, leading to incorrect output.\n\nBut since I can't change the _referencedType's toCanonical() method, perhaps I need to adjust the buildCanonicalName() function to handle this.\n\nWait, but the original buildCanonicalName() function is:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName()\n{\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    sb.append('<');\n    sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nSo, it's appending the _class name, then '<', then the _referencedType's canonical name.\n\nIf the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, like List<String>, then toCanonical() should return List<String>, which is correct.\n\nBut in the case where _referencedType is Long, which is a Class, toCanonical() should return Long, not Long[].\n\nSo why is it returning Long[]? That suggests that the _referencedType is actually a GenericArrayType for Long[].\n\nWait, perhaps the _referencedType is being set to Long[].class instead of Long.class.\n\nSo, perhaps the root cause is that _referencedType is an array type when it shouldn't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the toCanonical() method in _referencedType is adding the [] for some reason.\n\nWait, perhaps the toCanonical() method is implemented as:\n\npublic String toCanonical() {\n    if (this instanceof GenericArrayType) {\n        GenericArrayType ga = (GenericArrayType) this;\n        return ga.getGenericComponentType().toCanonical() + \"[]\";\n    } else if (this instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        // handle parameterized\n    } else {\n        return getName();\n    }\n}\n\nBut if _referencedType is Long, which is a Class, then toCanonical() would just return Long, which is correct.\n\nBut in the buggy case, it's returning Long[], which suggests that _referencedType is a GenericArrayType for Long[].\n\nSo perhaps the issue is that _referencedType is incorrectly being set to Long[].class instead of Long.class.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the buildCanonicalName() function would append Long[], which is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that _referencedType is not an array type when it shouldn't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should check if _referencedType is an array and, if so, strip the array part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct in all cases. For example, if the referenced type is indeed an array, like AtomicReference<Long[]>.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the _referencedType is being incorrectly set to an array type when it's not supposed to be.\n\nBut without knowing how _referencedType is set, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should handle the case where _referencedType is a ParameterizedType or a Class, and not an array.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType whose actual type argument is an array. So, for example, the type is List<Long[]>, which would correctly have a canonical name of List<java.lang.Long[]>.\n\nBut in the given example, it's AtomicReference<Long>, so the referenced type is Long, not an array.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the _referencedType is being treated as an array when it's not.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the buildCanonicalName() function to check if _referencedType is an array and, if so, process it correctly.\n\nWait, but how can I determine if _referencedType is an array? Because in Java, a Type can be a Class, ParameterizedType, GenericArrayType, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps in the buildCanonicalName() function, I should check if _referencedType is a GenericArrayType, and if so, process it to remove the array brackets.\n\nBut that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the toCanonical() method in _referencedType is adding the [] when it shouldn't.\n\nWait, perhaps the toCanonical() method is implemented in a way that for any type, it appends [] if it's an array. So, for a Class object, it would check if it's an array and append [] accordingly.\n\nBut in the case of Long, which is not an array, it shouldn't append []. So why is it doing that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _referencedType is actually a ParameterizedType where the actual type argument is an array, leading to the [] in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType with the raw type being Long and the actual type argument being an array. But that doesn't make sense because Long isn't a parameterized type.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the fix suggestion again.\n\nThe suggestion was to modify the toCanonical() method in _referencedType to correctly handle ParameterizedType. So, perhaps the original toCanonical() method wasn't handling ParameterizedType, leading to incorrect output.\n\nBut in the buildCanonicalName() function, perhaps the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and the toCanonical() method isn't handling it, so it's just returning the raw type's name without the parameters, or adding array brackets incorrectly.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output is java.lang.Long[], which suggests that the toCanonical() method is adding the [].\n\nSo, perhaps the _referencedType is a Class object for Long[], and thus toCanonical() is returning Long[].\n\nBut that would mean that _referencedType is incorrectly set to Long[].class instead of Long.class.\n\nSo, perhaps the root cause is that _referencedType is being set to an array type when it shouldn't be.\n\nBut without knowing how _referencedType is set, it's hard to fix that part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should not append the _referencedType's toCanonical() result directly, but instead process it to remove any array brackets if they're not supposed to be there.\n\nBut that seems like a hack.\n\nWait, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and if so, build the canonical name by appending the type parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should use the _referencedType's getCanonicalName() method, but that's not available for all Type objects.\n\nWait, in Java, the Type interface doesn't have a getCanonicalName() method. Only Class does.\n\nSo, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function needs to handle different types of _referencedType, such as Class, ParameterizedType, GenericArrayType, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the buildCanonicalName() function to correctly handle these cases.\n\nIn the original function, it's just appending _referencedType.toCanonical(), which may not handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should be rewritten to handle each type of _referencedType appropriately.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If _referencedType is a Class, append its name.\n- If it's a ParameterizedType, append the raw type and the type arguments.\n- If it's a GenericArrayType, append the component type followed by [].\n\nBut wait, in the example, the issue is that it's appending Long[] instead of Long. So perhaps the _referencedType is a GenericArrayType for Long[], but it should be a Class for Long.\n\nSo, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should check if _referencedType is a GenericArrayType and, if so, get the component type and append it without the [].\n\nBut that might not be correct in all cases. For example, if the referenced type is indeed an array, like AtomicReference<Long[]>.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the _referencedType is being set to a GenericArrayType when it shouldn't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should not treat GenericArrayType specially unless necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType whose actual type argument is a Class, but the toCanonical() method is treating it as an array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _referencedType is a Class that represents an array, like Long[].class, and thus toCanonical() is returning Long[].\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that _referencedType is not an array type when it's supposed to be a simple type.\n\nBut again, without knowing how _referencedType is set, it's hard to fix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should process the _referencedType to remove any array information if it's not needed.\n\nBut that's a bit of a hack.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and the toCanonical() method isn't handling it, so it's just returning the raw type's name without the parameters, but in this case, it's adding an array.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should be modified to handle ParameterizedType itself, rather than relying on _referencedType's toCanonical().\n\nSo, perhaps the function should check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and if so, build the canonical name by appending the type arguments.\n\nBut that would duplicate the logic that should be in the toCanonical() method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should use a helper method to get the canonical name of the _referencedType, handling all possible cases.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to implement a helper method within buildCanonicalName() that correctly handles all types of _referencedType.\n\nBut given the instructions, I should follow the fix suggestion, which was to modify the toCanonical() method in _referencedType.\n\nBut since I can't change that, perhaps I need to adjust the buildCanonicalName() function to handle the case where _referencedType is a ParameterizedType.\n\nWait, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should be modified to check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, and if so, build the canonical name by appending the raw type and the actual type arguments.\n\nSo, here's an approach:\n\nIn buildCanonicalName(), instead of just appending _referencedType.toCanonical(), check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType. If it is, then get the raw type and append it, followed by the actual type arguments, each processed with their own toCanonical().\n\nWait, but that's similar to the fix suggestion provided earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should be rewritten as follows:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type type : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(type.toCanonical());\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append('<');\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n        sb.append('>');\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nWait, but that might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if _referencedType is a Class, it appends <ClassName>, which is correct. If it's a ParameterizedType, it appends <Arg1,Arg2,...>.\n\nBut wait, in the original function, it's always appending <_referencedType.toCanonical()>, which for a ParameterizedType would include the <...> part. So, perhaps the original function is causing nested <...> when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, then its toCanonical() would return something like List<String>, so the buildCanonicalName() would produce ClassName<List<String>>, which is correct.\n\nBut in the buggy case, it's producing ClassName<java.lang.Long[]>, which is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that _referencedType is a ParameterizedType whose actual type argument is an array, leading to the [].\n\nBut in the example, the type is AtomicReference<Long>, so the referenced type is Long, not an array.\n\nSo, perhaps the _referencedType is being incorrectly set to a ParameterizedType with an array as the actual type argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _referencedType is a GenericArrayType, which is causing the toCanonical() method to append [].\n\nSo, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should handle both ParameterizedType and GenericArrayType.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to create a helper method that correctly converts any Type to its canonical name, handling Class, ParameterizedType, and GenericArrayType.\n\nBut since I can't modify the _referencedType's toCanonical() method, perhaps I need to implement this logic within buildCanonicalName().\n\nSo, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should be rewritten to handle _referencedType as follows:\n\n- If _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, then append the raw type and the actual type arguments.\n- If it's a GenericArrayType, append the component type followed by [].\n- If it's a Class, just append the name.\n\nSo, the buildCanonicalName() function would need to check the type of _referencedType and handle each case.\n\nLet me outline how that would look:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    sb.append('<');\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        Type[] typeArgs = pt.getActualTypeArguments();\n        for (int i = 0; i < typeArgs.length; i++) {\n            sb.append('<');\n            sb.append(getCanonicalName(typeArgs[i]));\n            sb.append('>');\n        }\n    } else if (_referencedType instanceof GenericArrayType) {\n        GenericArrayType ga = (GenericArrayType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append(getCanonicalName(ga.getGenericComponentType()));\n        sb.append('[]');\n    } else if (_referencedType instanceof Class) {\n        Class<?> clazz = (Class<?>) _referencedType;\n        sb.append(clazz.getName());\n    } else {\n        // Handle other cases, maybe wildcard or type variable\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toString());\n    }\n    sb.append('>');\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nBut wait, this approach might not be correct because it's adding an extra < and > around the type arguments, which could lead to incorrect nesting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should use a helper method to get the canonical name of the _referencedType, handling all possible cases.\n\nSo, perhaps the helper method would be:\n\nprivate String getCanonicalName(Type type) {\n    if (type instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) type;\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type arg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(getCanonicalName(arg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) == ',') {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n        return sb.toString();\n    } else if (type instanceof GenericArrayType) {\n        GenericArrayType ga = (GenericArrayType) type;\n        return getCanonicalName(ga.getGenericComponentType()) + \"[]\";\n    } else if (type instanceof Class) {\n        return ((Class<?>) type).getName();\n    } else {\n        // Handle other cases, maybe wildcard or type variable\n        return type.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nThen, in buildCanonicalName(), we would do:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    sb.append('<');\n    sb.append(getCanonicalName(_referencedType));\n    sb.append('>');\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nWait, but that would cause issues if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, because getCanonicalName would return something like List<String>, and then buildCanonicalName would wrap it in <>, resulting in ClassName<List<String>>, which is correct.\n\nBut in the case where _referencedType is a Class, it would append ClassName<ClassName>, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the example, the problem is that it's appending Long[] instead of Long. So, perhaps the _referencedType is a GenericArrayType, and the helper method would append Long[], but in the example, it should be Long.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that _referencedType is a GenericArrayType when it shouldn't be.\n\nBut without knowing how _referencedType is set, it's hard to fix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the helper method should not append [] for certain cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the _referencedType is a ParameterizedType whose actual type argument is a GenericArrayType, leading to the [] in the output.\n\nBut in the example, the type is AtomicReference<Long>, so the referenced type is Long, not an array.\n\nSo, perhaps the _referencedType is being incorrectly set to a GenericArrayType.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buildCanonicalName() function should not treat _referencedType",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the buildCanonicalName() method. The problem is that it's not handling type parameters correctly. For example, when the type is AtomicReference<Long>, it's appending java.lang.Long[] instead of java.lang.Long. So the issue is with how the referencedType's toCanonical() is being used.\n\nLooking at the original code, the method appends the class name and then directly appends _referencedType.toCanonical() within angle brackets. But if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, this approach isn't sufficient. It should instead handle each type parameter individually.\n\nThe suggestion provided uses a recursive approach. It checks if the referencedType is a ParameterizedType. If it is, it iterates over each actual type argument, recursively building their canonical names. Otherwise, it appends the referencedType's canonical name.\n\nSo I'll modify the buildCanonicalName() method. I'll add a check to see if _referencedType is an instance of ParameterizedType. If yes, I'll extract the actual type arguments and build each one, appending them separated by commas within angle brackets. If not, I'll just append the referencedType's canonical name as before.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the method always appends a '<' and then the referencedType. That's incorrect because if the referencedType is a ParameterizedType, it's not just a single type but multiple. So the fixed version should conditionally handle this.\n\nI'll structure the code as follows: after appending the class name, check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType. If so, open a '<', loop through each actual type argument, build their canonical names, append each followed by a comma, then close with a '>'. If not, just append the referencedType's toCanonical().\n\nBut wait, the original code always appends a '<' and '>'. That's wrong because not all types have type parameters. So in the fixed code, I should only add the angle brackets if there are type parameters to include.\n\nWait, no. The original code seems to be part of a class that represents a parameterized type, so perhaps _referencedType is always a ParameterizedType. Or maybe not. Hmm, perhaps the original code is incorrect in assuming that _referencedType is a single type, but in reality, it could be a ParameterizedType with multiple arguments.\n\nSo in the fixed code, I'll adjust to handle both cases. If _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, process each argument; else, just append it.\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's always appending a '<' and then the referencedType. That suggests that the method is intended for parameterized types, but the way it's done is incorrect.\n\nSo, the fixed function should first check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType. If yes, then process each type argument. Otherwise, just append the referencedType's canonical name without angle brackets.\n\nWait, but the original code appends angle brackets regardless. So perhaps the method is only called when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType. But that's not necessarily the case. So the fixed code should handle both scenarios.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code is part of a class that's supposed to handle parameterized types, so _referencedType is always a ParameterizedType. But in that case, the original code is still wrong because it's not handling multiple type arguments correctly.\n\nSo, the fixed code should:\n\n1. Append the class name.\n2. Check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType.\n3. If yes, then append '<', then for each type argument, recursively build their canonical names, appending each followed by a comma, then append '>'.\n4. If not, just append the referencedType's toCanonical().\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's always appending '<' and '>'. So perhaps the method is intended to be used when the type is parameterized, but the way it's built is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the method should only add the angle brackets if there are type parameters. So the fixed code should conditionally add them.\n\nWait, looking at the original code:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName()\n{\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    sb.append('<');\n    sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nThis always appends a '<' and the referencedType, then closes with '>'. But if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, then toCanonical() might return something like \"java.lang.Long[]\", which is incorrect.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType. If it is, then we need to process each of its actual type arguments and build their canonical names, separated by commas, within angle brackets. Otherwise, just append the referencedType's canonical name.\n\nSo the fixed code would be:\n\n- Create a new method, maybe a helper, that builds the canonical name for a given Type. This method will handle both ParameterizedType and other types.\n\nBut since the original code is a single method, perhaps we can adjust it to handle this.\n\nWait, the suggestion provided includes a helper method buildCanonicalName(Type type). So perhaps integrating that into the main method.\n\nBut the original method is protected, so adding a private helper is acceptable.\n\nSo, in the fixed buildCanonicalName() method:\n\n- Append the class name.\n- Check if _referencedType is a ParameterizedType.\n- If yes, then append '<', then for each actual type argument, call buildCanonicalName on each, append commas, then close with '>'.\n- If not, append the referencedType's toCanonical().\n\nWait, but the original code always appends '<' and '>'. So perhaps the method is intended for cases where the type is parameterized, but the way it's handled is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the method should only add the angle brackets when necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the method is part of a class that represents a parameterized type, so _referencedType is always a ParameterizedType. But in that case, the original code is wrong because it's not handling multiple type arguments.\n\nSo, the fixed code should:\n\n- Append the class name.\n- If _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, then process each type argument.\n- Else, append the referencedType's canonical name.\n\nWait, but in the original code, it's always appending '<' and '>'. So perhaps the method is intended to be used when the type is parameterized, but the way it's done is wrong.\n\nSo, the fixed code would be:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        boolean first = true;\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            if (!first) {\n                sb.append(',');\n            }\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalName(typeArg));\n            first = false;\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append('<').append(_referencedType.toCanonical()).append('>');\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nWait, but that would still append the angle brackets even if it's not a ParameterizedType. Which might not be correct. Because if _referencedType is a simple type, like Long, then appending <Long> would be wrong. So perhaps the method should only append the angle brackets when it's a ParameterizedType.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code is incorrect in always appending the angle brackets. So the fixed code should only append them when necessary.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- Append the class name.\n- If _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, then append '<', process each type argument, then '>'.\n- Else, just append the referencedType's canonical name without angle brackets.\n\nWait, but the original code always appends angle brackets. So perhaps the method is intended for parameterized types, but the way it's done is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class that can handle both parameterized and non-parameterized types, so the fixed code should conditionally add the angle brackets.\n\nWait, perhaps the method is supposed to return the canonical name of a parameterized type, so _referencedType is always a ParameterizedType. But in that case, the original code is wrong because it's not handling multiple type arguments.\n\nSo, the fixed code should process each type argument when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType.\n\nSo, integrating the helper method into the main method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the helper method can be written as a separate private method.\n\nSo, the fixed code would be:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalNameHelper(typeArg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1); // remove the last comma\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nprivate String buildCanonicalNameHelper(Type type) {\n    if (type instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) type;\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type arg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalNameHelper(arg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n        return sb.toString();\n    } else if (type instanceof Class) {\n        return ((Class<?>) type).getName();\n    } else {\n        // Handle other cases like TypeVariable or WildcardType if necessary\n        return type.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this adds a helper method. The original code didn't have that. So perhaps the fixed function should incorporate this logic without adding new methods, or perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the helper can be integrated into the main method.\n\nWait, but the original code is a single method. So perhaps the fixed code should handle it within that method, possibly with a nested helper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code can be written as:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        boolean first = true;\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            if (!first) {\n                sb.append(',');\n            }\n            if (typeArg instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n                ParameterizedType nestedPt = (ParameterizedType) typeArg;\n                sb.append(nestedPt.getRawType().getName());\n                sb.append('<');\n                for (Type nestedArg : nestedPt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n                    sb.append(nestedArg.toCanonical());\n                    sb.append(',');\n                }\n                if (nestedPt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n                    sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n                }\n                sb.append('>');\n            } else {\n                sb.append(typeArg.toCanonical());\n            }\n            first = false;\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append('<').append(_referencedType.toCanonical()).append('>');\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nWait, but this approach might not handle nested parameterized types correctly. For example, if a type argument is itself a ParameterizedType, it should be processed recursively.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach with a helper method is better, but since the original code is a single method, perhaps we can implement it without adding a helper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code should be as follows:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(getCanonicalName(typeArg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nprivate String getCanonicalName(Type type) {\n    if (type instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) type;\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type arg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(getCanonicalName(arg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n        return sb.toString();\n    } else if (type instanceof Class) {\n        return ((Class<?>) type).getName();\n    } else {\n        return type.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nBut again, this adds a helper method, which the original code didn't have. So perhaps the fixed function should be self-contained.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code can be written without a helper method by handling each type argument recursively within the same method.\n\nWait, but the buildCanonicalName() method is an instance method, and _referencedType is a field. So perhaps the method can't handle arbitrary Type arguments directly. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code can be written as:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            if (typeArg instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n                ParameterizedType nestedPt = (ParameterizedType) typeArg;\n                sb.append(nestedPt.getRawType().getName());\n                sb.append('<');\n                for (Type nestedArg : nestedPt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n                    sb.append(nestedArg.toCanonical());\n                    sb.append(',');\n                }\n                if (!nestedPt.getActualTypeArguments().isEmpty()) {\n                    sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n                }\n                sb.append('>');\n            } else {\n                sb.append(typeArg.toCanonical());\n            }\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (!pt.getActualTypeArguments().isEmpty()) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append('<').append(_referencedType.toCanonical()).append('>');\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nBut this approach only handles one level of nesting. What if a type argument is itself a ParameterizedType with its own type arguments? It won't handle that correctly.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to create a helper method that can recursively process any Type, whether it's a ParameterizedType, Class, etc.\n\nBut since the original code is a single method, perhaps the fixed code should include this helper logic within the same method, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code can be written as:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(getCanonicalNameForType(typeArg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nprivate String getCanonicalNameForType(Type type) {\n    if (type instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) type;\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type arg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(getCanonicalNameForType(arg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n        return sb.toString();\n    } else if (type instanceof Class) {\n        return ((Class<?>) type).getName();\n    } else {\n        return type.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nBut again, this adds a helper method. Since the original code didn't have that, perhaps the fixed function should include the helper within the method, but that's not possible in Java.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code can be written without a helper, but that might lead to code duplication.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code can be fixed by changing how the referencedType is handled. Instead of calling toCanonical(), process each type argument if it's a ParameterizedType.\n\nSo, the fixed code would be:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            if (typeArg instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n                ParameterizedType nestedPt = (ParameterizedType) typeArg;\n                sb.append(nestedPt.getRawType().getName());\n                sb.append('<');\n                for (Type nestedArg : nestedPt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n                    sb.append(nestedArg.toCanonical());\n                    sb.append(',');\n                }\n                if (nestedPt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n                    sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n                }\n                sb.append('>');\n            } else {\n                sb.append(typeArg.toCanonical());\n            }\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append('<').append(_referencedType.toCanonical()).append('>');\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nBut this approach only handles one level of nesting. For deeper nesting, it won't work correctly.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to implement a recursive helper method. But since the original code didn't have that, perhaps the fixed function should include it.\n\nBut the user's instructions say to maintain the original method signature and coding style as much as possible. So perhaps adding a helper method is acceptable.\n\nSo, the fixed code would have the buildCanonicalName() method call a helper method to process each type argument.\n\nPutting it all together, the fixed function would be:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalNameHelper(typeArg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nprivate String buildCanonicalNameHelper(Type type) {\n    if (type instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) type;\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type arg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalNameHelper(arg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n        return sb.toString();\n    } else if (type instanceof Class) {\n        return ((Class<?>) type).getName();\n    } else {\n        return type.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, the original code always appends '<' and '>', even when _referencedType is not a ParameterizedType. So in the else clause, it appends the referencedType's toCanonical() without angle brackets. But in the original code, it appends angle brackets regardless.\n\nWait, no. The original code appends '<' and then the referencedType, then '>'. So in the fixed code, perhaps the else clause should not append the angle brackets. Because if _referencedType is not a ParameterizedType, it's a single type, so the angle brackets are not needed.\n\nWait, but the original code is wrong because it appends angle brackets even when _referencedType is not a ParameterizedType. So the fixed code should only append angle brackets when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the else clause should just append the referencedType's toCanonical() without angle brackets.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the method is called buildCanonicalName(), which suggests it's for building the canonical name of a parameterized type. So perhaps the method is only called when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType. But that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the method should handle both cases: when _referencedType is a ParameterizedType, it appends the type arguments within angle brackets; otherwise, it just appends the type.\n\nSo, the fixed code should:\n\n- Append the class name.\n- If _referencedType is a ParameterizedType:\n   - Append '<'\n   - For each type argument, recursively build their canonical names, appending commas.\n   - Append '>'.\n- Else:\n   - Append the referencedType's canonical name.\n\nSo, the fixed code would be:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type typeArg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalNameHelper(typeArg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n    } else {\n        sb.append(_referencedType.toCanonical());\n    }\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n\nprivate String buildCanonicalNameHelper(Type type) {\n    if (type instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) type;\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        sb.append(pt.getRawType().getName());\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type arg : pt.getActualTypeArguments()) {\n            sb.append(buildCanonicalNameHelper(arg));\n            sb.append(',');\n        }\n        if (pt.getActualTypeArguments().size() > 0) {\n            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);\n        }\n        sb.append('>');\n        return sb.toString();\n    } else if (type instanceof Class) {\n        return ((Class<?>) type).getName();\n    } else {\n        return type.toString();\n    }\n}\n\nBut this adds a helper method, which the original code didn't have. So perhaps the fixed function should be written without adding new methods, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed code can be written as:\n\nprotected String buildCanonicalName() {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(_class.getName());\n    if (_referencedType instanceof ParameterizedType) {\n        ParameterizedType pt = (ParameterizedType) _referencedType;\n        sb.append('<');\n        for (Type"
