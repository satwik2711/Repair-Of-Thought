Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function compareNodePointers is not correctly handling the case when the two NodePointers are at the same depth but do not have the same parent. This is because the function is only checking if the NodePointers are equal or if one is the parent of the other, but it is not checking if they have the same parent. This is causing the function to throw a JXPathException when it encounters two NodePointers that do not belong to the same tree.\nSuggestion: Check for Same Parent\nWe can add a check to see if the two NodePointers have the same parent before comparing them. If they do not have the same parent, we can throw a JXPathException. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (p1.parent != p2.parent) {\n    throw new JXPathException(\"Cannot compare pointers that do not belong to the same tree: '\" + p1 + \"' and '\" + p2 + \"'\");\n}\n```\nThis check should be added before the existing checks for equality and parent-child relationship.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate int compareNodePointers(\n    NodePointer p1,\n    int depth1,\n    NodePointer p2,\n    int depth2) \n{\n    if (depth1 < depth2) {\n        int r = compareNodePointers(p1, depth1, p2.parent, depth2 - 1);\n        return r == 0 ? -1 : r;\n    }\n    if (depth1 > depth2) {\n        int r = compareNodePointers(p1.parent, depth1 - 1, p2, depth2);\n        return r == 0 ? 1 : r;\n    }\n    if (p1 == null && p2 == null) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    if (p1 != null && p1.equals(p2)) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    if (depth1 == 1) {\n        throw new JXPathException(\n                \"Cannot compare pointers that do not belong to the same tree: '\"\n                        + p1 + \"' and '\" + p2 + \"'\");\n    }\n    int r = compareNodePointers(p1.parent, depth1 - 1, p2.parent, depth2 - 1);\n    if (r != 0) {\n        return r;\n    }\n\n    return p1.parent.compareChildNodePointers(p1, p2);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the function to throw a JXPathException when it encounters two NodePointers that do not belong to the same tree.\nSuggestion: Compare Ancestors\nWe can modify the function to compare the ancestors of the two NodePointers instead of just comparing the NodePointers themselves. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case when the two NodePointers are at the same depth but do not have the same parent. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nwhile (p1.parent != null && p2.parent != null) {\n    if (p1.parent.equals(p2.parent)) {\n        break;\n    }\n    p1 = p1.parent;\n    p2 = p2.parent;\n}\nif (p1.parent == null || p2.parent == null) {\n    throw new JXPathException(\"Cannot compare pointers that do not belong to the same tree: '\" + p1 + \"' and '\" + p2 + \"'\");\n}\n```\nThis code will traverse the ancestors of the two NodePointers until it finds a common ancestor or until it reaches the root of the tree.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate int compareNodePointers(\n    NodePointer p1,\n    int depth1,\n    NodePointer p2,\n    int depth2) \n{\n    if (depth1 < depth2) {\n        int r = compareNodePointers(p1, depth1, p2.parent, depth2 - 1);\n        return r == 0 ? -1 : r;\n    }\n    if (depth1 > depth2) {\n        int r = compareNodePointers(p1.parent, depth1 - 1, p2, depth2);\n        return r == 0 ? 1 : r;\n    }\n    if (p1 == null && p2 == null) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    if (p1 != null && p1.equals(p2)) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    if (depth1 == 1) {\n        throw new JXPathException(\n                \"Cannot compare pointers that do not belong to the same tree: '\"\n                        + p1 + \"' and '\" + p2 + \"'\");\n    }\n    int r = compareNodePointers(p1.parent, depth1 - 1, p2.parent, depth2 - 1);\n    if (r != 0) {\n        return r;\n    }\n\n    return p1.parent.compareChildNodePointers(p1, p2);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the function to throw a JXPathException when it encounters two NodePointers that do not belong to the same tree.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Comparison Method\nWe can modify the function to use a different comparison method that does not rely on the parent-child relationship between NodePointers. For example, we can use a method that compares the paths of the two NodePointers. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nString path1 = getPath(p1);\nString path2 = getPath(p2);\nif (!path1.equals(path2)) {\n    throw new JXPathException(\"Cannot compare pointers that do not belong to the same tree: '\" + p1 + \"' and '\" + p2 + \"'\");\n}\n```\nThis code assumes that the getPath function returns the path of a NodePointer from the root of the tree to the NodePointer.
