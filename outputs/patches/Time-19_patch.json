Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `getOffsetFromLocal` method is not correctly handling the case where the local time is in a DST overlap period. When the local time is in a DST overlap period, the method should return the earlier instant, but it is not doing so correctly. This is causing the method to return an incorrect offset, which is then used to calculate the UTC time.\nSuggestion: Adjusting the Offset Calculation\nWe can modify the `getOffsetFromLocal` method to adjust the offset calculation when the local time is in a DST overlap period. Specifically, we can add a check to see if the local time is in a DST overlap period, and if so, adjust the offset accordingly. This can be done by adding a new variable to track whether the local time is in a DST overlap period, and then using this variable to adjust the offset calculation.\n\n```java\npublic int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {\n    // ... (rest of the method remains the same)\n    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {\n        // ... (rest of the method remains the same)\n        if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {\n            // Add a check to see if the local time is in a DST overlap period\n            if (isInDSTOverlapPeriod(instantAdjusted)) {\n                // Adjust the offset accordingly\n                return offsetLocal;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return offsetAdjusted;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {\n    // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)\n    final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);\n    // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset\n    final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;\n    final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);\n    // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary\n    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {\n        // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap\n        // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative\n        if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {\n            // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed\n            // back before the transition, whereas it should be\n            // on or after the transition\n            long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);\n            long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);\n            if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {\n                return offsetLocal;\n            }\n        }\n    } else if (offsetLocal > 0) {\n        long prev = previousTransition(instantAdjusted);\n        if (prev < instantAdjusted) {\n            int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);\n            int diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal;\n            if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff) {\n                return offsetPrev;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return offsetAdjusted;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the method to return an incorrect offset, which is then used to calculate the UTC time.\nSuggestion: Using a Different Approach\nAnother approach to fixing this bug is to use a different method to calculate the offset. Instead of using the `getOffset` method to calculate the offset, we can use a different method that takes into account the DST overlap period. For example, we can use the `getOffset` method to calculate the offset for the previous transition, and then use this offset to calculate the offset for the current instant.\n\n```java\npublic int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {\n    // Calculate the offset for the previous transition\n    long prevTransition = previousTransition(instantLocal);\n    int prevOffset = getOffset(prevTransition);\n    \n    // Use the previous offset to calculate the offset for the current instant\n    int offset = prevOffset + (instantLocal - prevTransition);\n    return offset;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {\n    // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)\n    final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);\n    // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset\n    final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;\n    final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);\n    // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary\n    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {\n        // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap\n        // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative\n        if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {\n            // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed\n            // back before the transition, whereas it should be\n            // on or after the transition\n            long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);\n            long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);\n            if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {\n                return offsetLocal;\n            }\n        }\n    } else if (offsetLocal > 0) {\n        long prev = previousTransition(instantAdjusted);\n        if (prev < instantAdjusted) {\n            int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);\n            int diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal;\n            if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff) {\n                return offsetPrev;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return offsetAdjusted;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
