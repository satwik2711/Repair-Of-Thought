Specifically, it does not check for overflow when normalizing the variables, which can result in NaN (Not a Number) values being produced.

The issue is exacerbated by the fact that the `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge()` test case uses a very large boundary range, which triggers the overflow condition.\nSuggestion: Add Overflow Check\nAdd a check for overflow when normalizing the variables. This can be done by checking if the result of the subtraction `boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i]` is greater than `Double.MAX_VALUE`. If it is, throw a `NumberIsTooLargeException`.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the checkParameters() function. The problem is that when handling large boundary ranges, the function doesn't check for overflow, leading to NaN values and throwing the wrong exception. The suggestion is to use BigDecimal for higher precision.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original code. The function uses double arrays for boundaries. When it calculates the range, like boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i], if the values are very large, subtracting them might cause overflow, resulting in NaN.\n\nSo, I need to replace the double calculations with BigDecimal to avoid this. Let me plan the steps.\n\n1. Replace the boundaries array from double[][] to BigDecimal[][].\n2. When initializing boundaries, convert lB and uB from double[] to BigDecimal arrays.\n3. For each i, calculate the normalized value using BigDecimal subtraction.\n4. Check if this normalized value is positive. If not, throw an exception.\n5. Also, when checking inputSigma, compare against the BigDecimal normalized value instead of double.\n\nWait, but converting lB and uB to BigDecimal might require looping through each element. So I'll need helper methods or loops to do that.\n\nLet me think about the structure. After the initial checks, when boundaries are set, I'll create a BigDecimal version. Then, for each i, I'll compute the difference as a BigDecimal.\n\nIn the inputSigma check, instead of comparing doubles, I'll convert inputSigma[i] to BigDecimal and compare with the normalized value.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the case where boundaries are null? Because if there are no finite bounds, boundaries remain null. So I need to make sure that the code doesn't try to access boundaries when it's null.\n\nAlso, in the original code, after setting boundaries, there's a comment about aborting early if normalization overflows. That's where the problem occurs. So I need to add a check there.\n\nSo, in the else block where boundaries are not null, I'll compute the normalized values as BigDecimals. For each dimension, I'll subtract lower from upper. If any of these normalized values are not positive, I should throw an exception, maybe NumberIsTooLargeException.\n\nWait, the original code doesn't have that check. Oh, right, because the overflow causes NaN, which isn't handled. So adding this check with BigDecimal will prevent that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Change boundaries to BigDecimal[][].\n- Convert lB and uB to BigDecimal arrays.\n- For each i, compute normalizedValue = upper - lower.\n- If normalizedValue is less than or equal to zero, throw an exception.\n- In the inputSigma loop, compare each sigma as BigDecimal against normalizedValue.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the boundaries are set as boundaries[0] = lB and boundaries[1] = uB. So I need to convert these double arrays into BigDecimal.\n\nSo, I'll create two loops: one to convert lB to BigDecimal and another for uB.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a helper method to convert a double array to a BigDecimal array.\n\nLet me outline the code changes:\n\n1. After determining that boundaries are needed (hasFiniteBounds is true and no infinite bounds), create boundaries as a BigDecimal[][] array.\n\n2. Convert lB and uB to BigDecimal arrays. For each element in lB and uB, create a new BigDecimal.\n\n3. For each i, compute normalizedValue as boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]).\n\n4. Check if normalizedValue is positive. If not, throw an exception.\n\n5. In the inputSigma check, for each i, convert inputSigma[i] to BigDecimal and compare it against normalizedValue.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the inputSigma is a double array. So when comparing, I can create a BigDecimal from inputSigma[i] and compare it with the normalizedValue.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the comparison is:\n\nif (inputSigma[i] > boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i])\n\nWhich is a double comparison. Replacing it with BigDecimals would be more precise.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after computing normalizedValue as a BigDecimal, the condition becomes:\n\nif (new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]).compareTo(normalizedValue) > 0)\n\nThat way, we avoid double overflow.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn the else block where boundaries are not null:\n\n- Convert lB and uB to BigDecimal arrays.\n- Assign them to boundaries[0] and boundaries[1].\n- Then, for each i, compute normalizedValue.\n- Check if normalizedValue is <= 0, throw exception.\n- Also, compute whether the normalized value is too large, but wait, the original code doesn't have that. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that when the range is too large, the subtraction overflows, leading to NaN. So by using BigDecimal, we can detect if the subtraction results in a non-positive value, which would indicate an invalid range.\n\nWait, but the original code doesn't have this check. So adding this check will prevent the overflow from causing issues later.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after computing normalizedValue for each i, if it's <= 0, throw an exception, perhaps NumberIsTooLargeException or another appropriate one.\n\nWait, the original code's problem is that when the range is too large, the subtraction overflows to NaN, which then causes an incorrect exception. So by using BigDecimal, we can check if the subtraction is valid.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing normalizedValue, if it's less than or equal to zero, we throw an exception.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nIn the else block:\n\n- Convert lB and uB to BigDecimal arrays.\n- Assign to boundaries.\n- For each i, compute normalizedValue.\n- If any normalizedValue <= 0, throw exception.\n- Then, proceed to check inputSigma.\n\nIn the inputSigma loop:\n\n- For each i, create a BigDecimal from inputSigma[i].\n- Compare it against normalizedValue.\n- If it's larger, throw OutOfRangeException.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the OutOfRangeException is thrown when inputSigma[i] > (upper - lower). So with BigDecimals, the comparison is accurate.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, I'll need to convert the double arrays lB and uB into BigDecimal arrays.\n\nSo, I'll write loops:\n\nBigDecimal[] lowerBounds = new BigDecimal[lB.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < lB.length; i++) {\n    lowerBounds[i] = new BigDecimal(lB[i]);\n}\n\nSimilarly for upperBounds.\n\nThen, boundaries[0] = lowerBounds;\nboundaries[1] = upperBounds;\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nBigDecimal normalizedValue = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\nif (normalizedValue.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {\n    throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n}\n\nWait, but the original code doesn't have this check. So adding this will fix the overflow issue because if the subtraction overflows in double, it would result in NaN, but with BigDecimal, it's handled correctly.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the problem is that the subtraction can overflow, leading to NaN, which causes an exception. So with BigDecimal, we can compute the correct value and check if it's positive.\n\nSo, adding this check will ensure that we throw the correct exception when the range is invalid.\n\nNow, in the inputSigma loop:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < init.length; i++) {\n    if (inputSigma[i] < 0) {\n        throw new NotPositiveException(inputSigma[i]);\n    }\n    if (boundaries != null) {\n        BigDecimal sigma = new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]);\n        if (sigma.compareTo(normalizedValues[i]) > 0) {\n            throw new OutOfRangeException(inputSigma[i], 0, normalizedValues[i]);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but I need to store the normalizedValues for each i, perhaps in an array.\n\nSo, perhaps create a BigDecimal array normalizedValues = new BigDecimal[init.length];\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nnormalizedValues[i] = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\nif (normalizedValues[i].compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {\n    throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n}\n\nThen, in the inputSigma loop, compare against normalizedValues[i].\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's outline the code step by step.\n\n1. After determining that hasFiniteBounds is true and hasInfiniteBounds is false, proceed.\n\n2. Convert lB and uB to BigDecimal arrays.\n\n3. Assign to boundaries[0] and boundaries[1].\n\n4. Create normalizedValues array.\n\n5. For each i, compute normalizedValues[i] = upper - lower.\n\n6. Check if any normalizedValues[i] is <= 0. If so, throw NumberIsTooLargeException.\n\n7. Then, check inputSigma:\n\n   a. For each i, if inputSigma[i] is negative, throw NotPositiveException.\n\n   b. If boundaries are not null, convert inputSigma[i] to BigDecimal and compare with normalizedValues[i]. If larger, throw OutOfRangeException.\n\nNow, implement this in code.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the boundaries are set as double[][] and then later used. So, in the fixed code, boundaries should be BigDecimal[][].\n\nBut in the original code, after setting boundaries, there's a comment about aborting early if normalization overflows. So, that's where we need to add the check.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after converting to BigDecimal, compute normalizedValues and check each for positivity.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nIn the else block:\n\nboundaries = new BigDecimal[2][];\nboundaries[0] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(lB);\nboundaries[1] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(uB);\n\nBigDecimal[] normalizedValues = new BigDecimal[lB.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < lB.length; i++) {\n    normalizedValues[i] = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\n    if (normalizedValues[i].compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {\n        throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n    }\n}\n\nThen, in the inputSigma loop:\n\nif (boundaries != null) {\n    BigDecimal sigma = new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]);\n    if (sigma.compareTo(normalizedValues[i]) > 0) {\n        throw new OutOfRangeException(inputSigma[i], 0, normalizedValues[i].doubleValue());\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the OutOfRangeException expects double values for the lower and upper bounds. So, perhaps we can pass the double values of the bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to keep the original lower and upper as doubles for the exception message, but that might not be necessary. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the difference as a double, but that would defeat the purpose. So, perhaps in the exception, we can provide the actual numeric values as doubles, but that might lose precision. Alternatively, we can format the BigDecimal into a string.\n\nBut the original code uses (boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i]) as a double. So, perhaps in the fixed code, when throwing OutOfRangeException, we can compute the max as a double, but that might not be accurate for very large values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can take the BigDecimal values, but I don't think it's designed for that. So, perhaps it's better to compute the max as a double, but that would reintroduce the overflow issue.\n\nWait, but in the fixed code, the normalizedValues are BigDecimals, so when we throw the exception, perhaps we can pass the doubleValue() of normalizedValues[i], but that might not be accurate if the value is too large. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can be modified, but that's beyond the scope here. So, perhaps for the sake of this fix, we can proceed by using the doubleValue(), but that might not be perfect. Alternatively, perhaps we can pass the actual numeric values as strings, but that would require changing the exception, which isn't part of this fix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can take the max value as a BigDecimal, but that would require changing its constructor, which isn't possible here.\n\nSo, perhaps in this case, we'll proceed by using the doubleValue(), but that might not be accurate for very large values. However, given that the original code uses double, perhaps it's acceptable, as the primary issue is the overflow in the subtraction, which we've fixed by using BigDecimal.\n\nSo, in the exception, we can pass the doubleValue() of normalizedValues[i], but that might not be precise. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the difference as a BigDecimal and then pass it as a string in the exception message, but that would require changing how the exception is thrown.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to just pass 0 as the lower and upper, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, perhaps the OutOfRangeException is expecting the min and max as doubles, so perhaps we can compute the min and max from the original lB and uB arrays, which are doubles, and pass those. But that would be incorrect because for very large values, the subtraction could overflow.\n\nWait, but in the fixed code, we have the correct normalized value as a BigDecimal. So, perhaps the exception should be thrown with the correct max value, which is the normalizedValue. But since the exception expects doubles, perhaps we can let it throw with the correct value as a double, but that might not be possible for very large values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can be thrown with the correct max value as a BigDecimal, but that would require changing the exception class, which isn't part of this fix.\n\nSo, perhaps for the purpose of this fix, we can proceed by using the doubleValue() of the normalizedValue, but we have to be aware that for very large values, this might not be accurate. However, given that the original code uses double, and the primary issue is fixed by using BigDecimal for the comparison, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can take the max value as a Number, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nSo, perhaps in the fixed code, when throwing the OutOfRangeException, we can pass the doubleValue() of the normalizedValue. But that might not be accurate for very large values. Alternatively, perhaps we can pass the actual value as a String, but that would require changing the exception, which isn't possible here.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the doubleValue(), knowing that for very large values, the exception message might not be precise, but the primary issue of overflow is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can be avoided by ensuring that the inputSigma doesn't exceed the normalized value, which is correctly handled by the BigDecimal comparison.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (boundaries != null) {\n    BigDecimal sigma = new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]);\n    if (sigma.compareTo(normalizedValues[i]) > 0) {\n        throw new OutOfRangeException(inputSigma[i], 0, normalizedValues[i].doubleValue());\n    }\n}\n\nBut this might not be accurate for very large normalizedValues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the max as a double before the loop, but that would reintroduce the overflow issue.\n\nWait, but in the fixed code, the normalizedValues are computed as BigDecimals, so the subtraction is accurate. So, perhaps in the exception, we can pass the correct max value as a double, but that might not be possible for very large values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OutOfRangeException can be thrown with the correct max value by using the BigDecimal's toString().\n\nBut the OutOfRangeException's constructor expects double for the value, lower, and upper. So, perhaps we can't pass the exact value when it's too large.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a limitation, but the primary issue is that the function was throwing the wrong exception due to overflow. With the fix, it correctly throws when the sigma is too large, even for big values, so the exception is correctly thrown, even if the max value in the message is not precise. But that's a separate issue.\n\nSo, perhaps proceed with the code as described.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, the helper method to convert double[] to BigDecimal[]:\n\nprivate BigDecimal[] convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(double[] array) {\n    BigDecimal[] result = new BigDecimal[array.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n        result[i] = new BigDecimal(array[i]);\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nBut since this is a private method within the same class, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, in the else block:\n\nelse {\n    // Convert API to internal handling of boundaries.\n    boundaries = new BigDecimal[2][];\n    boundaries[0] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(lB);\n    boundaries[1] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(uB);\n\n    BigDecimal[] normalizedValues = new BigDecimal[lB.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < lB.length; i++) {\n        normalizedValues[i] = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\n        if (normalizedValues[i].compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {\n            throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Now, check inputSigma\n    if (inputSigma != null) {\n        if (inputSigma.length != init.length) {\n            throw new DimensionMismatchException(inputSigma.length, init.length);\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < init.length; i++) {\n            if (inputSigma[i] < 0) {\n                throw new NotPositiveException(inputSigma[i]);\n            }\n            if (boundaries != null) {\n                BigDecimal sigma = new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]);\n                if (sigma.compareTo(normalizedValues[i]) > 0) {\n                    throw new OutOfRangeException(inputSigma[i], 0, normalizedValues[i].doubleValue());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, the inputSigma check is outside the else block. So, in the fixed code, perhaps the inputSigma check should remain in the same place, but using the normalizedValues.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the original code structure.\n\nIn the original code, after setting boundaries, the code proceeds to check inputSigma regardless of whether boundaries are null or not.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the inputSigma check should be after the else block.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the original code.\n\nOriginal code structure:\n\nif (hasFiniteBounds) {\n    ... \n    else {\n        // Convert API to internal handling of boundaries.\n        boundaries = new double[2][];\n        boundaries[0] = lB;\n        boundaries[1] = uB;\n\n        // Abort early if the normalization will overflow (cf. \"encode\" method).\n    }\n} else {\n    // Convert API to internal handling of boundaries.\n    boundaries = null;\n}\n\nif (inputSigma != null) {\n    ... \n}\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the inputSigma check is after the if-else block.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after handling the boundaries, whether they are set or not, the inputSigma check proceeds.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the inputSigma check should be after the if-else.\n\nSo, in the else block (where boundaries are set), we compute the normalizedValues and store them in an array.\n\nThen, in the inputSigma check, for each i, compare against normalizedValues[i].\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nif (hasFiniteBounds) {\n    ...\n    else {\n        // Convert to BigDecimal\n        boundaries = new BigDecimal[2][];\n        boundaries[0] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(lB);\n        boundaries[1] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(uB);\n\n        // Compute normalizedValues\n        normalizedValues = new BigDecimal[init.length];\n        for (int i = 0; i < init.length; i++) {\n            normalizedValues[i] = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\n            if (normalizedValues[i].compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {\n                throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    boundaries = null;\n    normalizedValues = null;\n}\n\nif (inputSigma != null) {\n    if (inputSigma.length != init.length) {\n        throw new DimensionMismatchException(inputSigma.length, init.length);\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < init.length; i++) {\n        if (inputSigma[i] < 0) {\n            throw new NotPositiveException(inputSigma[i]);\n        }\n        if (boundaries != null) {\n            BigDecimal sigma = new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]);\n            if (sigma.compareTo(normalizedValues[i]) > 0) {\n                throw new OutOfRangeException(inputSigma[i], 0, normalizedValues[i].doubleValue());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the else block, when hasFiniteBounds is false, boundaries are null, and normalizedValues would also be null. So, in the inputSigma loop, when boundaries are null, we don't perform the check.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nBut wait, in the else block, when hasFiniteBounds is false, we set boundaries to null, and normalizedValues to null as well.\n\nSo, in the inputSigma loop, when boundaries is null, we skip the check.\n\nSo, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that normalizedValues is declared outside the else block so that it's accessible in the inputSigma loop.\n\nSo, perhaps declare normalizedValues before the if-else block.\n\nSo, adding:\n\nBigDecimal[] normalizedValues = null;\n\nThen, in the else block, compute it.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, the fixed function would look like this:\n\nprivate void checkParameters() {\n    final double[] init = getStartPoint();\n    final double[] lB = getLowerBound();\n    final double[] uB = getUpperBound();\n\n    // Checks whether there is at least one finite bound value.\n    boolean hasFiniteBounds = false;\n    for (int i = 0; i < lB.length; i++) {\n        if (!Double.isInfinite(lB[i]) ||\n            !Double.isInfinite(uB[i])) {\n            hasFiniteBounds = true;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    // Checks whether there is at least one infinite bound value.\n    boolean hasInfiniteBounds = false;\n    if (hasFiniteBounds) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < lB.length; i++) {\n            if (Double.isInfinite(lB[i]) ||\n                Double.isInfinite(uB[i])) {\n                hasInfiniteBounds = true;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (hasInfiniteBounds) {\n            // If there is at least one finite bound, none can be infinite,\n            // because mixed cases are not supported by the current code.\n            throw new MathUnsupportedOperationException();\n        } else {\n            // Convert API to internal handling of boundaries.\n            boundaries = new BigDecimal[2][];\n            boundaries[0] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(lB);\n            boundaries[1] = convertDoubleArrayToBigDecimal(uB);\n\n            // Compute normalized values\n            normalizedValues = new BigDecimal[init.length];\n            for (int i = 0; i < init.length; i++) {\n                normalizedValues[i] = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\n                if (normalizedValues[i].compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {\n                    throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Convert API to internal handling of boundaries.\n        boundaries = null;\n        normalizedValues = null;\n    }\n\n    if (inputSigma != null) {\n        if (inputSigma.length != init.length) {\n            throw new DimensionMismatchException(inputSigma.length, init.length);\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < init.length; i++) {\n            if (inputSigma[i] < 0) {\n                throw new NotPositiveException(inputSigma[i]);\n            }\n            if (boundaries != null) {\n                BigDecimal sigma = new BigDecimal(inputSigma[i]);\n                if (sigma.compareTo(normalizedValues"
