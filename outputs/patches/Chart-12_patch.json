Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the MultiplePiePlot constructor is not registering itself as a listener with the dataset. This is because the constructor is not calling the addChangeListener method on the dataset, which is necessary to register the plot as a listener.\nSuggestion: Register Plot as Listener\nRegister the plot as a listener with the dataset by calling the addChangeListener method on the dataset in the MultiplePiePlot constructor. This can be done by adding the following line of code to the constructor:\n```java\ndataset.addChangeListener(this);\n```\nThis line of code should be added after the line where the dataset is assigned to the this.dataset field.\n// Buggy Function\npublic MultiplePiePlot(CategoryDataset dataset) {\n    super();\n    this.dataset = dataset;\n    PiePlot piePlot = new PiePlot(null);\n    this.pieChart = new JFreeChart(piePlot);\n    this.pieChart.removeLegend();\n    this.dataExtractOrder = TableOrder.BY_COLUMN;\n    this.pieChart.setBackgroundPaint(null);\n    TextTitle seriesTitle = new TextTitle(\"Series Title\",\n            new Font(\"SansSerif\", Font.BOLD, 12));\n    seriesTitle.setPosition(RectangleEdge.BOTTOM);\n    this.pieChart.setTitle(seriesTitle);\n    this.aggregatedItemsKey = \"Other\";\n    this.aggregatedItemsPaint = Color.lightGray;\n    this.sectionPaints = new HashMap();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the constructor is not calling the addChangeListener method on the dataset, which is necessary to register the plot as a listener.\nSuggestion: Override DatasetChanged Method\nOverride the datasetChanged method in the MultiplePiePlot class to register the plot as a listener with the dataset when the dataset changes. This can be done by adding the following method to the MultiplePiePlot class:\n```java\n@Override\npublic void datasetChanged(DatasetChangeEvent event) {\n    if (event.getDataset() == dataset) {\n        dataset.addChangeListener(this);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method will be called whenever the dataset changes, and it will register the plot as a listener with the dataset.\n// Buggy Function\npublic MultiplePiePlot(CategoryDataset dataset) {\n    super();\n    this.dataset = dataset;\n    PiePlot piePlot = new PiePlot(null);\n    this.pieChart = new JFreeChart(piePlot);\n    this.pieChart.removeLegend();\n    this.dataExtractOrder = TableOrder.BY_COLUMN;\n    this.pieChart.setBackgroundPaint(null);\n    TextTitle seriesTitle = new TextTitle(\"Series Title\",\n            new Font(\"SansSerif\", Font.BOLD, 12));\n    seriesTitle.setPosition(RectangleEdge.BOTTOM);\n    this.pieChart.setTitle(seriesTitle);\n    this.aggregatedItemsKey = \"Other\";\n    this.aggregatedItemsPaint = Color.lightGray;\n    this.sectionPaints = new HashMap();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the constructor is not calling the addChangeListener method on the dataset, which is necessary to register the plot as a listener.\nSuggestion: Use Dataset's AddChangeListener Method in a Separate Method\nCreate a separate method in the MultiplePiePlot class to register the plot as a listener with the dataset, and call this method from the constructor. This can be done by adding the following method to the MultiplePiePlot class:\n```java\nprivate void registerListener() {\n    if (dataset != null) {\n        dataset.addChangeListener(this);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method can then be called from the constructor:\n```java\npublic MultiplePiePlot(CategoryDataset dataset) {\n    super();\n    this.dataset = dataset;\n    registerListener();\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis approach separates the registration of the listener from the rest of the constructor code, making it easier to read and maintain.\n// Buggy Function\npublic MultiplePiePlot(CategoryDataset dataset) {\n    super();\n    this.dataset = dataset;\n    PiePlot piePlot = new PiePlot(null);\n    this.pieChart = new JFreeChart(piePlot);\n    this.pieChart.removeLegend();\n    this.dataExtractOrder = TableOrder.BY_COLUMN;\n    this.pieChart.setBackgroundPaint(null);\n    TextTitle seriesTitle = new TextTitle(\"Series Title\",\n            new Font(\"SansSerif\", Font.BOLD, 12));\n    seriesTitle.setPosition(RectangleEdge.BOTTOM);\n    this.pieChart.setTitle(seriesTitle);\n    this.aggregatedItemsKey = \"Other\";\n    this.aggregatedItemsPaint = Color.lightGray;\n    this.sectionPaints = new HashMap();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
