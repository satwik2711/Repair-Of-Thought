      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` is not correctly checking if the Node is a FUNCTION or DO when it is preceded by a label. The function is only checking the type of the Node, but it is not considering the context in which the Node is being used. Specifically, it is not checking if the Node is enclosed in a block or if it is preceded by a label.\nSuggestion: Check for Label Precedence\nOne possible fix is to modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to check if the Node is preceded by a label. We can do this by checking if the Node's parent is a label, and if so, checking if the label is enclosed in a block. If the label is not enclosed in a block, we can return false, indicating that the Node is not a FUNCTION or DO.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n      // For labels with block children, we need to ensure that a\n      // labeled FUNCTION or DO isn't generated when extraneous BLOCKs \n      // are skipped. \n        // Either a empty statement or an block with more than one child,\n        // way it isn't a FUNCTION or DO.\n    return (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function is only checking the type of the Node, but it is not considering the context in which the Node is being used.

We can modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to check if the Node is preceded by a label, and if so, check if the label is enclosed in a block. We can also check if the Node is enclosed in a block, and if so, check if the block has only one child.
