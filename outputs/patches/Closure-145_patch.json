      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` is not correctly checking if a Node is a FUNCTION or DO when it is preceded by a label. The function is only checking the type of the Node, but it is not considering the presence of a label. This is causing the function to incorrectly identify Nodes that are preceded by a label as not being FUNCTIONS or DOs.\nSuggestion: Check for Labels\nWe can modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to check if the Node has a label. If it does, we can then check if the Node is a FUNCTION or DO. This can be done by adding a check for the presence of a label in the Node's children. Here is the modified function:\n```java\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n    if (n.hasLabel()) {\n        return n.getLabel().getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getLabel().getType() == Token.DO;\n    } else {\n        return n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO;\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n      // For labels with block children, we need to ensure that a\n      // labeled FUNCTION or DO isn't generated when extraneous BLOCKs \n      // are skipped. \n        // Either a empty statement or an block with more than one child,\n        // way it isn't a FUNCTION or DO.\n    return (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function is only checking the type of the Node, but it is not considering the presence of a label. This is causing the function to incorrectly identify Nodes that are preceded by a label as not being FUNCTIONS or DOs.\nSuggestion: Use a More Comprehensive Check\nWe can modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to use a more comprehensive check that takes into account the presence of labels. This can be done by checking if the Node is a FUNCTION or DO, and then checking if it has any children that are labels. Here is the modified function:\n```java\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n    if (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO) {\n        for (Node child : n.getChildren()) {\n            if (child.getType() == Token.LABEL) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n      // For labels with block children, we need to ensure that a\n      // labeled FUNCTION or DO isn't generated when extraneous BLOCKs \n      // are skipped. \n        // Either a empty statement or an block with more than one child,\n        // way it isn't a FUNCTION or DO.\n    return (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the function to incorrectly identify Nodes that are preceded by a label as not being FUNCTIONS or DOs.\nSuggestion: Modify the Node Type Check\nWe can modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to modify the Node type check to include cases where the Node is preceded by a label. This can be done by adding a check for the presence of a label in the Node's type. Here is the modified function:\n```java\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n    return (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO || n.getType() == Token.LABEL_FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.LABEL_DO);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo(Node n) {\n      // For labels with block children, we need to ensure that a\n      // labeled FUNCTION or DO isn't generated when extraneous BLOCKs \n      // are skipped. \n        // Either a empty statement or an block with more than one child,\n        // way it isn't a FUNCTION or DO.\n    return (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION || n.getType() == Token.DO);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
