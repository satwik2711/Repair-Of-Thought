Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `setSelected(Option option)` function is not being called when an option is parsed from the command line. The `selected` member variable is not being updated when an option is selected, resulting in `null` being returned when `getSelected()` is called.\nSuggestion: Update setSelected() to handle Option parsing\nThe `setSelected(Option option)` function should be updated to handle the parsing of options from the command line. This can be done by calling `setSelected(Option option)` when an option is parsed, and passing the parsed option to the function. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic void setSelected(Option option) throws AlreadySelectedException\n{\n    if (option == null)\n    {\n        // reset the option previously selected\n        selected = null;\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // if no option has already been selected or the \n    // same option is being reselected then set the\n    // selected member variable\n    if (selected == null || selected.equals(option))\n    {\n        selected = option;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        throw new AlreadySelectedException(this, option);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic void setSelected(Option option) throws AlreadySelectedException\n{\n    if (option == null)\n    {\n        // reset the option previously selected\n        selected = null;\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // if no option has already been selected or the \n    // same option is being reselected then set the\n    // selected member variable\n    if (selected == null || selected.equals(option.getOpt()))\n    {\n        selected = option.getOpt();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        throw new AlreadySelectedException(this, option);\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The `selected` member variable is not being updated when an option is selected, resulting in `null` being returned when `getSelected()` is called.\nSuggestion: Call setSelected() from Option parsing logic\nThe logic that parses options from the command line should be updated to call `setSelected(Option option)` when an option is parsed. This will ensure that the `selected` member variable is updated correctly. The corrected code would be:\n```java\n// In the option parsing logic\nif (option != null)\n{\n    group.setSelected(option);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic void setSelected(Option option) throws AlreadySelectedException\n{\n    if (option == null)\n    {\n        // reset the option previously selected\n        selected = null;\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // if no option has already been selected or the \n    // same option is being reselected then set the\n    // selected member variable\n    if (selected == null || selected.equals(option.getOpt()))\n    {\n        selected = option.getOpt();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        throw new AlreadySelectedException(this, option);\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The `selected` member variable is not being updated when an option is selected, resulting in `null` being returned when `getSelected()` is called.\nSuggestion: Update setSelected() to handle Option parsing with equals()\nInstead of comparing the `selected` member variable with the parsed option using `equals()`, we can update the `setSelected(Option option)` function to use the `equals()` method to compare the parsed option with the existing selected option. This will ensure that the correct option is selected even if the parsed option is not the same instance as the existing selected option.
