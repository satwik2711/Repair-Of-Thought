This is because the function is not correctly determining the dependency scope of the variable.\nSuggestion: Check for Variable Declaration\nWe can add a check to see if the variable is declared in the current scope, and if so, record the declaration. This can be done by checking if the parent node is a `VAR` node, and if so, recording the declaration. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {\n  ...\n  if (ns != null) {\n    if (parent.isVar()) {\n      recordVarDecl(recordNode, ns);\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {\n  Node nameNode = n.getFirstChild();\n  Node parent = n.getParent();\n  NameInformation ns = createNameInformation(t, nameNode);\n  if (ns != null) {\n    if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n      // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,\n      // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.

This is because the function is not correctly determining the dependency scope of the variable.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Dependency Scope\nWe can use a different dependency scope for the variable, such as the scope of the called function, instead of the scope of the assignment. This can be done by changing the `recordDepScope` call to use the scope of the called function. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {\n  ...\n  if (ns != null) {\n    if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n      if (parent.getFirstChild().getNext() != n) {\n        recordDepScope(recordNode, ns, parent.getFirstChild().getNext());\n      } else {\n        recordDepScope(nameNode, ns, parent.getFirstChild().getNext());\n      }\n    } else {\n      recordDepScope(recordNode, ns, parent.getFirstChild().getNext());\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {\n  Node nameNode = n.getFirstChild();\n  Node parent = n.getParent();\n  NameInformation ns = createNameInformation(t, nameNode);\n  if (ns != null) {\n    if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {\n      // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,\n      // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.
