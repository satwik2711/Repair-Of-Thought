      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the calculation of the mean in the `getNumericalMean` method. The current implementation returns `(double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize()`, which can result in a non-integer value. However, the `HypergeometricDistribution` class is expected to produce integer samples. The calculation of the mean is used in the sampling process, and an incorrect mean can lead to invalid samples. The issue arises when the product of `getSampleSize()` and `getNumberOfSuccesses()` is very large, causing an overflow when cast to a `double`. This can result in an incorrect mean value, leading to invalid samples.\nSuggestion: Avoid Overflow by Using BigDecimal\nUse the `BigDecimal` class to perform the calculation, which can handle large numbers without overflowing. The `getNumericalMean` method would be modified to use `BigDecimal` for the calculation. This approach would provide accurate results but may impact performance due to the overhead of using a more complex data type. The modified method would look like this:\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    BigDecimal sampleSize = BigDecimal.valueOf(getSampleSize());\n    BigDecimal numberOfSuccesses = BigDecimal.valueOf(getNumberOfSuccesses());\n    BigDecimal populationSize = BigDecimal.valueOf(getPopulationSize());\n    return sampleSize.multiply(numberOfSuccesses).divide(populationSize).doubleValue();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This can result in an incorrect mean value, leading to invalid samples.\nSuggestion: Use a More Precise Data Type\nInstead of using `double` for the calculation, consider using a more precise data type such as `long` to reduce the chance of overflow. However, this may still not be sufficient for very large numbers. To address this, the `getNumericalMean` method could be modified to use `long` for the calculation and then cast the result to `double`. This approach would provide more accurate results than using `double` but may still overflow for very large numbers.\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    long sampleSize = getSampleSize();\n    long numberOfSuccesses = getNumberOfSuccesses();\n    long populationSize = getPopulationSize();\n    return (double) (sampleSize * numberOfSuccesses) / (double) populationSize;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

If it would overflow, consider using a different approach, such as using a more precise data type or avoiding the calculation altogether if possible. This approach would add an extra step but could help prevent invalid results.\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    double sampleSize = getSampleSize();\n    double numberOfSuccesses = getNumberOfSuccesses();\n    double populationSize = getPopulationSize();\n    if (sampleSize * numberOfSuccesses > Double.MAX_VALUE) {\n        // Handle overflow, e.g., throw an exception or use a different approach\n    }\n    return (sampleSize * numberOfSuccesses) / populationSize;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

For example, instead of calculating the mean as `n * m / N`, consider calculating it as `n * (m / N)`. This approach would avoid the potential for overflow and provide more accurate results.\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    double sampleSize = getSampleSize();\n    double numberOfSuccesses = getNumberOfSuccesses();\n    double populationSize = getPopulationSize();\n    return sampleSize * (numberOfSuccesses / populationSize);\n}\n```\nEach of these suggestions has its trade-offs, and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the `HypergeometricDistribution` class.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function"
