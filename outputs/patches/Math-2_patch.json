      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the calculation of the mean in the `getNumericalMean` method and potentially in how the distribution's parameters are handled, leading to precision issues and incorrect sampling results. The large numbers involved in the calculation can cause integer overflow or precision loss, especially when performing integer division. This, in turn, affects the distribution's behavior, resulting in invalid samples.\nSuggestion: Improve Division Precision\nThe current method performs integer multiplication followed by division, which could lead to precision issues. Consider rearranging the calculation to minimize integer division: `return (double) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses() / getPopulationSize();` This ensures that at least one of the operands is a double before the division, potentially reducing precision loss. By casting one of the operands to a double, we ensure that the division operation is performed using floating-point arithmetic, which can handle the large numbers more accurately.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This, in turn, affects the distribution's behavior, resulting in invalid samples.\nSuggestion: Avoid Potential Overflow\nGiven the large numbers, there's a risk of overflow in the multiplication. Using `long` for the multiplication could help: `return (double) ((long) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / getPopulationSize();` This suggestion aims to prevent overflow by promoting the multiplication to `long` before the division. However, since the numbers are very large, even `long` might not be sufficient, and this approach might still lead to overflow.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

The mean of a hypergeometric distribution is indeed `n * m / N`, but ensure this formula is correctly applied in the context of the class and its methods. Perhaps the issue lies not in the precision but in how `getSampleSize()`, `getNumberOfSuccesses()`, or `getPopulationSize()` are defined or calculated, suggesting a review of these methods might be necessary. Ensure that these methods return the correct values and that the formula is applied consistently throughout the class.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This, in turn, affects the distribution's behavior, resulting in invalid samples.\nSuggestion: Use BigDecimal for High-Precision Arithmetic\nFor calculations involving very large numbers where precision is critical, consider using `BigDecimal` instead of primitive types. This would involve modifying the `getNumericalMean` method to use `BigDecimal` for the calculation: `return BigDecimal.valueOf(getSampleSize()).multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(getNumberOfSuccesses())).divide(BigDecimal.valueOf(getPopulationSize()), MathContext.DECIMAL128);` This approach provides high-precision arithmetic and can handle very large numbers without overflow or precision loss, making it suitable for calculations involving large population sizes and sample sizes. However, it may come at the cost of performance compared to using primitive types.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function"
