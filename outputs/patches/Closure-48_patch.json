Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The bug is caused by the fact that the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` does not correctly handle the case where a property is reassigned to a new function. In the trigger test, the method `fn` is reassigned to a new function, but the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` does not update the type information for the property `fn` accordingly. This leads to the incorrect assumption that the property `fn` is still a function that takes a boolean parameter, when in fact it has been reassigned to a new function that takes no parameters.\nSuggestion: Update Type Information on Reassignment\nOne possible solution is to update the type information for the property `fn` when it is reassigned to a new function. This can be done by adding a check in the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` to see if the property is being reassigned, and if so, update the type information accordingly. Specifically, we can add a new condition to the function that checks if the `rhsValue` is a function, and if so, updates the type information for the property `fn` to reflect the new function type.\n// Buggy Function\nvoid maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n  Node ownerNode = n.getFirstChild();\n  String ownerName = ownerNode.getQualifiedName();\n  String qName = n.getQualifiedName();\n  String propName = n.getLastChild().getString();\n  Preconditions.checkArgument(qName != null && ownerName != null);\n\n  // Precedence of type information on GETPROPs:\n  // 1) @type annnotation / @enum annotation\n  // 2) ASSIGN to FUNCTION literal\n  // 3) @param/@return annotation (with no function literal)\n  // 4) ASSIGN to something marked @const\n  // 5) ASSIGN to anything else\n  //\n  // 1, 3, and 4 are declarations, 5 is inferred, and 2 is a declaration iff\n  // the function has jsdoc or has not been declared before.\n  //\n  // FUNCTION literals are special because TypedScopeCreator is very smart\n  // about getting as much type information as possible for them.\n\n  // Determining type for #1 + #2 + #3 + #4\n  JSType valueType = getDeclaredType(t.getSourceName(), info, n, rhsValue);\n  if (valueType == null && rhsValue != null) {\n    // Determining type for #5\n    valueType = rhsValue.getJSType();\n  }\n  // Function prototypes are special.\n  // It's a common JS idiom to do:\n  // F.prototype = { ... };\n  // So if F does not have an explicitly declared super type,\n  // allow F.prototype to be redefined arbitrarily.\n  if (\"prototype\".equals(propName)) {\n    Var qVar = scope.getVar(qName);\n    if (qVar != null) {\n      // If the programmer has declared that F inherits from Super,\n      // and they assign F.prototype to an object literal,\n      // then they are responsible for making sure that the object literal's\n      // implicit prototype is set up appropriately.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the maybeDeclareQualifiedName function. The problem is that when a property is reassigned to a new function, the type information isn't updated correctly. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll review the root cause. The function doesn't handle reassignment of function properties properly. So when 'fn' is reassigned, the type info remains as the old function type instead of updating to the new one.\n\nLooking at the function, the key part is where it determines the valueType. It currently gets the declared type from getDeclaredType, and if that's null, it uses rhsValue's type. But in the case of reassignment, especially to a function, it's not updating the type info correctly.\n\nThe suggestion is to add a check when the rhsValue is a function. So, I should modify the code to update the type information for the property when this happens.\n\nLet me look at the code flow. The function starts by getting the valueType using getDeclaredType. If that's null and rhsValue is not null, it takes the type from rhsValue. But maybe this isn't sufficient when the property is being reassigned.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when the property is already declared, the code doesn't update its type. So, I need to check if the property exists in the scope and update its type if the rhsValue is a function.\n\nSo, in the code, after getting the valueType, I should check if rhsValue is a function. If it is, I should update the property's type in the scope.\n\nHow do I do that? Maybe after determining the valueType, I can check if rhsValue is a function. If yes, then I should get the function type and update the scope's variable for that property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the section where the code is determining whether the declaration is inferred, I can add logic to update the type if the rhsValue is a function.\n\nWait, looking at the code, after the 'if (valueType == null)' block, it proceeds to check if the declaration is inferred. Then, if not inferred, it defines the property.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, the property might already be declared, so the code might not be updating it.\n\nSo, perhaps I should add a condition: if rhsValue is a function, then regardless of previous declarations, update the type information for the property.\n\nLet me think about where to place this. Maybe after the 'valueType' is determined, I can add a check for rhsValue being a function. If so, then set the valueType accordingly.\n\nWait, the current code already sets valueType to rhsValue.getJSType() if getDeclaredType returns null. So, if rhsValue is a function, its type should be captured. But maybe in some cases, like when the property was previously declared, this isn't being handled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the property is reassigned, the function doesn't check if it's already declared and update it.\n\nSo, perhaps in the section where the code checks if the ownerType has the property, I can add logic to update the property's type if the rhsValue is a function.\n\nWait, looking at the code, in the 'if (!inferred)' block, it checks if the ownerType has the property. If not, or if it's inferred, it defines it. But if the property is already declared, it doesn't update it.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to modify this part to update the property's type when the rhsValue is a function, even if the property was previously declared.\n\nHmm, maybe the solution is to, after determining the valueType, if the rhsValue is a function, then check if the property exists in the scope. If it does, update its type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the section where the code defines the slot, it should force an update if the rhsValue is a function.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that when the property is reassigned to a function, the code doesn't mark it as a function type, leading to incorrect assumptions later.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, after the 'if (valueType == null)' block, I should add a condition: if rhsValue is a function, then set the valueType to the function type, overriding any previous value.\n\nWait, but the code already does that. Let me check:\n\nvalueType is set via getDeclaredType, which returns null if no declared type. Then, if rhsValue is not null, valueType is set to rhsValue.getJSType(). So, if rhsValue is a function, its type should be captured.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the getDeclaredType is returning a non-null value, preventing the code from using the rhsValue's type. For example, if the property was previously declared with a type, maybe getDeclaredType returns that instead of the new function type.\n\nWait, no, because getDeclaredType is called with the current 'n' and 'rhsValue'. So, perhaps in the case of reassignment, the getDeclaredType isn't returning null, so the code doesn't pick up the new function type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function isn't correctly handling cases where the property is being reassigned, not just assigned for the first time.\n\nSo, maybe the fix is to, when rhsValue is a function, force the valueType to be the function's type, regardless of previous declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the current assignment is to a function and update the type accordingly, even if the property was previously declared.\n\nSo, perhaps adding a condition after the initial valueType assignment:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    valueType = rhsValue.getJSType();\n}\n\nWait, but that might override cases where getDeclaredType returns a more specific type. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the property is reassigned to a function, the code doesn't treat it as a declaration, so it doesn't update the type info.\n\nLooking back at the code, the 'inferred' variable is set based on whether the current assignment is considered a declaration or not. If it's a declaration, then the type is set; otherwise, it's inferred.\n\nIn the case of reassignment, the code might not be treating it as a declaration, so the type isn't updated.\n\nSo, perhaps in the 'inferred' determination, I should add a condition that if rhsValue is a function, then it's considered a declaration, thus updating the type.\n\nWait, the 'inferred' variable is set to false if certain conditions are met, indicating it's a declaration. So, perhaps adding a condition that if rhsValue is a function, then it's a declaration.\n\nLooking at the code, the 'inferred' is initially set based on info. Then, it's updated again if rhsValue is a function and certain conditions are met.\n\nWait, in the code:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null &&\n        rhsValue.isFunction() &&\n        (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSo, if rhsValue is a function, and either info is not null or the qName isn't declared in the scope, then it's not inferred.\n\nBut perhaps in the case of reassignment, the qName is already declared, so the second part is false, making 'inferred' true. Which would mean the code doesn't treat it as a declaration, so the type isn't updated.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to consider that reassignment to a function should be treated as a declaration, updating the type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be modified to treat any function assignment as a declaration, regardless of whether it's already declared.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct in all cases. For example, if the function is assigned in a way that's not a declaration, like inside a function body, it might not be intended as a type declaration.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nAnother approach: when the rhsValue is a function, regardless of other conditions, we should update the type information for the property. So, in the code, after determining the valueType, if rhsValue is a function, we should set the valueType to the function's type.\n\nWait, but that might override cases where the function has JSDoc that specifies a different type. So, perhaps we should only do this if the valueType is null, meaning no declared type is found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always take the function's type when rhsValue is a function, unless there's an explicit declared type.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the 'valueType' is first set via getDeclaredType, which looks for explicit type annotations. If that's null, then it uses rhsValue's type. So, if rhsValue is a function, its type should be used.\n\nBut perhaps in the case of reassignment, the getDeclaredType is returning a non-null value, preventing the code from using the new function's type.\n\nWait, how does getDeclaredType work? It probably looks for type annotations in the current assignment. So, if the assignment is just 'fn = function(){};' without any type annotation, getDeclaredType would return null, and then rhsValue's type would be used.\n\nBut in the test case, the function is being reassigned, so the code should pick up the new function's type.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when the property is already declared, the code doesn't update its type. So, perhaps in the section where the code defines the slot, it should check if the property is already declared and update it.\n\nLooking at the code, in the 'if (!inferred)' block, it checks if the ownerType has the property. If not, or if it's inferred, it defines it. But if the property is already declared, it doesn't do anything.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to modify this part to update the property's type even if it's already declared, but only when the rhsValue is a function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always update the property's type when the rhsValue is a function, regardless of whether it's already declared.\n\nSo, perhaps adding a condition after the 'if (!inferred)' block:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    // Update the property's type to the new function type\n    ownerType.defineDeclaredProperty(propName, valueType, n);\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code isn't considering the reassignment as a declaration. So, in the 'inferred' variable calculation, it's treating the reassignment as inferred, thus not updating the type.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition for 'inferred' should be adjusted to treat function reassignments as declarations.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null &&\n        rhsValue.isFunction() &&\n        (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSo, if rhsValue is a function, and either info is not null or qName isn't declared, then it's not inferred.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, qName is already declared, so the second part is false, making 'inferred' true. Thus, the code doesn't treat it as a declaration, so the type isn't updated.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to treat function reassignments as declarations even if qName is already declared.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. For example, if someone does:\n\nvar x = function(a) {};\nx = function(b) {};\n\nThe second assignment is not a declaration, so the type shouldn't be updated as a declaration.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the code should always update the property's type when the rhsValue is a function, regardless of whether it's a declaration or not. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the current assignment is to a function, and if the property's type is already declared, update it.\n\nWait, perhaps in the 'if (!inferred)' block, after defining the slot, I can add a check for rhsValue being a function and update the ownerType's property accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not just define the property if it's not declared, but also update it if it's already declared but the type has changed.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement that without causing other issues.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the code doesn't handle the case where a property is assigned a function after being previously assigned a different type. So, the type information isn't updated, leading to incorrect assumptions.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to, whenever the rhsValue is a function, update the property's type in the scope, regardless of whether it's a declaration or not.\n\nBut how to do that in the code.\n\nLooking back, after the 'if (!inferred)' block, the code defines the slot. Maybe in that block, I can add logic to update the ownerType's property.\n\nWait, in the 'if (!inferred)' block, the code does:\n\nif ((!ownerType.hasOwnProperty(propName) || ownerType.isPropertyTypeInferred(propName)) && ... ) {\n    ownerType.defineDeclaredProperty(propName, valueType, n);\n}\n\nSo, perhaps I can modify this condition to also include cases where the rhsValue is a function, even if the property is already declared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can add an else if condition that checks if rhsValue is a function and updates the property type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always define the property if rhsValue is a function, regardless of whether it's inferred or not.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that when the property is reassigned to a function, the code doesn't consider it a declaration, so it doesn't update the type. So, perhaps in the 'inferred' calculation, I should treat function reassignments as declarations.\n\nSo, perhaps modifying the 'inferred' condition to set inferred to false when rhsValue is a function, regardless of other factors.\n\nBut that might not be correct in all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should treat any assignment of a function to a property as a declaration, thus updating the type information.\n\nSo, perhaps in the 'inferred' variable calculation, I can add a condition that if rhsValue is a function, then inferred is set to false.\n\nWait, but the current code already does that in part. Let me look:\n\ninferred is initially set based on info. Then, it's updated with:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSo, if rhsValue is a function and (info is not null or qName is not declared), then inferred is false.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, qName is already declared, so the second part is false, making the condition false, so inferred remains as it was.\n\nSo, perhaps in the case of reassignment, the code doesn't treat it as a declaration, thus not updating the type.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to treat function assignments as declarations even if qName is already declared.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction());\n\nBut that would treat all function assignments as declarations, which might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nWait, no, that would make it so that if the qName is declared, it's not considered a declaration, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the code isn't considering reassignment as a declaration when it should. So, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to treat function reassignments as declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always update the type information when the rhsValue is a function, regardless of whether it's a declaration or not.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when the property is reassigned to a function, the code doesn't update the type because the 'inferred' variable is true, so it doesn't enter the 'if (!inferred)' block where the type is defined.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to make sure that when rhsValue is a function, 'inferred' is set to false, forcing the code to update the type.\n\nSo, perhaps modifying the 'inferred' calculation to set it to false when rhsValue is a function, regardless of other conditions.\n\nBut that might have unintended consequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should set 'inferred' to false if rhsValue is a function, even if other conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps adding an additional condition after the initial 'inferred' calculation:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis way, any assignment of a function to a property is treated as a declaration, updating the type.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct in all cases. For example, if the function is assigned as part of an expression, not a declaration, should the type be updated?\n\nIn JavaScript, assigning a function to a property is a declaration in the sense that it sets the type of that property. So, perhaps it's correct to treat it as a declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps adding this condition would fix the issue.\n\nSo, in the code, after the initial 'inferred' calculation, I can add:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis would ensure that whenever a function is assigned, it's treated as a declaration, updating the type information.\n\nLet me see where to place this. After the 'inferred' is initially set, perhaps after the line:\n\ninferred = !(info != null || ... );\n\nWait, no, the initial 'inferred' is set in two steps. First, based on info, then based on rhsValue being a function.\n\nSo, perhaps after the second assignment to 'inferred', I can add the new condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to adjust the condition where 'inferred' is set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always treat function assignments as declarations, so setting 'inferred' to false whenever rhsValue is a function.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter the line:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null &&\n        rhsValue.isFunction() &&\n        (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nAdd:\n\n// Treat reassignment of functions as declarations\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis way, any function assignment, whether initial or reassignment, is treated as a declaration, updating the type info.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. It might cause other issues where function assignments are not intended to be type declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should only treat function assignments as declarations if they are the initial assignment or if the type has changed.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the case of reassignment, the code doesn't update the type because the 'inferred' variable is true, so it doesn't enter the block where the type is defined.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to force 'inferred' to be false when rhsValue is a function, ensuring that the type is updated.\n\nSo, adding the condition:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nafter the initial 'inferred' calculation.\n\nLet me think about how this would affect the code.\n\nIn the test case, when 'fn' is reassigned to a new function, rhsValue is a function. So, 'inferred' would be set to false, causing the code to enter the 'if (!inferred)' block, where it defines the property with the new type.\n\nThis should fix the issue.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. After calculating 'inferred' based on the existing conditions, check if rhsValue is a function.\n2. If it is, set 'inferred' to false.\n3. This ensures that the code treats the assignment as a declaration, updating the type info.\n\nNow, I'll implement this in the code.\n\nLooking at the code, after the line:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null &&\n        rhsValue.isFunction() &&\n        (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nI'll add:\n\n// Update: Treat function reassignment as declaration\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis should ensure that any function assignment updates the type information.\n\nI think this should fix the bug where reassigning a function doesn't update the type info.\n\nSo, the final code will include this additional condition to set 'inferred' to false when rhsValue is a function.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where reassigning a function to a property doesn't update the type information, we modify the `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` function to treat function reassignments as declarations. This ensures the type information is updated correctly.\n\n```java\nvoid maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n  Node ownerNode = n.getFirstChild();\n  String ownerName = ownerNode.getQualifiedName();\n  String qName = n.getQualifiedName();\n  String propName = n.getLastChild().getString();\n  Preconditions.checkArgument(qName != null && ownerName != null);\n\n  // Precedence of type information on GETPROPs:\n  // 1) @type annotation / @enum annotation\n  // 2) ASSIGN to FUNCTION literal\n  // 3) @param/@return annotation (with no function literal)\n  // 4) ASSIGN to something marked @const\n  // 5) ASSIGN to anything else\n  //\n  // 1, 3, and 4 are declarations, 5 is inferred, and 2 is a declaration iff\n  // the function has jsdoc or has not been declared before.\n  //\n  // FUNCTION literals are special because TypedScopeCreator is very smart\n  // about getting as much type information as possible for them.\n\n  // Determining type for #1 + #2 + #3 + #4\n  JSType valueType = getDeclaredType(t.getSourceName(), info, n, rhsValue);\n  if (valueType == null && rhsValue != null) {\n    // Determining type for #5\n    valueType = rhsValue.getJSType();\n  }\n  // Function prototypes are special.\n  // It's a common JS idiom to do:\n  // F.prototype = { ... };\n  // So if F does not have an explicitly declared super type,\n  // allow F.prototype to be redefined arbitrarily.\n  if (\"prototype\".equals(propName)) {\n    Var qVar = scope.getVar(qName);\n    if (qVar != null) {\n      // If the programmer has declared that F inherits from Super,\n      // and they assign F.prototype to an object literal,\n      // then they are responsible for making sure that the object literal's\n      // implicit prototype is set up appropriately.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the maybeDeclareQualifiedName function. The problem is that when a property is reassigned to a new function, the function doesn't update the type information correctly. So, the type of the property remains as the old function type instead of the new one.\n\nLooking at the root cause, the issue arises because the function doesn't handle reassignments properly. The current code checks if the property is declared or inferred but doesn't account for cases where the property is reassigned to a new function.\n\nThe suggestion is to use a more robust type inference algorithm. So, I need to adjust how the function determines the type when a property is reassigned.\n\nIn the original code, the function first tries to get the declared type using getDeclaredType. If that's null and rhsValue isn't null, it uses rhsValue's type. But this might not handle reassignments correctly because it might not update the type information when the function is reassigned.\n\nI think the key is to ensure that when a property is reassigned, especially to a new function, the type is updated. So, I should modify the logic to check if the property has been previously declared and, if so, update its type accordingly.\n\nLet me look at the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the function gets the valueType by checking getDeclaredType, then falls back to rhsValue's type if needed. Then, it handles the prototype case, which I don't think is directly related here.\n\nAfter that, if valueType is null, it adds a stub declaration. Otherwise, it proceeds to determine if the property is declared or inferred.\n\nThe problem seems to be in how 'inferred' is determined. The current code marks it as inferred unless certain conditions are met. But when a function is reassigned, the type should be updated, so perhaps the inference needs to be more dynamic.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that when the property is reassigned, the function doesn't check if it's already been declared. So, in the case where the property was previously declared, the new assignment should override the old type.\n\nLooking at the code, after determining valueType, it checks if it's null. If not, it proceeds to determine if it's inferred or declared.\n\nIn the case of reassignment, the function might have already been declared, so the code should update the existing declaration with the new type.\n\nSo, perhaps in the section where it defines the slot, it should check if the property is already declared and update it accordingly.\n\nWait, in the code, after determining 'inferred', if it's not inferred, it proceeds to define the slot. But maybe in the case of reassignment, the function should always update the type, regardless of whether it's inferred or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'inferred' flag is being set incorrectly when the property is reassigned. Let me see how 'inferred' is calculated.\n\nThe 'inferred' variable is set to true initially. Then, if info is not null, it checks for certain conditions to set 'inferred' to false. Then, if inferred is still true, it checks if rhsValue is a function and whether the property was previously declared.\n\nIn the case of reassignment, rhsValue is a function, and if the property was previously declared, then 'inferred' becomes false. So, the code should treat it as a declaration and update the type.\n\nWait, but in the trigger test, the function is reassigned. So, in that case, the code should recognize that the property is being reassigned and update its type.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that the code isn't correctly determining that the property is being reassigned and thus not updating the type.\n\nLooking at the code, when 'inferred' is false, it defines the slot. So, in the case of reassignment, 'inferred' should be false, and the code should update the slot.\n\nBut maybe the condition for setting 'inferred' to false isn't catching the reassignment case correctly.\n\nLet me check the condition:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSo, if rhsValue is a function, and either info is not null or the property hasn't been declared before, then it's not inferred.\n\nIn the reassignment case, the property has been declared before, so !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) would be false. So, if info is null, then the condition becomes !(true && false), which is true. So, 'inferred' remains true.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in the reassignment case, the property was already declared, so scope.isDeclared(qName, false) would return true. So, the condition becomes:\n\nrhsValue is function, info is null, and !scope.isDeclared(...) is false. So, the entire condition is (true && (false || false)) \u2192 false. So, 'inferred' remains true.\n\nBut in that case, the code would treat it as inferred, which might not update the type correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition for 'inferred' is incorrect. It should mark it as not inferred if the property is being reassigned to a function, even if info is null.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'inferred' logic needs to be adjusted to account for reassignments.\n\nAnother approach is to always update the type when the property is reassigned, regardless of whether it's inferred or declared.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, after determining the valueType, if the property is already declared, we should update its type instead of leaving it as is.\n\nLooking at the code, in the 'if (!inferred)' block, it checks if the ownerType has the property, and if it's not declared or is inferred, then it defines it. But in the case of reassignment, the property is already declared, so it might not update.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should not just define the property if it's not declared, but also update it if it's already declared.\n\nWait, in the 'defineSlot' function, does it handle updating existing properties? Or does it only declare new ones?\n\nI think in the current code, if the property is already declared, it might not update the type. So, in the reassignment case, the type isn't updated, leading to the bug.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps in the 'if (!inferred)' block, we should check if the property is already declared and update its type accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should always define the slot with the new type, overriding any previous declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to allow updating the type even if the property was previously declared.\n\nLooking at the code, in the 'if (!inferred)' block:\n\nif ((!ownerType.hasOwnProperty(propName) || ownerType.isPropertyTypeInferred(propName)) && ... ) {\n    ownerType.defineDeclaredProperty(...);\n}\n\nSo, it only defines the property if it's not already declared or if the type is inferred. But in the case of reassignment, the property is already declared, so this condition is false, and the type isn't updated.\n\nTherefore, the code doesn't update the type when the property is reassigned, leading to the bug.\n\nSo, the fix would be to modify this condition to allow updating the type even if the property is already declared, but perhaps only when the new type is more specific or when it's a reassignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be removed, and the code should always attempt to define the property, allowing the defineDeclaredProperty method to handle updates.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the implications of that. Maybe defineDeclaredProperty already handles updating, but the condition is preventing it from being called.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to include cases where the property is being reassigned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not have that condition and always attempt to define the property.\n\nWait, looking at the comment in the code:\n\n// Only declare this as an official property if it has not been declared yet.\n\nSo, the code is intentionally avoiding redefining already declared properties. But in the case of reassignment, we need to update the type.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to allow redefining if the property is being reassigned.\n\nBut how can we detect that in the code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always define the property type, overriding any previous declaration when a new assignment occurs.\n\nSo, in the 'if (!inferred)' block, perhaps we should remove the condition and always call defineDeclaredProperty.\n\nBut that might have other implications, such as overriding user annotations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be modified to check if the property is being reassigned, perhaps by checking if rhsValue is a function and the property was previously a function with different parameters.\n\nBut that might be too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always update the property's type when it's reassigned, regardless of whether it was previously declared.\n\nSo, in the 'if (!inferred)' block, remove the condition and always call defineDeclaredProperty.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think about the possible side effects.\n\nIf we remove the condition, then every time a property is assigned, it will update its type. That might be correct because each assignment could potentially change the type.\n\nBut in the original code, the condition was there to avoid overriding explicit declarations. So, perhaps the fix is to adjust the condition to allow updating when the property is being reassigned.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the case of reassignment, the code doesn't recognize that the property is being updated, so it doesn't update the type.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to modify the condition to allow updating the type even if the property was previously declared, but only when the new assignment is to a function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'inferred' flag is not being set correctly in the case of reassignment, leading the code to not update the type.\n\nWait, in the reassignment case, rhsValue is a function, and the property was previously declared. So, in the 'inferred' calculation:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSince rhsValue is a function, info is null (assuming no jsdoc), and scope.isDeclared(qName, false) is true (because it was declared before), the condition becomes:\n\n!(true && (false || false)) \u2192 true.\n\nSo, 'inferred' is true, which means the code will not enter the 'if (!inferred)' block, and thus not update the type.\n\nThat's the problem. Because in the reassignment case, 'inferred' is true, so the code doesn't update the type.\n\nSo, the fix is to adjust the 'inferred' calculation so that in the case of reassignment to a function, it's treated as not inferred, thus entering the block to update the type.\n\nHow can we adjust the condition?\n\nPerhaps, when the property is being reassigned (i.e., the parent is an assignment), we should treat it as not inferred.\n\nWait, the parent is the assignment node. So, in the case of reassignment, parent is an assignment.\n\nIn the code, the 'parent' variable is passed as an argument. So, perhaps in the condition, we can check if the parent is an assignment, indicating that the property is being reassigned.\n\nSo, modifying the 'inferred' calculation:\n\nif (parent.isAssignment()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to set 'inferred' to false when the property is being reassigned to a function, regardless of previous declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) || parent.isAssignment()));\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'inferred' flag should be set to false whenever the property is being reassigned, indicating that the type should be updated.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'inferred' variable is meant to determine whether the type is being declared or inferred. So, in the case of reassignment, it's a declaration, so 'inferred' should be false.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to set 'inferred' to false when the property is being reassigned to a function, even if it was previously declared.\n\nSo, modifying the condition:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nTo also consider whether the parent is an assignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || (parent.isAssignment() || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false))));\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the condition should be split into two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the property is being reassigned, the code treats it as inferred, thus not updating the type. So, to fix this, we need to ensure that in the case of reassignment, 'inferred' is set to false.\n\nSo, perhaps after the initial 'inferred' calculation, we can add a condition that if the parent is an assignment and rhsValue is a function, then set 'inferred' to false.\n\nSo, adding:\n\nif (parent.isAssignment() && rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis way, when the property is being reassigned to a function, it's treated as a declaration, and the type is updated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial condition can be modified to include parent.isAssignment().\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact logic here. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original code, the 'inferred' variable is set based on whether the current assignment is considered a declaration or an inference. For function assignments, it's considered a declaration if the function has JSDoc or hasn't been declared before.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, the function has been declared before, so the code treats it as inferred, which is incorrect because the type should be updated.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should treat reassignments as declarations, thus setting 'inferred' to false.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) || parent.isAssignment()));\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think about the logic.\n\nThe condition is: if rhsValue is a function, and (info is not null OR the property hasn't been declared before OR it's an assignment), then it's not inferred.\n\nWait, no. The original condition is:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSo, it's not inferred (i.e., it's a declaration) if rhsValue is a function and either info is not null or the property hasn't been declared before.\n\nIn the reassignment case, the property has been declared before, so !scope.isDeclared is false. If info is null, then the condition becomes (true && (false || false)) \u2192 false, so 'inferred' remains true.\n\nSo, to include reassignment as a declaration, perhaps we need to add another condition.\n\nMaybe the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) || parent.isAssignment()));\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to set 'inferred' to false when the parent is an assignment, indicating that it's a reassignment.\n\nSo, perhaps after the initial 'inferred' calculation, we can add:\n\nif (parent.isAssignment() && rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis would ensure that in reassignment cases, the type is treated as declared, and thus the code updates the property's type.\n\nSo, in the code, after the initial 'inferred' calculation, add this condition.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. After calculating 'inferred' as before, check if the parent is an assignment and rhsValue is a function.\n2. If so, set 'inferred' to false.\n3. This ensures that in reassignment cases, the code proceeds to update the type.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\n// ... previous code ...\n\nboolean inferred = true;\nif (info != null) {\n    inferred = !(info.hasType() || info.hasEnumParameterType() || (info.isConstant() && valueType != null && !valueType.isUnknownType()) || FunctionTypeBuilder.isFunctionTypeDeclaration(info));\n}\n\nif (inferred) {\n    inferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n}\n\n// Add the new condition\nif (parent.isAssignment() && rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\n// ... rest of the code ...\n\nThis way, when the property is being reassigned to a function, 'inferred' is set to false, and the code will update the type.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition can be incorporated into the existing 'inferred' calculation.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the property is being reassigned and, if so, treat it as a declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the 'inferred' variable should be set to false if the parent is an assignment and rhsValue is a function, regardless of other conditions.\n\nI think adding the extra condition after the initial 'inferred' calculation is a safe approach.\n\nTesting this change, in the trigger test case, when 'fn' is reassigned to a new function, the parent is an assignment, so 'inferred' becomes false. Then, the code proceeds to define the slot with the new type, updating the property's type correctly.\n\nSo, the fix is to add this condition to set 'inferred' to false when the parent is an assignment and rhsValue is a function.\n\nNow, I'll update the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` does not update the type information when a property is reassigned to a new function, we need to adjust how the function determines whether the type is inferred or declared. Specifically, we must ensure that reassignments are treated as declarations, prompting the function to update the type information accordingly.\n\nHere is the corrected implementation:\n\n```java\nvoid maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n  Node ownerNode = n.getFirstChild();\n  String ownerName = ownerNode.getQualifiedName();\n  String qName = n.getQualifiedName();\n  String propName = n.getLastChild().getString();\n  Preconditions.checkArgument(qName != null && ownerName != null);\n\n  // Precedence of type information on GETPROPs:\n  // 1) @type annotation / @enum annotation\n  // 2) ASSIGN to FUNCTION literal\n  // 3) @param/@return annotation (with no function literal)\n  // 4) ASSIGN to something marked @const\n  // 5) ASSIGN to anything else\n  //\n  // 1, 3, and 4 are declarations, 5 is inferred, and 2 is a declaration iff\n  // the function has jsdoc or has not been declared before.\n  //\n  // FUNCTION literals are special because TypedScopeCreator is very smart\n  // about getting as much type information as possible for them.\n\n  // Determining type for #1 + #2 + #3 + #4\n  JSType valueType = getDeclaredType(t.getSourceName(), info, n, rhsValue);\n  if (valueType == null && rhsValue != null) {\n    // Determining type for #5\n    valueType = rhsValue.getJSType();\n  }\n  // Function prototypes are special.\n  // It's a common JS idiom to do:\n  // F.prototype = { ... };\n  // So if F does not have an explicitly declared super type,\n  // allow F.prototype to be redefined arbitrarily.\n  if (\"prototype\".equals(propName)) {\n    Var qVar = scope.getVar(qName);\n    if (qVar != null) {\n      // If the programmer has declared that F inherits from Super,\n      // and they assign F.prototype to an object literal,\n      // then they are responsible for making sure that the object literal's\n      // implicit prototype is set up appropriately.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName`. The problem is that when a property is reassigned to a new function, the function doesn't update the type information correctly. So, the function still thinks the property is the old function type, which causes issues.\n\nLooking at the root cause, the issue arises when `fn` is reassigned. The current code doesn't handle this reassignment properly. The suggestion is to add a special case for when the property is being set to a new function.\n\nLet me look at the original function. It starts by getting the owner node and the property name. Then it determines the value type based on various conditions. It checks if the property is 'prototype' and handles that specially. Then, if the value type is null, it adds a stub declaration or returns.\n\nThe main part where the problem occurs is when the function is reassigned. The code currently doesn't check if the rhsValue is a function in a way that would trigger a redeclaration.\n\nI think the fix involves adding a condition where, if the rhsValue is a function, we treat it as a new declaration. So, in the section where `inferred` is determined, we might need to adjust how we decide whether it's a declaration or not.\n\nWait, in the original code, after determining `valueType`, it checks if `valueType` is null. If so, it tries to get the type from `rhsValue`. Then, it handles the 'prototype' case.\n\nAfter that, if `valueType` is still null, it adds a stub or returns. Otherwise, it proceeds to determine if it's an inferred type or a declaration.\n\nThe problem is that when the property is reassigned to a new function, the code doesn't recognize this as a new declaration. So, the `inferred` flag might not be set correctly.\n\nLooking at the code, the `inferred` variable is set based on whether the info has certain annotations or if it's a function literal that hasn't been declared before.\n\nI think the solution is to add a condition where, if `rhsValue` is a function, we treat it as a declaration. So, perhaps in the part where `inferred` is being determined, we can add a check for `rhsValue` being a function and whether it's a new assignment.\n\nWait, the suggestion says to add a new condition that checks if `rhsValue` is a function. So, in the code, after determining `valueType`, maybe we can add a check: if `rhsValue` is a function, then treat it as a new function declaration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the section where `inferred` is being calculated, we can adjust the condition to account for reassignment.\n\nLet me think about the flow. When the property is reassigned to a new function, `rhsValue` is a function. So, in the code, when `rhsValue` is a function, it's a declaration if it's either the first time or if it's a new function.\n\nSo, in the code, after the `if (valueType == null && rhsValue != null)` block, perhaps we can add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, we set `inferred` to false because it's a declaration.\n\nWait, looking at the code, after getting `valueType`, it checks if it's null. If so, it tries to get the type from `rhsValue`. Then, it handles the prototype case.\n\nThen, if `valueType` is still null, it adds a stub or returns. Otherwise, it proceeds.\n\nIn the part where `inferred` is determined, it first checks if `info` is not null and certain conditions. Then, it checks if `rhsValue` is a function and whether it's a new declaration.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that when the function is reassigned, the `info` might not have the necessary annotations, so the code treats it as inferred when it shouldn't.\n\nSo, maybe the fix is to add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration, thus setting `inferred` to false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the section where `inferred` is being set, we can add an additional condition: if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nThe code sets `inferred` to true initially. Then, if `info` is not null and has certain properties, it sets `inferred` to false. Then, it checks if `rhsValue` is a function and whether it's a new declaration, setting `inferred` to false in that case.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, perhaps the `info` is null because there's no JSDoc, so the first part doesn't set `inferred` to false. Then, the second part checks if `rhsValue` is a function and if `info` is null or if the property hasn't been declared before.\n\nWait, the code says:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nSo, if `rhsValue` is a function, and either `info` is not null or the property hasn't been declared, then `inferred` becomes false.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, the property has already been declared, so `scope.isDeclared(qName, false)` would return true, making the condition `info != null || !scope.isDeclared(...)` evaluate to `info != null || false`, which is just `info != null`.\n\nIf `info` is null, then the condition becomes false, so `inferred` remains true.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, we want to treat it as a declaration, so `inferred` should be false.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is incorrect. It should treat the assignment as a declaration even if the property was previously declared, as long as the new value is a function.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because sometimes assignments are just inferred types. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to treat any function assignment as a declaration, regardless of whether it's been declared before.\n\nBut that might not be correct either, because sometimes functions are assigned in a way that's not a declaration.\n\nWait, the original problem is that when a function is reassigned, the type isn't updated. So, the code needs to recognize that this is a new function declaration and update the type accordingly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration, thus setting `inferred` to false.\n\nBut how to integrate that into the existing code.\n\nLooking back, the `inferred` variable is set in two steps. First, based on `info`, then based on `rhsValue` being a function.\n\nSo, perhaps in the second step, we can modify the condition to always treat function assignments as declarations, unless certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should not check whether the property has been declared before. Because even if it has, reassigning it to a new function should be treated as a new declaration.\n\nSo, in the code, the line is:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nThis sets `inferred` to false if `rhsValue` is a function and either `info` is not null or the property hasn't been declared.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, the property has been declared, so `scope.isDeclared(qName, false)` is true, making the condition `info != null || false` which is `info != null`. So, if `info` is null, the condition is false, so `inferred` remains true.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, we want `inferred` to be false because it's a new function declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to not check `scope.isDeclared(qName, false)` when `rhsValue` is a function. Or, perhaps we can add an additional condition.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when reassigning a function, `info` is null because there's no JSDoc, so the first part of the `inferred` calculation doesn't set it to false. Then, in the second part, since the property has been declared before, `scope.isDeclared(qName, false)` is true, so the condition becomes `info != null || false`, which is false. So, `inferred` remains true, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps we can modify the condition to not consider whether the property has been declared before when `rhsValue` is a function. Or, perhaps we can add another condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || (scope.isDeclared(qName, false) == false)));\n\nWait, no, that would be the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) || someOtherCondition));\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to treat any function assignment as a declaration, regardless of whether it's been declared before.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition can be simplified to:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || true));\n\nBut that would make `inferred` false for any function assignment, which might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the original condition is incorrect. The comment says that function literals are declarations if they have JSDoc or haven't been declared before.\n\nSo, in the case of reassignment, the function has been declared before, so it's inferred. But in reality, the reassignment should be treated as a new declaration.\n\nHmm, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to treat function assignments as declarations even if the property was previously declared.\n\nBut that might not be correct in all cases. For example, if a function is assigned as a parameter, it's not a declaration.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when the rhsValue is a function, it's a declaration if it's the first assignment or if it's a new function (even if the property was declared before).\n\nBut how can we determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code doesn't reset the type information when the property is reassigned to a new function. So, in the case where `rhsValue` is a function, regardless of previous declarations, we should treat it as a new declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, after determining `valueType`, we can add a condition: if `rhsValue` is a function, then set `inferred` to false, meaning it's a declaration.\n\nBut I need to integrate this into the existing logic.\n\nLooking at the code, after the `valueType` is determined, the code proceeds to handle the 'prototype' case. Then, if `valueType` is null, it adds a stub or returns.\n\nOtherwise, it calculates `inferred`.\n\nSo, perhaps after the `valueType` is determined, we can add a condition:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nBut that might not be correct because sometimes function assignments are inferred.\n\nWait, but according to the comment, function literals are declarations if they have JSDoc or haven't been declared before. So, perhaps the condition is correct, but in the case of reassignment, the code doesn't recognize it as a new function.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that when the function is reassigned, `scope.isDeclared(qName, false)` returns true, so the condition doesn't treat it as a declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to modify the condition to treat function assignments as declarations even if the property was declared before.\n\nWait, but that might cause other issues. For example, if a function is assigned multiple times, each time should be treated as a new declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should not check whether the property has been declared before when `rhsValue` is a function.\n\nSo, in the code, the line:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nWe can modify this to remove the `!scope.isDeclared(qName, false)` part, so it's:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null));\n\nBut wait, that would mean that any function assignment with info not null is a declaration, but if info is null, it's inferred.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment without JSDoc, info is null, so `inferred` would be true, which is not desired.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to treat any function assignment as a declaration, regardless of previous declarations, as long as it's a function.\n\nBut that might not be correct because sometimes functions are assigned in a way that's not a declaration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration unless it's an assignment in a context where it's not a declaration.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to capture that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code doesn't handle the case where the property is being reassigned to a new function, so the type information isn't updated. So, the fix is to add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then treat it as a declaration, thus setting `inferred` to false.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, after determining `inferred` based on `info`, we can add an additional condition:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nBut I need to see where to place this.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nAfter the `if (valueType == null)` block, it handles the prototype case.\n\nThen, if `valueType` is null, it adds a stub or returns.\n\nOtherwise, it proceeds to determine `inferred`.\n\nSo, perhaps after the `inferred` is determined, we can add:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nBut wait, that might override the previous `inferred` value incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be integrated into the existing `inferred` calculation.\n\nAnother approach is to adjust the condition where `inferred` is set based on `rhsValue` being a function.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) || scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || true));\n\nBut that would make `inferred` false for any function assignment, which might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction());\n\nBut that would treat all function assignments as declarations, which might be too aggressive.\n\nWait, perhaps the original condition is incorrect. The comment says that function literals are declarations if they have JSDoc or haven't been declared before. So, the condition should be:\n\nif (rhsValue is function and (has JSDoc or not declared before)) \u2192 declaration.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment, it's declared before, so it's inferred. But in reality, the reassignment should be treated as a new declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is wrong. Maybe function assignments should always be treated as declarations, regardless of previous declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code doesn't recognize that the function is being reassigned and thus doesn't update the type.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration, regardless of previous state.\n\nSo, in the code, after the initial `inferred` calculation, we can add:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nBut I need to make sure this is placed correctly.\n\nLooking at the code, after the `inferred` is calculated, the code proceeds to handle the declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps adding this condition after the `inferred` is initially set would help.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Calculate `inferred` based on `info` and `rhsValue` being a function and whether it's been declared.\n\n2. Then, if `rhsValue` is a function, set `inferred` to false.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because sometimes function assignments are inferred.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be that if `rhsValue` is a function and it's not a method assignment, then treat it as a declaration.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to add a new condition before the `inferred` calculation. For example, if `rhsValue` is a function, then treat it as a declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter determining `valueType`, check if `rhsValue` is a function. If so, set `inferred` to false.\n\nWait, but that might interfere with other parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to add a new condition in the `inferred` calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to modify the condition where `inferred` is set when `rhsValue` is a function. Instead of checking whether the property has been declared before, we can treat any function assignment as a declaration.\n\nSo, the condition would be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null));\n\nThis way, if `rhsValue` is a function and `info` is not null, it's a declaration. But if `info` is null, it's inferred.\n\nBut in the case of reassignment without JSDoc, `info` is null, so `inferred` would be true, which is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the code doesn't recognize that the function is being reassigned, so it's not updating the type.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration, regardless of `info` or previous declarations.\n\nSo, in the code, after calculating `inferred` based on `info`, we can add:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis would ensure that any function assignment is treated as a declaration.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this would cause other issues. For example, if a function is assigned as a parameter, it's not a declaration, but this change would treat it as one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be more nuanced. Maybe only treat it as a declaration if it's an assignment to a property, not a parameter or something else.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to capture that in the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to add a new condition in the `inferred` calculation that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration, unless it's a method assignment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the function is reassigned, the code doesn't recognize it as a new function, so the type isn't updated. So, the solution is to add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, then it's a declaration, thus setting `inferred` to false.\n\nSo, in the code, after the initial `inferred` calculation, add:\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\nThis would ensure that any function assignment is treated as a declaration.\n\nBut I need to make sure this doesn't break other cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be placed earlier, before the `inferred` is calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the condition where `inferred` is set based on `rhsValue` being a function.\n\nSo, in the code, the line:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nWe can modify this to:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || !scope.isDeclared(qName, false) || scope.isDeclared(qName, false)));\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because it would always be true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction() && (info != null || true));\n\nBut that would make `inferred` false for any function assignment, which might be what we want.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction());\n\nWhich would treat any function assignment as a declaration.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, looking back at the original problem, the issue is that when a function is reassigned, the code doesn't update the type information. So, the function is treated as the old type instead of the new one.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that when the property is reassigned to a new function, it's treated as a new declaration, thus updating the type.\n\nTherefore, in the code, when `rhsValue` is a function, regardless of previous declarations, it should be treated as a declaration.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be modified to:\n\ninferred = !(rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction());\n\nThis way, any function assignment is treated as a declaration.\n\nBut I need to check if this would cause other issues.\n\nFor example, if a function is assigned as a parameter in a function call, it's not a declaration, but this change would treat it as one.\n\nBut in the context of this function, `maybeDeclareQualifiedName`, it's called when a qualified name is being declared, so perhaps it's correct to treat function assignments as declarations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is only called in contexts where assignments are declarations.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fix is to add a new condition after the `inferred` is calculated. So, after the initial `inferred` calculation, if `rhsValue` is a function, set `inferred` to false.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\n// ... existing code ...\n\nboolean inferred = true;\nif (info != null) {\n    inferred = !(info.hasType() || ... );\n}\n\nif (rhsValue != null && rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    inferred = false;\n}\n\n// ... rest of the code ...\n\nThis would ensure that any function assignment is treated as a declaration.\n\nI think this is the way to go. So, in the code, after calculating `inferred` based on `info`, we add a condition that if `rhsValue` is a function, set `inferred` to false.\n\nThis way, when the property is reassigned to a new function, it's treated as a declaration, and the type is updated accordingly.\n\nSo, the modified code would include this additional condition.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to write the fixed function with this change.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` does not correctly handle property reassignment to a new function, we need to ensure that such reassignments are treated as new declarations. This involves adding a condition to check if the `rhsValue` is a function and, if so, treat it as a declaration by setting `inferred` to `false`.\n\nHere is the corrected implementation:\n\n```java\nvoid maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n  Node ownerNode = n.getFirstChild();\n  String ownerName = ownerNode.getQualifiedName();\n  String qName = n.getQualifiedName();\n  String propName = n.getLastChild().getString();\n  Preconditions.checkArgument(qName != null && ownerName != null);\n\n  // Precedence of type information on GETPROPs:\n  // 1) @type annotation / @enum annotation\n  // 2) ASSIGN to FUNCTION literal\n  //"
