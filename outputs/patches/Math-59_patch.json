      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is the incorrect implementation of the `max` function. The function is supposed to return the maximum of two values, but it has a flawed logic. The function checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b` and returns `b` if true. However, it also checks if `a + b` is NaN, and if so, returns `b`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the case where `a` is greater than `b` but `a + b` is NaN. In the test case that fails, `a` is 50.0 and `b` is -50.0, and `a + b` is not NaN, but the function still returns `b` instead of `a`.\nSuggestion: Simplify the Logic\nThe simplest fix is to remove the unnecessary check for `Float.isNaN(a + b)` and simply return `a` if it is greater than `b`, and `b` otherwise. This fix is straightforward and easy to understand. The corrected code is:\n```java\npublic static float max(final float a, final float b) {\n    return (a > b) ? a : b;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static float max(final float a, final float b) {\n    return (a <= b) ? b : (Float.isNaN(a + b) ? Float.NaN : b);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This fix requires more careful consideration of the edge cases. The corrected code is:\n```java\npublic static float max(final float a, final float b) {\n    if (Float.isNaN(a) || Float.isNaN(b)) {\n        return Float.NaN;\n    }\n    return (a > b) ? a : b;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static float max(final float a, final float b) {\n    return (a <= b) ? b : (Float.isNaN(a + b) ?
