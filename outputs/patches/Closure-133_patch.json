      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the issue is likely due to the fact that the `getRemainingJSDocLine` function is not correctly handling the case where the JSDoc comment has a syntax error. The function is simply delegating to the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine` method without any error checking or handling. This is causing the position information to be recorded incorrectly, leading to the `IllegalStateException`.\nSuggestion: Add Error Handling\nOne potential fix is to add error handling to the `getRemainingJSDocLine` function. This could involve checking the result of the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine` method and handling any errors that occur. For example, the function could return an empty string or throw a custom exception if an error occurs.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n  String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n  return result;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is causing the position information to be recorded incorrectly, leading to the `IllegalStateException`.\nSuggestion: Validate Position Information\nAnother potential fix is to validate the position information before recording it. This could involve checking that the start character position is less than or equal to the end character position, and throwing an exception if this is not the case.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n  String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n  return result;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function is simply delegating to the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine` method without any error checking or handling. This is causing the position information to be recorded incorrectly, leading to the `IllegalStateException`.\nSuggestion: Handle Syntax Errors\nA third potential fix is to handle syntax errors in the JSDoc comment. This could involve parsing the comment and checking for syntax errors before attempting to record the position information. If a syntax error is found, the function could return an error message or throw a custom exception.\n\nHere is the final solution in code format:\n\n```java\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n  try {\n    String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n    // Validate position information\n    if (result != null && result.length() > 0) {\n      int startCharNo = stream.getStartCharNo();\n      int endCharNo = stream.getEndCharNo();\n      if (startCharNo > endCharNo) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Recorded bad position information\");\n      }\n    }\n    return result;\n  } catch (Exception e) {\n    // Handle error\n    return \"\";\n  }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n  String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n  return result;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
