      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is not properly handling the case where the Jacobian matrix is singular or nearly singular. This can cause the algorithm to converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum.\nSuggestion: Add Singularity Check\nOne possible fix is to add a check for singularity or near-singularity of the Jacobian matrix after it is computed. If the matrix is singular or nearly singular, the algorithm can use a different method to compute the update direction, such as the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This can be done by adding a small function that checks the condition number of the Jacobian matrix and returns a flag indicating whether the matrix is singular or not. If the matrix is singular, the algorithm can use the pseudoinverse to compute the update direction.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected VectorialPointValuePair doOptimize()\n    throws FunctionEvaluationException, OptimizationException, IllegalArgumentException {\n\n    // arrays shared with the other private methods\n    solvedCols  = Math.min(rows, cols);\n    diagR       = new double[cols];\n    jacNorm     = new double[cols];\n    beta        = new double[cols];\n    permutation = new int[cols];\n    lmDir       = new double[cols];\n\n    // local point\n    double   delta   = 0;\n    double   xNorm   = 0;\n    double[] diag    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldX    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldRes  = new double[rows];\n    double[] work1   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work2   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work3   = new double[cols];\n\n    // evaluate the function at the starting point and calculate its norm\n    updateResidualsAndCost();\n\n    // outer loop\n    lmPar = 0;\n    boolean firstIteration = true;\n    VectorialPointValuePair current = new VectorialPointValuePair(point, objective);\n    while (true) {\n        incrementIterationsCounter();\n\n        // compute the Q.R. decomposition of the jacobian matrix\n        VectorialPointValuePair previous = current;\n        updateJacobian();\n        qrDecomposition();\n\n        // compute Qt.res\n        qTy(residuals);\n        // now we don't need Q anymore,\n        // so let jacobian contain the R matrix with its diagonal elements\n        for (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n            int pk = permutation[k];\n            jacobian[k][pk] = diagR[pk];\n        }\n\n        if (firstIteration) {\n\n            // scale the point according to the norms of the columns\n            // of the initial jacobian\n            xNorm = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {\n                double dk = jacNorm[k];\n                if (dk == 0) {\n                    dk = 1.0;\n                }\n                double xk = dk * point[k];\n                xNorm  += xk * xk;\n                diag[k] = dk;\n            }\n            xNorm = Math.sqrt(xNorm);\n\n            // initialize the step bound delta\n            delta = (xNorm == 0) ?

      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is not properly handling the case where the Jacobian matrix is singular or nearly singular. This can cause the algorithm to converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum.\nSuggestion: Modify the Levenberg-Marquardt Parameter Update\nA third possible fix is to modify the way the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter is updated. Instead of using a fixed value for the parameter, it can be updated based on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. If the condition number is large, the parameter can be increased to reduce the step size and prevent the algorithm from converging to a local minimum. This can be done by adding a small function that computes the condition number of the Jacobian matrix and updates the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter accordingly.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected VectorialPointValuePair doOptimize()\n    throws FunctionEvaluationException, OptimizationException, IllegalArgumentException {\n\n    // arrays shared with the other private methods\n    solvedCols  = Math.min(rows, cols);\n    diagR       = new double[cols];\n    jacNorm     = new double[cols];\n    beta        = new double[cols];\n    permutation = new int[cols];\n    lmDir       = new double[cols];\n\n    // local point\n    double   delta   = 0;\n    double   xNorm   = 0;\n    double[] diag    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldX    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldRes  = new double[rows];\n    double[] work1   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work2   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work3   = new double[cols];\n\n    // evaluate the function at the starting point and calculate its norm\n    updateResidualsAndCost();\n\n    // outer loop\n    lmPar = 0;\n    boolean firstIteration = true;\n    VectorialPointValuePair current = new VectorialPointValuePair(point, objective);\n    while (true) {\n        incrementIterationsCounter();\n\n        // compute the Q.R. decomposition of the jacobian matrix\n        VectorialPointValuePair previous = current;\n        updateJacobian();\n        qrDecomposition();\n\n        // compute Qt.res\n        qTy(residuals);\n        // now we don't need Q anymore,\n        // so let jacobian contain the R matrix with its diagonal elements\n        for (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n            int pk = permutation[k];\n            jacobian[k][pk] = diagR[pk];\n        }\n\n        if (firstIteration) {\n\n            // scale the point according to the norms of the columns\n            // of the initial jacobian\n            xNorm = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {\n                double dk = jacNorm[k];\n                if (dk == 0) {\n                    dk = 1.0;\n                }\n                double xk = dk * point[k];\n                xNorm  += xk * xk;\n                diag[k] = dk;\n            }\n            xNorm = Math.sqrt(xNorm);\n\n            // initialize the step bound delta\n            delta = (xNorm == 0) ?

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the provided Levenberg-Marquardt optimization function. The root cause is that the algorithm doesn't handle singular or nearly singular Jacobian matrices properly, leading to convergence issues. The suggestion is to add a singularity check and use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse when necessary.\n\nFirst, I'll review the original code to understand where the Jacobian is used. The function computes the QR decomposition of the Jacobian matrix, which gives the R matrix stored in jacobian. If R is singular, the current approach might fail.\n\nI need to add a function to check if the Jacobian is singular. This can be done by checking the condition number of the matrix. If the condition number is too large, the matrix is nearly singular.\n\nI'll create a helper method called isSingular that calculates the condition number. The condition number is the ratio of the largest to smallest singular values, but since QR decomposition gives us the diagonal of R, which are the singular values, I can use those. If the smallest singular value is zero or too small, the matrix is singular.\n\nIn the code, after computing the QR decomposition, I'll call isSingular. If it returns true, I'll compute the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian. Otherwise, proceed as before.\n\nWait, how is the Jacobian stored? After QR decomposition, jacobian holds the R matrix. So the diagonal elements are the singular values. I can extract these, find the smallest non-zero value, and compute the condition number.\n\nIn the isSingular method, I'll collect the diagonal elements of R, ignore zeros, find the maximum and minimum, and compute the condition number. If it's above a certain threshold (like 1e10), consider it singular.\n\nWhen the Jacobian is singular, instead of using the normal update, I'll compute the pseudoinverse. The pseudoinverse can be approximated by taking the Moore-Penrose form. But since I have the QR decomposition, the pseudoinverse can be computed as R^T Q^T. However, in this code, Q is not stored, so maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, when the Jacobian is singular, I can adjust the update direction using the pseudoinverse. But without Q, perhaps I can construct the pseudoinverse from R. Wait, the QR decomposition gives Q and R such that J = Q R. So J^+ (pseudoinverse) is R^+ R^T Q^T. But R is upper triangular, so R^+ is diagonal with reciprocals of the non-zero diagonals. So, perhaps I can compute the pseudoinverse as R^T inv(R R^T).\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute the least squares solution using the pseudoinverse when the matrix is singular. So, when isSingular returns true, instead of using the current update direction, compute the direction using the pseudoinverse.\n\nSo, in the code, after the QR decomposition, check if the Jacobian is singular. If yes, compute the pseudoinverse and solve for the update direction. Otherwise, proceed with the Levenberg-Marquardt update.\n\nWait, in the original code, after QR, the code computes Qt.res and then forms the R matrix with diagR. So, perhaps I can modify the part where the update direction is computed.\n\nIn the inner loop, the code computes lmDir. If the Jacobian is singular, I need to compute lmDir differently.\n\nSo, steps to modify:\n\n1. After qrDecomposition(), check if the Jacobian is singular using isSingular().\n\n2. If singular, compute the update direction using the pseudoinverse.\n\n3. Else, proceed with the current Levenberg-Marquardt parameter approach.\n\nSo, in the code, after the QR decomposition, I'll add:\n\nif (isSingular()) {\n    computePseudoInverseUpdate();\n} else {\n    determineLMParameter(...);\n    compute lmDir as before.\n}\n\nWait, but the current code computes lmDir in determineLMParameter. So perhaps I need to adjust that part.\n\nAlternatively, after determining that the Jacobian is singular, compute the update direction using the pseudoinverse method.\n\nBut how exactly? Let me think about the mathematics.\n\nIn Levenberg-Marquardt, the update is (J^T J + \u03bb I)^-1 J^T r, where r is the residuals.\n\nWhen J is singular, this can be replaced with J^+ r, where J^+ is the pseudoinverse. But that might not account for the regularization. Alternatively, perhaps when the matrix is singular, we can switch to using the pseudoinverse solution without the regularization.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe when the Jacobian is singular, the standard LM update isn't working, so using the pseudoinverse provides a better direction.\n\nSo, in code, after the QR decomposition, check if singular. If yes, compute the pseudoinverse of J and multiply by residuals to get the direction.\n\nBut how to compute the pseudoinverse? Since we have the QR decomposition, J = Q R, so J^+ = R^+ Q^T. But since R is upper triangular, R^+ can be computed by taking the reciprocal of the non-zero diagonal elements and setting others to zero.\n\nWait, but in the code, after QR decomposition, the jacobian matrix holds R, and permutation holds the permutation from the QR. Also, the qTy function computes Q^T y.\n\nSo, perhaps the pseudoinverse can be computed as R^T (R R^T)^-1 Q^T. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the R matrix, which is upper triangular, we can compute the pseudoinverse by inverting the non-zero elements on the diagonal and setting others to zero, then multiplying by Q^T.\n\nBut without Q, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the least squares solution using the SVD, but that's computationally expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps in the code, after the QR decomposition, when the Jacobian is singular, instead of using the current method to compute lmDir, we can compute it as the solution to the least squares problem using the pseudoinverse.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (isSingular) {\n    // compute pseudoinverse of Jacobian\n    // J is m x n, so pseudoinverse is n x m\n    // the update direction is -J^+ res\n    // but how to compute this without the pseudoinverse matrix?\n\n    // Alternatively, since we have the QR decomposition, we can compute the solution as R^T (R R^T)^-1 Q^T res\n    // But R is upper triangular, so R R^T is diagonal, and its inverse is easy.\n\n    // Let me think: J = Q R, so J^+ res = R^T (R R^T)^-1 Q^T res\n\n    // Compute Q^T res, which is already done as qTy(residuals) and stored in some variable.\n\n    // Wait, in the code, after qrDecomposition, the code calls qTy(residuals), which I think stores the result in residuals.\n\n    // So, after qTy(residuals), residuals is Q^T res.\n\n    // Then, to compute R^T (R R^T)^-1 Q^T res, which is R^T (diagR^2)^-1 (Q^T res)\n\n    // So, for each column in R^T, multiply by 1/(diagR[k]^2) and then multiply by Q^T res.\n\n    // Wait, R is upper triangular, so R^T is lower triangular.\n\n    // So, the solution is to solve the upper triangular system R^T x = (Q^T res), but with each row scaled by 1/(diagR[k]^2).\n\n    // Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the pseudoinverse update direction as follows:\n\n    // Since J = Q R, then the pseudoinverse J^+ is R^+ Q^T, where R^+ is the pseudoinverse of R.\n\n    // R is upper triangular, so R^+ can be constructed by taking the reciprocal of the non-zero diagonal elements and setting the rest to zero.\n\n    // So, for each diagonal element in R, if it's non-zero, take reciprocal, else zero.\n\n    // Then, multiply R^+ by Q^T res.\n\n    // But since Q^T res is already computed as residuals, perhaps we can proceed.\n\n    // So, in code:\n\n    // Compute R^+ as a diagonal matrix with 1/diagR[k] where diagR[k] is non-zero.\n\n    // Then, multiply R^+ with the residuals (which is Q^T res) to get the direction.\n\n    // Wait, but R^+ is n x n, and residuals is n x 1.\n\n    // So, for each j in 0..solvedCols-1, direction[j] = sum over i of R^+[j][i] * residuals[i]\n\n    // But R^+ is diagonal, so direction[j] = R^+[j][j] * residuals[j]\n\n    // So, for each j, if diagR[j] is non-zero, direction[j] = residuals[j] / diagR[j]\n\n    // Else, direction[j] = 0.\n\n    // So, in code:\n\n    for (int j = 0;

So, perhaps in the loop, for each k, diagR[permutation[k]] is the singular value.\n\n    So, in the isSingular method, collect all diagR[p] where p is the permutation indices.\n\n    Alternatively, perhaps it's better to collect all non-zero diagR elements.\n\n    So, in the code:\n\n    private boolean isSingular() {\n        double maxSv = 0.0;\n        double minSv = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n        for (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n            int pk = permutation[k];\n            double sv = diagR[pk];\n            if (sv == 0) {\n                // singular value is zero, matrix is singular\n                return true;\n            }\n            if (sv > maxSv) {\n                maxSv = sv;\n            }\n            if (sv < minSv) {\n                minSv = sv;\n            }\n        }\n        double conditionNumber = maxSv / minSv;\n        return conditionNumber > 1e10;\n    }\n\n    This should handle cases where any singular value is zero (return true) or the condition number is too large.\n\n    So, putting it all together:\n\n    After the QR decomposition, check if isSingular(). If yes, compute the pseudoinverse direction. Else, proceed with LM parameter.\n\n    Now, integrate this into the code.\n\n    Also, need to make sure that when the Jacobian is singular, the update direction is computed correctly.\n\n    So, in the code, after the QR decomposition:\n\n    boolean isSingular = isSingular();\n\n    Then, in the inner loop, before determining the LM parameter, check if isSingular.\n\n    Wait, no. The isSingular check should be done each time after the QR decomposition, which is inside the outer loop.\n\n    So, in the outer loop, after qrDecomposition(), compute isSingular.\n\n    Then, in the inner loop, when computing the direction, decide based on isSingular.\n\n    So, the code structure would be:\n\n    while (true) {\n        // ... outer loop code ...\n\n        updateJacobian();\n        qrDecomposition();\n\n        // compute Qt.res\n        qTy(residuals);\n\n        // ... code to fill jacobian with R matrix ...\n\n        boolean isSingular = isSingular();\n\n        // ... other code ...\n\n        for (double ratio = 0; ratio < 1.0e-4;) {\n\n            // ... save state ...\n\n            if (isSingular) {\n                // compute pseudoinverse direction\n                for (int j = 0; j < solvedCols; ++j) {\n                    int pj = permutation[j];\n                    if (diagR[pj] != 0) {\n                        lmDir[pj] = -residuals[j] / diagR[pj];\n                    } else {\n                        lmDir[pj] = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                determineLMParameter(oldRes, delta, diag, work1, work2, work3);\n                for (int j = 0; j < solvedCols; ++j) {\n                    int pj = permutation[j];\n                    lmDir[pj] = -lmDir[pj];\n                }\n            }\n\n            // compute new point and lmNorm\n            double lmNorm = 0;\n            for (int j = 0; j < solvedCols; ++j) {\n                int pj = permutation[j];\n                point[pj] = oldX[pj] + lmDir[pj];\n                double s = diag[pj] * lmDir[pj];\n                lmNorm += s * s;\n            }\n            lmNorm = Math.sqrt(lmNorm);\n\n            // ... rest of the inner loop code ...\n        }\n    }\n\n    Wait, but in the original code, the determineLMParameter is called inside the inner loop. So, moving the isSingular check inside the inner loop might not be correct because the Jacobian is computed in the outer loop.\n\n    So, perhaps the isSingular check should be done once per outer iteration, not per inner iteration.\n\n    So, the code should be:\n\n    while (true) {\n        // ... outer loop code ...\n\n        updateJacobian();\n        qrDecomposition();\n\n        // compute Qt.res\n        qTy(residuals);\n\n        // ... code to fill jacobian with R matrix ...\n\n        boolean isSingular = isSingular();\n\n        // ... other code ...\n\n        for (double ratio = 0; ratio < 1.0e-4;) {\n\n            // ... save state ...\n\n            if (isSingular) {\n                // compute pseudoinverse direction\n                for (int j = 0; j < solvedCols; ++j) {\n                    int pj = permutation[j];\n                    if (diagR[pj] != 0) {\n                        lmDir[pj] = -residuals[j] / diagR[pj];\n                    } else {\n                        lmDir[pj] = 0;\n                    }\n                }\n            } else {\n                determineLMParameter(oldRes, delta, diag, work1, work2, work3);\n                for (int j = 0; j < solvedCols; ++j) {\n                    int pj = permutation[j];\n                    lmDir[pj] = -lmDir[pj];\n                }\n            }\n\n            // ... compute new point and lmNorm ...\n\n            // ... evaluate function and compute ratio ...\n\n            // ... update step bound and LM parameter ...\n\n            // ... check convergence ...\n        }\n    }\n\n    So, in each outer iteration, after QR, check if singular. Then, in the inner loop, use that flag to decide the direction.\n\n    Now, I need to implement the isSingular method as a helper function.\n\n    Also, I should test if this change resolves the issue where the Jacobian is singular, preventing the algorithm from converging.\n\n    Another consideration: when using the pseudoinverse, the step might be too large, so perhaps the delta should be adjusted accordingly. But in the code, delta is already being managed based on the ratio.\n\n    So, the main changes are:\n\n    1. Add the isSingular helper method.\n\n    2. After QR decomposition, compute isSingular.\n\n    3. In the inner loop, if isSingular is true, compute the pseudoinverse direction; else, proceed with LM parameter.\n\n    Now, I'll write the fixed code incorporating these changes.\n</think>\n\n```java\nprotected VectorialPointValuePair doOptimize()\n    throws FunctionEvaluationException, OptimizationException, IllegalArgumentException {\n\n    // arrays shared with the other private methods\n    solvedCols  = Math.min(rows, cols);\n    diagR       = new double[cols];\n    jacNorm     = new double[cols];\n    beta        = new double[cols];\n    permutation = new int[cols];\n    lmDir       = new double[cols];\n\n    // local point\n    double   delta   = 0;\n    double   xNorm   = 0;\n    double[] diag    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldX    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldRes  = new double[rows];\n    double[] work1   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work2   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work3   = new double[cols];\n\n    // evaluate the function at the starting point and calculate its norm\n    updateResidualsAndCost();\n\n    // outer loop\n    lmPar = 0;\n    boolean firstIteration = true;\n    VectorialPointValuePair current = new VectorialPointValuePair(point, objective);\n    while (true) {\n        incrementIterationsCounter();\n\n        // compute the Q.R. decomposition of the jacobian matrix\n        VectorialPointValuePair previous = current;\n        updateJacobian();\n        qrDecomposition();\n\n        // compute Qt.res\n        qTy(residuals);\n        // now we don't need Q anymore,\n        // so let jacobian contain the R matrix with its diagonal elements\n        for (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n            int pk = permutation[k];\n            jacobian[k][pk] = diagR[pk];\n        }\n\n        boolean isSingular = isSingular();\n\n        if (firstIteration) {\n\n            // scale the point according to the norms of the columns\n            // of the initial jacobian\n            xNorm = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {\n                double dk = jacNorm[k];\n                if (dk == 0) {\n                    dk = 1.0;\n                }\n                double xk = dk * point[k];\n                xNorm  += xk * xk;\n                diag[k] = dk;\n            }\n            xNorm = Math.sqrt(xNorm);\n\n            // initialize the step bound delta\n            delta = (xNorm == 0) ? initialStepBoundFactor : (initialStepBoundFactor * xNorm);\n\n        }\n\n        // check orthogonality between function vector and jacobian columns",

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the provided Levenberg-Marquardt optimization function. The root cause is that the algorithm isn't handling singular or nearly singular Jacobian matrices well, leading to local minima instead of global. The suggestion is to update the LM parameter based on the Jacobian's condition number.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the current LM parameter is determined. Looking at the code, there's a method called determineLMParameter which probably sets lmPar. But right now, it might not be considering the condition number.\n\nThe fix is to compute the condition number of the Jacobian and adjust lmPar accordingly. If the condition number is large (meaning the matrix is ill-conditioned), we should increase lmPar to reduce the step size.\n\nI need to add a function to compute the condition number. The condition number for a matrix is the ratio of the largest to smallest singular values. But since we have the Jacobian decomposed into QR, the singular values are the square roots of the diagonal elements of R^T R, which are stored in diagR.\n\nWait, in QR decomposition, the diagonal elements of R are the singular values squared? Or maybe the diagR array holds the diagonal of R, which are the singular values. So the condition number would be the maximum diagR divided by the minimum diagR.\n\nBut wait, diagR is the diagonal of R after QR decomposition. So the singular values are the diagonal elements of R. So the condition number \u03ba is max(diagR) / min(diagR).\n\nSo I can compute \u03ba by finding the maximum and minimum values in diagR.\n\nI should compute this after the QR decomposition. So after the qrDecomposition() call, I can add code to calculate the condition number.\n\nOnce I have \u03ba, I can adjust lmPar. If \u03ba is large, increase lmPar. Maybe set lmPar to something like \u03ba * initialLmPar or similar. Or perhaps multiply lmPar by \u03ba when \u03ba exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nLooking at the current determineLMParameter method, I'm not sure how it's implemented. But in the fixed function, I can modify it or add the condition number calculation before calling it.\n\nWait, in the provided code, determineLMParameter is called with oldRes, delta, diag, work1, work2, work3. So perhaps I should compute the condition number before this call and pass it as an argument or adjust lmPar based on it.\n\nAlternatively, after computing the condition number, I can adjust lmPar inside the loop.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. After qrDecomposition(), compute the condition number \u03ba of the Jacobian.\n2. Use \u03ba to adjust lmPar. For example, if \u03ba is large, increase lmPar to make the steps smaller.\n3. Ensure that this adjustment is done in each iteration so that lmPar adapts as the Jacobian changes.\n\nSo in the code, after the qrDecomposition() call, I'll add code to compute \u03ba.\n\nLet me think about how to compute \u03ba:\n\n- Find the maximum and minimum values in diagR.\n- \u03ba = max / min.\n- But if min is zero, that would be a problem. So perhaps we add a small epsilon to avoid division by zero.\n\nWait, diagR is the diagonal of R, which should have non-zero elements since QR decomposition is for full rank matrices. But in case of numerical issues, maybe some are very small.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndouble maxDiagR = 0;\ndouble minDiagR = Double.MAX_VALUE;\nfor (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n    if (diagR[k] > maxDiagR) {\n        maxDiagR = diagR[k];\n    }\n    if (diagR[k] < minDiagR) {\n        minDiagR = diagR[k];\n    }\n}\ndouble conditionNumber = maxDiagR / minDiagR;\n\nBut wait, if minDiagR is zero, this would cause division by zero. So perhaps we set a minimum threshold, like if minDiagR is below a certain value, treat it as that value.\n\nAlternatively, compute the condition number only if minDiagR is not zero. Otherwise, maybe the matrix is singular, and we can handle that case differently.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed under the assumption that diagR contains non-zero values.\n\nOnce I have conditionNumber, I can adjust lmPar. For example, if conditionNumber is larger than a certain threshold (like 1e4), then multiply lmPar by a factor, say 10, to increase damping.\n\nAlternatively, set lmPar to be proportional to the condition number. Maybe lmPar = lmPar * conditionNumber or something similar.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to make lmPar too large, which could cause the algorithm to take too small steps and stagnate.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the initial lmPar based on the condition number. So instead of starting lmPar at 0, set it to a value that depends on the condition number.\n\nWait, looking at the code, lmPar is initialized to 0 at the start of the outer loop. Then, in determineLMParameter, it's being set based on some criteria.\n\nSo perhaps in the determineLMParameter method, we can pass the condition number and adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nBut since I can't modify the method signature, maybe I should compute the condition number before calling determineLMParameter and then adjust lmPar after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the determineLMParameter method can be modified to take the condition number into account.\n\nBut since the original code is provided and I'm to fix it, perhaps I can add the condition number calculation and then adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nSo, in the code, after qrDecomposition(), compute conditionNumber as above.\n\nThen, in the determineLMParameter call, perhaps pass conditionNumber as an argument, but since the method signature can't change, maybe adjust lmPar after.\n\nWait, perhaps after calling determineLMParameter, I can adjust lmPar based on conditionNumber.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value of lmPar should be set based on the condition number.\n\nWait, in the current code, lmPar is initialized to 0 at the start of the outer loop. Then, in determineLMParameter, it's set based on some other factors.\n\nSo perhaps after determineLMParameter is called, I can adjust lmPar by multiplying it with the conditionNumber if it's large.\n\nBut I'm not sure how determineLMParameter works. Maybe it's better to compute the condition number and then adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nAfter the qrDecomposition() call, compute the condition number.\n\nThen, adjust lmPar based on this condition number.\n\nFor example:\n\nif (conditionNumber > 1000) {\n    lmPar *= 10;\n}\n\nBut I need to test this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set lmPar to be the maximum between its current value and conditionNumber multiplied by a factor.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the initial lmPar as the maximum between the current initial value and the condition number.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe in the first iteration, when lmPar is 0, we can set it to a value based on the condition number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial lmPar can be set to the condition number, but that might be too aggressive.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LM parameter should be updated dynamically based on the condition number each iteration.\n\nSo, each time after computing the condition number, adjust lmPar.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact adjustment factor. Maybe if the condition number is high, increase lmPar to make the steps smaller, thus preventing large steps that could lead to local minima.\n\nSo, perhaps in code:\n\ncompute conditionNumber as above.\n\nif (conditionNumber > 1e4) {\n    lmPar *= 10;\n}\n\nBut I need to ensure that this doesn't cause lmPar to become too large, which might slow down convergence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set lmPar to be the maximum of its current value and conditionNumber multiplied by a scaling factor.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact scaling factor. Maybe 0.1 or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps lmPar should be set to the condition number times a small factor, like 0.01, but only if it's not already larger.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is: if the Jacobian is ill-conditioned (high condition number), then we need to increase the LM parameter to make the steps smaller, thus making the algorithm more like gradient descent with smaller steps, which might help avoid local minima.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndouble conditionNumber = computeConditionNumber();\nif (conditionNumber > 1000) {\n    lmPar = Math.max(lmPar, conditionNumber * 0.1);\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact threshold and multiplier. Maybe 1000 is too arbitrary. Perhaps a relative threshold based on the current state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LM parameter should be adjusted proportionally to the condition number each iteration.\n\nBut I'm not certain about the exact implementation. However, the main idea is to compute the condition number and adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, I'll add code to compute the condition number after the QR decomposition and then adjust lmPar.\n\nLet me outline the steps in the code:\n\n1. After qrDecomposition(), compute max and min of diagR.\n\n2. Compute conditionNumber = maxDiagR / minDiagR.\n\n3. Adjust lmPar based on conditionNumber.\n\nSo, in the code, after the for loop that sets jacobian[k][pk] = diagR[pk], I'll add:\n\n// Compute condition number of R matrix (Jacobian)\ndouble maxDiagR = 0.0;\ndouble minDiagR = Double.MAX_VALUE;\nfor (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n    if (diagR[k] > maxDiagR) {\n        maxDiagR = diagR[k];\n    }\n    if (diagR[k] < minDiagR) {\n        minDiagR = diagR[k];\n    }\n}\ndouble conditionNumber = maxDiagR / minDiagR;\n\n// Adjust LM parameter based on condition number\nif (conditionNumber > 1e4) { // Arbitrary threshold, may need tuning\n    lmPar *= 10.0;\n}\n\nBut wait, lmPar is initialized to 0 at the start of the outer loop. So in the first iteration, after QR, conditionNumber is computed, and if it's high, lmPar is set to 0 *10 = 0. That doesn't help.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial lmPar should be set based on the condition number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first iteration, if conditionNumber is high, set lmPar to a value based on that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial lmPar is 0, but after computing conditionNumber, we can set it to something like max(0.001 * conditionNumber, 1.0), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first iteration, if conditionNumber is large, set lmPar to a higher initial value.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact approach. Maybe the key is to ensure that when the Jacobian is ill-conditioned, the LM parameter is increased to prevent large steps.\n\nAnother approach is to modify the determineLMParameter method to take into account the condition number, but since I can't change the method's parameters, perhaps I need to compute it before and adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after calling determineLMParameter, I can adjust lmPar based on the condition number.\n\nWait, in the code, after determineLMParameter is called, lmPar is set. So perhaps after that, I can adjust it.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndetermineLMParameter(...);\n// Now adjust lmPar based on condition number\nif (conditionNumber > 1e4) {\n    lmPar *= 10.0;\n}\n\nBut again, I'm not sure about the exact adjustment factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LM parameter should be set to the maximum of its current value and the condition number multiplied by a factor.\n\nBut without knowing the exact implementation of determineLMParameter, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value of lmPar should be set to the condition number in the first iteration.\n\nBut in the current code, lmPar is initialized to 0 at the start of the outer loop.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first iteration, after computing conditionNumber, if it's large, set lmPar to a higher value.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (firstIteration) {\n    if (conditionNumber > 1000) {\n        lmPar = conditionNumber * 0.1;\n    }\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LM parameter should be dynamically adjusted each iteration based on the condition number.\n\nAnother thought: the condition number affects the stability of the solution. A high condition number means that small changes in the residuals can lead to large changes in the parameters, making the problem ill-posed. So, increasing the LM parameter (which adds a damping term to the Hessian) can help stabilize the updates.\n\nSo, perhaps each time the condition number is high, we should increase the LM parameter to make the steps smaller.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll add code to compute the condition number after QR decomposition and adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, after the QR decomposition, compute conditionNumber, then adjust lmPar.\n\nI'll also need to handle the case where minDiagR is zero to avoid division by zero. So perhaps set minDiagR to a very small value if it's zero.\n\nWait, in the QR decomposition, the diagonal elements of R should be non-zero if the matrix is full rank. But numerically, they could be very small, leading to a large condition number.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndouble maxDiagR = 0.0;\ndouble minDiagR = Double.MAX_VALUE;\nfor (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n    double current = diagR[k];\n    if (current > maxDiagR) {\n        maxDiagR = current;\n    }\n    if (current < minDiagR) {\n        minDiagR = current;\n    }\n}\n// Avoid division by zero\nif (minDiagR == 0) {\n    minDiagR = 1e-10; // arbitrary small value\n}\ndouble conditionNumber = maxDiagR / minDiagR;\n\nThen, adjust lmPar:\n\nif (conditionNumber > 1000) {\n    lmPar *= 10.0;\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure about the threshold. Maybe 1000 is too high or too low. Alternatively, use a relative threshold based on the current state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the condition number and if it's above a certain threshold, increase lmPar by a factor.\n\nBut without knowing the exact behavior of the original function, it's hard to choose the right factor. However, the main idea is to adjust lmPar based on the condition number.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, I'll add the condition number computation and adjust lmPar accordingly.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the adjustment should be done after determineLMParameter is called, because determineLMParameter might set lmPar based on other factors.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute condition number after QR decomposition.\n\n2. Call determineLMParameter as usual.\n\n3. Adjust lmPar based on condition number.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nqrDecomposition();\n\n// Compute condition number\ndouble maxDiagR = 0.0;\ndouble minDiagR = Double.MAX_VALUE;\nfor (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n    double current = diagR[k];\n    if (current > maxDiagR) {\n        maxDiagR = current;\n    }\n    if (current < minDiagR) {\n        minDiagR = current;\n    }\n}\nif (minDiagR == 0) {\n    minDiagR = 1e-10;\n}\ndouble conditionNumber = maxDiagR / minDiagR;\n\ndetermineLMParameter(...);\n\n// Adjust lmPar based on condition number\nif (conditionNumber > 1000) {\n    lmPar *= 10.0;\n}\n\nBut again, the threshold and multiplier are arbitrary. Maybe a better approach is to have lmPar scale with the condition number, perhaps lmPar = lmPar * (conditionNumber / 1000) when conditionNumber exceeds 1000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set lmPar to be the maximum of its current value and conditionNumber multiplied by a small factor.\n\nBut without knowing the exact effect, it's hard to choose. However, the main idea is to make lmPar larger when the condition number is large.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, I'll implement this adjustment.\n\nAnother consideration: in the first iteration, lmPar is 0. So after determineLMParameter, which might set it to a small value, the condition number adjustment can increase it if needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial lmPar should be based on the condition number.\n\nBut perhaps the current approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, to summarize, the fixed function will include:\n\n- After QR decomposition, compute the condition number of the Jacobian.\n\n- Adjust the LM parameter (lmPar) based on the condition number, increasing it if the condition number is large.\n\nThis should help the algorithm handle singular or nearly singular Jacobians better, preventing convergence to local minima.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm doesn't handle singular or nearly singular Jacobian matrices well, we modify the LM parameter update to consider the Jacobian's condition number. This adjustment helps stabilize the algorithm by reducing step sizes when the Jacobian is ill-conditioned.\n\n```java\nprotected VectorialPointValuePair doOptimize()\n    throws FunctionEvaluationException, OptimizationException, IllegalArgumentException {\n\n    // arrays shared with the other private methods\n    solvedCols  = Math.min(rows, cols);\n    diagR       = new double[cols];\n    jacNorm     = new double[cols];\n    beta        = new double[cols];\n    permutation = new int[cols];\n    lmDir       = new double[cols];\n\n    // local point\n    double   delta   = 0;\n    double   xNorm   = 0;\n    double[] diag    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldX    = new double[cols];\n    double[] oldRes  = new double[rows];\n    double[] work1   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work2   = new double[cols];\n    double[] work3   = new double[cols];\n\n    // evaluate the function at the starting point and calculate its norm\n    updateResidualsAndCost();\n\n    // outer loop\n    lmPar = 0;\n    boolean firstIteration = true;\n    VectorialPointValuePair current = new VectorialPointValuePair(point, objective);\n    while (true) {\n        incrementIterationsCounter();\n\n        // compute the Q.R. decomposition of the jacobian matrix\n        VectorialPointValuePair previous = current;\n        updateJacobian();\n        qrDecomposition();\n\n        // compute Qt.res\n        qTy(residuals);\n        // now we don't need Q anymore,\n        // so let jacobian contain the R matrix with its diagonal elements\n        for (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n            int pk = permutation[k];\n            jacobian[k][pk] = diagR[pk];\n        }\n\n        // Compute condition number of the Jacobian matrix\n        double maxDiagR = 0.0;\n        double minDiagR = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n        for (int k = 0; k < solvedCols; ++k) {\n            double current = diagR[k];\n            if (current > maxDiagR) {\n                maxDiagR = current;\n            }\n            if (current < minDiagR) {\n                minDiagR = current;\n            }\n        }\n        // Avoid division by zero\n        if (minDiagR == 0) {\n            minDiagR = 1e-10;\n        }\n        double conditionNumber = maxDiagR / minDiagR;\n\n        if (firstIteration) {\n\n            // scale the point according to the norms of the columns\n            // of the initial jacobian\n            xNorm = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < cols; ++k) {\n                double dk = jacNorm[k];\n                if (dk == 0) {\n                    dk = 1.0;\n                }\n                double xk = dk * point[k];\n                xNorm  += xk * xk;\n                diag[k] = dk;\n            }\n            xNorm = Math.sqrt(xNorm);\n\n            // initialize the step bound delta\n            delta = (xNorm == 0) ?
