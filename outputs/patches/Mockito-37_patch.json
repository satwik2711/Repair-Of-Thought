Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the validate method does not correctly handle the case where the answer is to call the real method on an interface. The method does not check if the invocation is on an interface, and it does not throw a MockitoException when it should. This is because the method only checks if the answer is an instance of ThrowsException, Returns, or DoesNothing, but it does not check if the answer is to call the real method on an interface.\nSuggestion: Add a Check for Interface Invocation\nAdd a check to see if the invocation is on an interface, and if so, throw a MockitoException. This can be done by adding a new if statement to the validate method. The code would look like this:\n```java\nif (invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().isInterface()) {\n    throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface\");\n}\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and easy to implement, and it correctly handles the case where the answer is to call the real method on an interface.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void validate(Answer<?> answer, Invocation invocation) {\n        if (answer instanceof ThrowsException) {\n            validateException((ThrowsException) answer, invocation);\n        }\n        \n        if (answer instanceof Returns) {\n            validateReturnValue((Returns) answer, invocation);\n        }\n        \n        if (answer instanceof DoesNothing) {\n            validateDoNothing((DoesNothing) answer, invocation);\n        }\n        \n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the method only checks if the answer is an instance of ThrowsException, Returns, or DoesNothing, but it does not check if the answer is to call the real method on an interface.\nSuggestion: Modify the ThrowsException Check\nModify the check for ThrowsException to also check if the invocation is on an interface. If it is, throw a MockitoException. This can be done by modifying the existing if statement to include an additional check. The code would look like this:\n```java\nif (answer instanceof ThrowsException && invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().isInterface()) {\n    throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface\");\n}\n```\nThis solution modifies an existing check, which could potentially introduce bugs if not done carefully.

This is because the method only checks if the answer is an instance of ThrowsException, Returns, or DoesNothing, but it does not check if the answer is to call the real method on an interface.\nSuggestion: Add a New Answer Type\nAdd a new answer type, such as CallRealMethodOnInterface, and modify the validate method to check for this type. If it is found, throw a MockitoException. This can be done by adding a new class that implements the Answer interface, and then modifying the validate method to check for this type.
