      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the line `return -u * (1 << k);`. The variable `k` is used to keep track of the number of times `u` and `v` are divided by 2. However, when `u` and `v` are large numbers, the value of `k` can exceed 31, causing an overflow. This results in an incorrect GCD calculation.\nSuggestion: Handle Overflow\nOne possible solution is to add a check for overflow before calculating the GCD. If `k` exceeds 31, we can throw an exception or return an error value. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:\n```java\nif (k > 31) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(\"overflow: gcd is too large\");\n}\nreturn -u * (1 << k);\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, but it may not be suitable for all use cases, as it throws an exception instead of returning a result.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static int gcd(int u, int v) {\n    if (u * v == 0) {\n        return (Math.abs(u) + Math.abs(v));\n    }\n    // keep u and v negative, as negative integers range down to\n    // -2^31, while positive numbers can only be as large as 2^31-1\n    // (i.e. we can't necessarily negate a negative number without\n    // overflow)\n    /* assert u!=0 && v!=0; */\n    if (u > 0) {\n        u = -u;\n    } // make u negative\n    if (v > 0) {\n        v = -v;\n    } // make v negative\n    // B1. [Find power of 2]\n    int k = 0;\n    while ((u & 1) == 0 && (v & 1) == 0 && k < 31) { // while u and v are\n                                                        // both even...\n        u /= 2;\n        v /= 2;\n        k++; // cast out twos.\n    }\n    if (k == 31) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"overflow: gcd is 2^31\");\n    }\n    // B2.

This results in an incorrect GCD calculation.\nSuggestion: Use a Larger Data Type\nAnother possible solution is to use a larger data type, such as `long`, to store the value of `k`. This would allow us to handle larger values of `u` and `v` without overflowing. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:\n```java\nlong k = 0;\nwhile ((u & 1) == 0 && (v & 1) == 0 && k < 63) {\n    u /= 2;\n    v /= 2;\n    k++;\n}\nreturn -u * (1L << k);\n```\nThis solution is more robust than the first one, but it may still overflow for very large values of `u` and `v`.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static int gcd(int u, int v) {\n    if (u * v == 0) {\n        return (Math.abs(u) + Math.abs(v));\n    }\n    // keep u and v negative, as negative integers range down to\n    // -2^31, while positive numbers can only be as large as 2^31-1\n    // (i.e. we can't necessarily negate a negative number without\n    // overflow)\n    /* assert u!=0 && v!=0; */\n    if (u > 0) {\n        u = -u;\n    } // make u negative\n    if (v > 0) {\n        v = -v;\n    } // make v negative\n    // B1.

This results in an incorrect GCD calculation.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Algorithm\nA third possible solution is to use a different algorithm for calculating the GCD, one that is less prone to overflow. For example, we could use the Euclidean algorithm, which is more robust but also slower. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:\n```java\npublic static int gcd(int u, int v) {\n    if (u == 0) return v;\n    if (v == 0) return u;\n    if (u < 0) u = -u;\n    if (v < 0) v = -v;\n    while (u != v) {\n        if (u > v) u -= v;\n        else v -= u;\n    }\n    return u;\n}\n```\nThis solution is the most robust of the three, but it is also the slowest.
