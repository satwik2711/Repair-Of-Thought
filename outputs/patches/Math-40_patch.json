Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the solver gets stuck in an infinite loop when the function value at the guessed root is not a perfect root, and the bracketing interval does not converge. This happens because the solver does not properly handle the case where the function value at the guessed root is not a perfect root, and the bracketing interval does not converge. As a result, the solver keeps evaluating the function at the same points, exceeding the maximal count of evaluations.\nSuggestion: Implement a Convergence Check\nImplement a convergence check after each iteration of the solver. This check can verify whether the bracketing interval has converged to a certain tolerance. If the interval has not converged, the solver can terminate and throw an exception. This fix can prevent the solver from getting stuck in an infinite loop. The convergence check can be implemented by adding a condition to check if the difference between the current bracketing interval and the previous one is less than a certain tolerance.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected double doSolve() {\n\n    // prepare arrays with the first points\n    final double[] x = new double[maximalOrder + 1];\n    final double[] y = new double[maximalOrder + 1];\n    x[0] = getMin();\n    x[1] = getStartValue();\n    x[2] = getMax();\n    verifySequence(x[0], x[1], x[2]);\n\n    // evaluate initial guess\n    y[1] = computeObjectiveValue(x[1]);\n    if (Precision.equals(y[1], 0.0, 1)) {\n        // return the initial guess if it is a perfect root.\n        return x[1];\n    }\n\n    // evaluate first  endpoint\n    y[0] = computeObjectiveValue(x[0]);\n    if (Precision.equals(y[0], 0.0, 1)) {\n        // return the first endpoint if it is a perfect root.\n        return x[0];\n    }\n\n    int nbPoints;\n    int signChangeIndex;\n    if (y[0] * y[1] < 0) {\n\n        // reduce interval if it brackets the root\n        nbPoints        = 2;\n        signChangeIndex = 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        // evaluate second endpoint\n        y[2] = computeObjectiveValue(x[2]);\n        if (Precision.equals(y[2], 0.0, 1)) {\n            // return the second endpoint if it is a perfect root.\n            return x[2];\n        }\n\n        if (y[1] * y[2] < 0) {\n            // use all computed point as a start sampling array for solving\n            nbPoints        = 3;\n            signChangeIndex = 2;\n        } else {\n            throw new NoBracketingException(x[0], x[2], y[0], y[2]);\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // prepare a work array for inverse polynomial interpolation\n    final double[] tmpX = new double[x.length];\n\n    // current tightest bracketing of the root\n    double xA    = x[signChangeIndex - 1];\n    double yA    = y[signChangeIndex - 1];\n    double absYA = FastMath.abs(yA);\n    int agingA   = 0;\n    double xB    = x[signChangeIndex];\n    double yB    = y[signChangeIndex];\n    double absYB = FastMath.abs(yB);\n    int agingB   = 0;\n\n    // search loop\n    while (true) {\n\n        // check convergence of bracketing interval\n        final double xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() +\n                            getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n        if (((xB - xA) <= xTol) || (FastMath.max(absYA, absYB) < getFunctionValueAccuracy())) {\n            switch (allowed) {\n            case ANY_SIDE :\n                return absYA < absYB ?

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this buggy function. The problem is that the solver gets stuck in an infinite loop when the function value at the guessed root isn't a perfect root and the bracketing interval doesn't converge. So, the main issue is the lack of a proper convergence check.\n\nLooking at the original code, I see that there's a while (true) loop. Inside this loop, there's a convergence check that uses xTol and functionValueAccuracy. But maybe this isn't sufficient because if the interval doesn't change enough, it keeps looping.\n\nThe suggestion is to implement a convergence check after each iteration. So, I should add a condition to see if the interval has changed by less than a certain tolerance. If it hasn't, the solver should throw an exception to prevent an infinite loop.\n\nI'll start by adding a variable to track the previous interval. Let's call it previousIntervalWidth. I'll calculate it as xB - xA before the loop starts. Then, inside the loop, after updating xA and xB, I'll compute the currentIntervalWidth. I'll check if the absolute difference between current and previous is below a tolerance. If it is, and the max evaluations are exceeded, throw an exception.\n\nWait, but the function already has a convergence check. Maybe the issue is that the existing check isn't sufficient. Perhaps the interval isn't shrinking enough, so the solver doesn't realize it's stuck.\n\nI think adding a check on the interval width change would help. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Before the loop, store the initial interval width.\n2. Inside the loop, after updating xA and xB, compute the new interval width.\n3. Compare the change in interval width. If it's below a tolerance (like 1e-12) and the maximum evaluations are reached, throw an exception.\n4. Update the previous interval width for the next iteration.\n\nWait, but the function might have a maximum evaluation count. Oh, looking back, the function uses computeObjectiveValue, which I assume counts towards the max evaluations. So, perhaps I should track the number of evaluations and throw when it's exceeded.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the interval hasn't changed significantly after an iteration and then throw.\n\nSo, in the code, after the convergence check, I'll add another check. Let's see:\n\n- After the existing convergence check, calculate the current interval (xB - xA).\n- Compare it with the previous interval. If the difference is less than a tolerance, and the function value accuracy isn't met, then throw an exception.\n\nWait, but how do I track the number of iterations? Maybe the function doesn't have a direct count, but we can introduce a counter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is allowed to run indefinitely until it converges, but without a proper check, it loops forever when stuck.\n\nSo, I'll modify the code as follows:\n\n- Declare variables to track the previous xA and xB before the loop starts.\n- Inside the loop, after updating xA and xB, check if the interval has changed enough.\n- If not, throw an exception.\n\nWait, but the loop is while (true), so I need to add a condition to break or throw when it's not converging.\n\nLet me think about where to place this. After the existing convergence check, perhaps add another condition.\n\nAlternatively, after each iteration, check if the interval hasn't changed enough and throw.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAdd before the loop:\n\ndouble previousXA = xA;\ndouble previousXB = xB;\n\nThen, inside the loop, after updating xA and xB, compute the change:\n\ndouble currentXA = xA;\ndouble currentXB = xB;\ndouble delta = FastMath.abs(currentXB - currentXA) - FastMath.abs(previousXB - previousXA);\nif (delta < someTolerance) {\n    throw new ConvergenceException();\n}\n\nBut wait, this might not capture all cases. Maybe the interval is oscillating without converging.\n\nAlternatively, after each iteration, check if the interval width is smaller than a certain threshold, and if so, throw.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to track the number of iterations and throw after a maximum number, but the original function doesn't have such a counter.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code already has a way to track evaluations. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the code, each iteration calls computeObjectiveValue once. So, each loop iteration increases the evaluation count by one. So, perhaps the function has a maximum allowed evaluations.\n\nWait, the function is called doSolve(), which is part of a solver. It's possible that the solver has a maximum number of function evaluations allowed. So, perhaps in the computeObjectiveValue method, it's counted, and an exception is thrown when exceeded.\n\nBut in the original code, the loop doesn't check for this, leading to an infinite loop when the interval doesn't converge.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to add a check after each iteration to see if the interval has converged, and if not, throw an exception.\n\nSo, in the code, after the existing convergence check, I'll add another check to see if the interval hasn't changed enough.\n\nWait, the existing convergence check is:\n\nif (((xB - xA) <= xTol) || (FastMath.max(absYA, absYB) < getFunctionValueAccuracy())) { ... }\n\nSo, if either the interval is small enough or the function values are below accuracy, it returns.\n\nBut in cases where neither condition is met, the loop continues. So, to prevent infinite looping, I need to add another condition that, after a certain point, if the interval isn't changing, throw.\n\nSo, perhaps after the existing convergence check, I can add:\n\n// Check for convergence stagnation\ndouble currentInterval = xB - xA;\nif (currentInterval <= xTol) {\n    // Interval is already within tolerance, but function values aren't accurate enough\n    // Maybe throw an exception here\n    throw new ConvergenceException(\"Bracketing interval converged but function value not accurate enough.\");\n}\n\nWait, but that might not cover all cases. Alternatively, track the previous interval and see if it's changing.\n\nSo, let me add variables to track the previous interval:\n\ndouble previousInterval = xB - xA;\n\nThen, inside the loop, after updating xA and xB, compute currentInterval = xB - xA;\n\ndouble deltaInterval = FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval);\nif (deltaInterval < someTolerance) {\n    // The interval isn't changing, so we're stuck\n    throw new ConvergenceException(\"Interval not converging.\");\n}\n\npreviousInterval = currentInterval;\n\nBut where to place this? After the existing convergence check.\n\nWait, perhaps after the existing convergence check, add:\n\n// Check if the interval is not changing significantly\nfinal double intervalTolerance = 1e-12; // Or get from some method\ndouble currentInterval = xB - xA;\nif (FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval) < intervalTolerance) {\n    throw new ConvergenceException(\"Bracketing interval has not changed significantly.\");\n}\npreviousInterval = currentInterval;\n\nBut I need to initialize previousInterval before the loop. Let me add:\n\ndouble previousInterval = xB - xA;\n\nThen, inside the loop, after the existing convergence check, compute currentInterval, check delta, and update previousInterval.\n\nWait, but in the loop, xA and xB are updated each iteration. So, the initial previousInterval is set before the loop starts, and then inside the loop, after xA and xB are updated, we check.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Before the loop, set previousInterval = xB - xA.\n\n2. Inside the loop:\n\n   a. Perform the existing convergence check.\n\n   b. Compute currentInterval = xB - xA.\n\n   c. Compute delta = |currentInterval - previousInterval|.\n\n   d. If delta < intervalTolerance, throw exception.\n\n   e. Update previousInterval to currentInterval.\n\nBut wait, the initial previousInterval is set before the loop, which is the initial xB - xA. Then, inside the loop, after the first iteration, xA and xB are updated, so currentInterval is the new interval.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\n// Before the loop\ndouble previousInterval = xB - xA;\n\nwhile (true) {\n\n    // Existing convergence check\n    if (condition) { ... }\n\n    // New convergence check\n    double currentInterval = xB - xA;\n    double delta = FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval);\n    if (delta < intervalTolerance) {\n        throw new ConvergenceException(\"Interval not converging.\");\n    }\n    previousInterval = currentInterval;\n\n    // Rest of the loop\n}\n\nBut wait, in the existing code, after the convergence check, the loop continues. So, adding this after the convergence check would ensure that if the interval isn't changing, it throws.\n\nBut what value should intervalTolerance be? Maybe it's a small value like 1e-12, or perhaps it's based on the absolute accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, use the same xTol as before. Because xTol is computed as getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * max(xA, xB). So, if the interval isn't changing by more than xTol, it's considered converged.\n\nWait, but in the existing convergence check, if (xB - xA) <= xTol, it returns. So, perhaps the new check should be if the change in interval is less than xTol, indicating no progress.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\ndouble xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\nif (delta < xTol) {\n    throw new ConvergenceException(...);\n}\n\nBut wait, xTol is already computed in the existing convergence check. So, perhaps we can compute it again here, or store it in a variable.\n\nAlternatively, compute xTol once before the loop and reuse it.\n\nWait, no, because xTol is based on xA and xB, which change each iteration. So, each iteration, xTol would be different.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to compute xTol again for the current xA and xB.\n\nSo, inside the loop, after the existing convergence check, compute xTol again, then compute currentInterval, delta, and check if delta < xTol.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because xTol is for the current xA and xB, and delta is the change from previous interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interval isn't shrinking, so the change is less than the tolerance.\n\nI think the key is to prevent the loop from continuing indefinitely when the interval isn't changing. So, adding this check will ensure that if the interval doesn't change by a certain amount, the solver stops.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nInside the loop, after the existing convergence check:\n\n// Compute current interval\ndouble currentInterval = xB - xA;\n\n// Compute tolerance based on current xA and xB\ndouble currentXTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n\n// Check if the interval hasn't changed enough\nif (FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval) <= currentXTol) {\n    throw new ConvergenceException(\"Bracketing interval has not converged.\");\n}\n\n// Update previous interval\npreviousInterval = currentInterval;\n\nWait, but initial previousInterval is set before the loop. So, the first time inside the loop, previousInterval is the initial interval, and currentInterval is after the first iteration.\n\nSo, this should catch when the interval stops changing.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this doesn't interfere with the normal convergence. For example, if the interval is supposed to converge normally, this check shouldn't trigger.\n\nI think this should work because once the interval is within xTol, the existing convergence check would have already returned. So, this new check is for when the interval isn't changing but is still larger than xTol.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAdd before the loop:\n\ndouble previousInterval = xB - xA;\n\nThen, inside the loop, after the existing convergence check:\n\n// Compute current interval\ndouble currentInterval = xB - xA;\n\n// Compute the change in interval\ndouble deltaInterval = FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval);\n\n// Compute the tolerance for this iteration\ndouble xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n\n// Check if the interval hasn't changed enough\nif (deltaInterval <= xTol) {\n    throw new ConvergenceException(\"Bracketing interval has not converged.\");\n}\n\n// Update previous interval for next iteration\npreviousInterval = currentInterval;\n\nWait, but deltaInterval is the absolute difference between current and previous interval. So, if it's less than or equal to xTol, which is the tolerance for convergence, then the interval isn't changing enough, so we throw.\n\nThis should prevent the infinite loop because if the interval isn't changing by more than xTol, it's stuck.\n\nSo, incorporating this into the code.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the exception type. The original code throws NoBracketingException and MathInternalError. So, perhaps create a new exception type, but since the user might not have that, maybe throw an existing one, like NoBracketingException, but with a different message.\n\nAlternatively, create a custom exception, but perhaps for this fix, we can throw a runtime exception with a message.\n\nBut in the original code, when the bracketing isn't found, it throws NoBracketingException. So, perhaps in this case, we can throw the same exception but with a message indicating that the interval didn't converge.\n\nSo, in the code, when the deltaInterval is too small, throw:\n\nthrow new NoBracketingException(xA, xB, yA, yB);\n\nBut wait, the constructor might not take all four parameters. Looking back, the original code throws new NoBracketingException(x[0], x[2], y[0], y[2]); So, the constructor expects min, max, minVal, maxVal.\n\nIn our case, xA is the lower bound, xB is the upper bound. So, we can throw:\n\nthrow new NoBracketingException(xA, xB, yA, yB);\n\nBut I need to make sure that the NoBracketingException constructor accepts these parameters.\n\nAssuming it does, then this should be fine.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the modified code will have:\n\n- Before the loop: previousInterval = xB - xA;\n\n- Inside the loop, after the existing convergence check:\n\n   double currentInterval = xB - xA;\n   double deltaInterval = FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval);\n   double xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n   if (deltaInterval <= xTol) {\n       throw new NoBracketingException(xA, xB, yA, yB);\n   }\n   previousInterval = currentInterval;\n\nWait, but in the original code, xA and xB are updated in each iteration. So, the initial previousInterval is set before the loop starts, which is the initial xB - xA.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe initial xA and xB are set before the loop. Then, previousInterval is set to xB - xA.\n\nThen, inside the loop, after the convergence check, currentInterval is xB - xA (which may have been updated in this iteration), delta is current - previous, and if delta is <= xTol, throw.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration, previousInterval is the initial interval, and currentInterval is after the first update. So, delta is the change after the first iteration.\n\nIf the interval doesn't change enough, it throws.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll implement this.\n\nAnother thing: the variable xTol is already computed in the existing convergence check. So, perhaps we can store it in a variable to avoid recomputing.\n\nLooking back, in the existing code, xTol is computed as:\n\nfinal double xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n\nSo, perhaps we can compute xTol once at the beginning of the loop and reuse it.\n\nSo, moving the xTol computation before the convergence check.\n\nWait, but in the existing code, xTol is computed inside the convergence check condition. So, perhaps it's better to compute it once per iteration.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\n// Compute xTol for this iteration\nfinal double xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n\n// Check convergence\nif (((xB - xA) <= xTol) || (FastMath.max(absYA, absYB) < getFunctionValueAccuracy())) {\n    // return as before\n}\n\n// Then, compute currentInterval and delta\n\nSo, in the new check, xTol is already computed.\n\nSo, the new code would be:\n\n// Compute xTol once per iteration\nfinal double xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() + getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n\n// Existing convergence check\nif (((xB - xA) <= xTol) || (FastMath.max(absYA, absYB) < getFunctionValueAccuracy())) {\n    // return...\n}\n\n// New convergence check\ndouble currentInterval = xB - xA;\ndouble deltaInterval = FastMath.abs(currentInterval - previousInterval);\nif (deltaInterval <= xTol) {\n    throw new NoBracketingException(xA, xB, yA, yB);\n}\npreviousInterval = currentInterval;\n\nThis way, xTol is computed once per iteration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the modified function will include these changes.\n\nI think this should fix the infinite loop issue by ensuring that if the interval doesn't change enough, the solver throws an exception.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the infinite loop issue in the solver, we added a convergence check to ensure the bracketing interval progresses.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this buggy function. The problem is that the solver gets stuck in an infinite loop when the function value at the guessed root isn't a perfect root and the bracketing interval doesn't converge. The root cause is the use of inverse polynomial interpolation, which might not handle these cases well. The suggestion is to switch to a different interpolation method, like linear interpolation, to make the solver more robust.\n\nLet me look at the original code. The function uses inverse polynomial interpolation to guess the next point. If the guess isn't within the bracketing interval, it tries again with a lower order. But if it keeps failing, it falls back to bisection. However, in some cases, this approach doesn't converge, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nSo, the plan is to replace the inverse polynomial interpolation with a simpler method, like linear interpolation. Linear interpolation between the current bracketing points might help the solver converge faster and avoid getting stuck.\n\nLooking at the code, the key part is where nextX is calculated using guessX with inverse polynomial interpolation. I'll need to modify this section.\n\nFirst, I'll remove the inverse polynomial interpolation and instead use linear interpolation between xA and xB to estimate the next point. But wait, maybe I should consider the function values yA and yB to make a better guess. Linear interpolation would estimate the root based on the line connecting (xA, yA) and (xB, yB).\n\nSo, the formula for linear interpolation is nextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA). But I need to handle the case where yA and yB have the same sign, but that shouldn't happen because the bracketing interval ensures a sign change.\n\nWait, in the code, xA and xB are the current bracketing points, and yA and yB are their function values. Since there's a sign change, yA and yB have opposite signs, so yB - yA won't be zero. So, using linear interpolation here should be safe.\n\nI'll replace the inverse polynomial interpolation part with this calculation. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Instead of using tmpX and calling guessX, compute nextX using linear interpolation between xA and xB based on yA and yB.\n2. Ensure that nextX is within the bracketing interval (xA, xB). If it's outside, clamp it to stay within the interval to prevent invalid guesses.\n3. Remove the loop that tries different orders of interpolation since linear interpolation is straightforward and doesn't require multiple attempts.\n4. If the linear interpolation fails to provide a valid nextX (which shouldn't happen here), fall back to bisection as before.\n\nWait, but in the original code, there's a do-while loop that tries to guess nextX by reducing the interpolation order if the initial guess is invalid. With linear interpolation, maybe we can simplify this.\n\nSo, in the modified code, the do-while loop can be removed. Instead, compute nextX once using linear interpolation. If it's NaN or outside the interval, then fall back to bisection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the do-while loop can be kept, but with a simpler approach. Let me think: the loop was intended to handle cases where the interpolation fails by reducing the number of points considered. But with linear interpolation, which only uses two points, this might not be necessary. So, perhaps the loop can be simplified or removed.\n\nWait, in the original code, the do-while loop is inside the search loop. It tries to guess nextX using inverse polynomial interpolation, starting with a subset of points. If it fails, it reduces the number of points and tries again. After a few attempts, if it still can't find a valid nextX, it falls back to bisection.\n\nIn the fixed version, since we're using linear interpolation, which only requires two points, maybe we can compute nextX directly without the loop. But perhaps keeping a simplified version of the loop could help in cases where the initial guess is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop isn't needed anymore because linear interpolation is more straightforward. Let me consider removing the loop and directly compute nextX.\n\nWait, but the original code has a do-while loop that runs until nextX is valid or until it can't find a better guess. If I switch to linear interpolation, maybe the loop can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop can be removed, and nextX is computed once. If it's valid, proceed; otherwise, fall back to bisection.\n\nHmm, perhaps the safest approach is to compute nextX using linear interpolation, check if it's within the bracketing interval, and if not, compute it as the midpoint (bisection). That way, we avoid the loop and potential infinite recursion.\n\nSo, let's outline the changes:\n\n- Remove the tmpX array and the guessX function call.\n- Compute nextX using linear interpolation between xA and xB.\n- Ensure nextX is strictly between xA and xB. If not, set it to the midpoint.\n- Remove the do-while loop and related logic, as it's no longer needed.\n\nWait, but the original code also handles cases where the interpolation might not be possible due to repeated y values, leading to NaN. With linear interpolation, this shouldn't happen because yA and yB have opposite signs, so their difference isn't zero.\n\nSo, the steps in the code would be:\n\n1. Compute nextX using linear interpolation.\n2. Check if nextX is within (xA, xB). If yes, use it.\n3. If not, compute nextX as (xA + xB) / 2 (bisection).\n\nAlternatively, clamp nextX to the interval [xA, xB] to ensure it's within bounds.\n\nLet me write the code for this:\n\nnextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\n\nif (nextX <= xA || nextX >= xB) {\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA); // bisection\n}\n\nBut wait, since yA and yB have opposite signs, the denominator (yB - yA) is non-zero, so nextX should be a valid point between xA and xB. So, perhaps the clamping isn't necessary, but adding it as a safeguard might prevent any unexpected issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just compute nextX as the linear interpolation and proceed without checking, since the bracketing ensures yA and yB have opposite signs.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe include a check to ensure nextX is within the interval. If it's outside, use bisection.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndouble nextX;\nif (yB != yA) { // which is always true since sign changed\n    nextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\n} else {\n    // This case shouldn't happen, but handle it just in case\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\n// Ensure nextX is within the bracketing interval\nif (nextX < xA || nextX > xB) {\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\nAlternatively, since yA and yB have opposite signs, the nextX computed via linear interpolation should always be between xA and xB. So, perhaps the clamping is unnecessary, but including it could make the code more robust.\n\nWait, let's test with an example. Suppose xA = 1, yA = -2; xB = 3, yB = 4.\n\nnextX = 1 - (-2)*(3-1)/(4 - (-2)) = 1 + 2*(2)/(6) = 1 + 4/6 = 1 + 2/3 \u2248 1.666..., which is between 1 and 3.\n\nAnother example: xA=2, yA=1; xB=4, yB=-1.\n\nnextX = 2 - 1*(4-2)/(-1 -1) = 2 - (2)/(-2) = 2 +1 =3, which is between 2 and4.\n\nSo, in these cases, nextX is within the interval. So perhaps clamping isn't needed.\n\nBut what if yA and yB are such that nextX is outside? Let me see.\n\nWait, yA and yB have opposite signs, so (yB - yA) is positive if yB is positive and yA is negative, or negative otherwise.\n\nWait, let's say yA is positive and yB is negative. So, yB - yA is negative.\n\nnextX = xA - yA*(xB - xA)/(yB - yA)\n\nSince yA is positive and denominator is negative, the term is negative. So nextX = xA + [negative value]. So if xA is 1, and the term is -2, nextX would be -1, which is less than xA.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So in this case, nextX would be less than xA, which is outside the bracketing interval.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. So, the formula might give a nextX outside the interval in some cases.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the formula. The correct formula for linear interpolation to find the root is:\n\nnextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA)\n\nBut when yA is positive and yB is negative, yB - yA is negative. So, let's plug in numbers.\n\nExample:\n\nxA = 1, yA = 2 (positive)\nxB = 3, yB = -4 (negative)\nSo, nextX = 1 - 2*(3-1)/(-4 -2) = 1 - 2*2/(-6) = 1 + 4/6 \u2248 1.666..., which is between 1 and 3.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nxA = 1, yA = -2 (negative)\nxB = 3, yB = 4 (positive)\nnextX = 1 - (-2)*(2)/(4 - (-2)) = 1 + 4/6 \u2248 1.666..., which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf yA is positive and yB is negative:\n\nnextX = xA - yA*(xB - xA)/(yB - yA)\n\nSince yB - yA is negative (because yB is negative and yA positive), the denominator is negative.\n\nSo, the term yA*(xB - xA) is positive (since yA is positive, xB > xA). So, the numerator is positive, denominator negative: the whole fraction is negative. So, subtracting a negative is adding.\n\nSo, nextX = xA + [positive value], which would be greater than xA. But since xB > xA, and the fraction is (xB - xA) * yA / (yB - yA), which is (positive) * (positive) / (negative) \u2192 negative. So, subtracting that negative is adding a positive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of absolute values.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, and nextX will always be between xA and xB. Because the linear interpolation between two points with opposite y values will cross zero between xA and xB.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula ensures that nextX is within the interval. Therefore, clamping isn't necessary.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps adding a condition to clamp nextX to the interval would prevent any unexpected behavior, especially in cases where due to rounding errors, nextX might be slightly outside.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\nif (nextX < xA || nextX > xB) {\n    nextX = (xA + xB) / 2;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after computing nextX, there's a check to see if it's strictly inside the bracketing interval. If not, it tries again with a lower order. But with linear interpolation, perhaps this isn't needed anymore.\n\nSo, perhaps the do-while loop can be removed, and nextX is computed once. If it's valid, proceed; else, fall back to bisection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the loop can be kept, but with a simpler approach. But considering that linear interpolation is straightforward, maybe the loop isn't necessary.\n\nWait, in the original code, the loop is used to handle cases where the interpolation might fail by reducing the number of points. But with linear interpolation, which only uses two points, this isn't applicable. So, the loop can be removed.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, the section where nextX is computed would be:\n\n// Compute nextX using linear interpolation\ndouble nextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\n\n// Ensure nextX is strictly inside the bracketing interval\nif (nextX <= xA || nextX >= xB) {\n    // Fall back to bisection\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\n// No need for the do-while loop anymore\n\nWait, but in the original code, after computing nextX, there's a check to see if it's strictly inside the interval. If not, it reduces the interpolation order. But with linear interpolation, perhaps we can directly compute nextX and handle any invalid cases by falling back to bisection.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n// Compute nextX using linear interpolation\ndouble nextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\n\n// Check if nextX is within the bracketing interval\nif (nextX <= xA || nextX >= xB) {\n    // If not, use bisection\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\n// Proceed to evaluate nextX\n\nThis should replace the original do-while loop and guessX call.\n\nNow, I need to update the code accordingly.\n\nLooking back at the original code, the do-while loop starts with:\n\ndo {\n    // guess a value for current target, using inverse polynomial interpolation\n    System.arraycopy(x, start, tmpX, start, end - start);\n    nextX = guessX(targetY, tmpX, y, start, end);\n    // ... checks and adjustments\n} while (Double.isNaN(nextX) && (end - start > 1));\n\nThen, if nextX is still NaN, it falls back to bisection.\n\nIn the fixed version, this entire block can be replaced with the linear interpolation approach.\n\nSo, the code after the targetY determination becomes:\n\n// Compute nextX using linear interpolation\ndouble nextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\n\n// Ensure nextX is strictly inside the bracketing interval\nif (nextX <= xA || nextX >= xB) {\n    // Fall back to bisection\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\n// Remove the do-while loop and related code\n\nWait, but in the original code, after computing nextX, there's a block that adjusts the arrays if nbPoints > 2 and end - start != nbPoints. That part can remain as is because it's about managing the points array.\n\nSo, the main change is in how nextX is computed.\n\nAnother thing to consider: in the original code, after computing nextX, it's inserted into the x and y arrays, and the bracketing interval is updated. That part remains the same.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the fixed function would have the following changes:\n\n1. Remove the tmpX array and the guessX function call.\n2. Replace the do-while loop with the linear interpolation calculation.\n3. Ensure nextX is within the bracketing interval, falling back to bisection if necessary.\n\nLet me write the modified code step by step.\n\nFirst, remove the tmpX array. So, the line:\n\nfinal double[] tmpX = new double[x.length];\n\ncan be removed.\n\nThen, in the search loop, after determining targetY, compute nextX as follows:\n\n// Compute nextX using linear interpolation\ndouble nextX = xA - yA * (xB - xA) / (yB - yA);\n\n// Ensure nextX is strictly inside the bracketing interval\nif (nextX <= xA || nextX >= xB) {\n    // Fall back to bisection\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\nThen, proceed to evaluate nextY as before.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the do-while loop, if nextX is NaN, it falls back to bisection. In the fixed code, we compute nextX directly, so the NaN case shouldn't happen. But to be safe, perhaps include a check:\n\nif (Double.isNaN(nextX)) {\n    nextX = xA + 0.5 * (xB - xA);\n}\n\nBut with linear interpolation, nextX should never be NaN because yA and yB have opposite signs, so yB - yA is non-zero.\n\nSo, perhaps it's sufficient to compute nextX as above.\n\nNow, let me think about the rest of the code. After computing nextX, the code evaluates nextY, checks for convergence, and updates the bracketing interval.\n\nI think that's all. So, the main change is in how nextX is computed.\n\nLet me summarize the changes:\n\n- Remove the tmpX array.\n- Replace the do-while loop with linear interpolation to compute nextX.\n- Ensure nextX is within the bracketing interval, else use bisection.\n\nNow, let me write the fixed code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```java\nprotected double doSolve() {\n\n    // prepare arrays with the first points\n    final double[] x = new double[maximalOrder + 1];\n    final double[] y = new double[maximalOrder + 1];\n    x[0] = getMin();\n    x[1] = getStartValue();\n    x[2] = getMax();\n    verifySequence(x[0], x[1], x[2]);\n\n    // evaluate initial guess\n    y[1] = computeObjectiveValue(x[1]);\n    if (Precision.equals(y[1], 0.0, 1)) {\n        // return the initial guess if it is a perfect root.\n        return x[1];\n    }\n\n    // evaluate first  endpoint\n    y[0] = computeObjectiveValue(x[0]);\n    if (Precision.equals(y[0], 0.0, 1)) {\n        // return the first endpoint if it is a perfect root.\n        return x[0];\n    }\n\n    int nbPoints;\n    int signChangeIndex;\n    if (y[0] * y[1] < 0) {\n\n        // reduce interval if it brackets the root\n        nbPoints        = 2;\n        signChangeIndex = 1;\n\n    } else {\n\n        // evaluate second endpoint\n        y[2] = computeObjectiveValue(x[2]);\n        if (Precision.equals(y[2], 0.0, 1)) {\n            // return the second endpoint if it is a perfect root.\n            return x[2];\n        }\n\n        if (y[1] * y[2] < 0) {\n            // use all computed point as a start sampling array for solving\n            nbPoints        = 3;\n            signChangeIndex = 2;\n        } else {\n            throw new NoBracketingException(x[0], x[2], y[0], y[2]);\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // current tightest bracketing of the root\n    double xA    = x[signChangeIndex - 1];\n    double yA    = y[signChangeIndex - 1];\n    double absYA = FastMath.abs(yA);\n    int agingA   = 0;\n    double xB    = x[signChangeIndex];\n    double yB    = y[signChangeIndex];\n    double absYB = FastMath.abs(yB);\n    int agingB   = 0;\n\n    // search loop\n    while (true) {\n\n        // check convergence of bracketing interval\n        final double xTol = getAbsoluteAccuracy() +\n                            getRelativeAccuracy() * FastMath.max(FastMath.abs(xA), FastMath.abs(xB));\n        if (((xB - xA) <= xTol) || (FastMath.max(absYA, absYB) < getFunctionValueAccuracy())) {\n            switch (allowed) {\n            case ANY_SIDE :\n                return absYA < absYB ?
