      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue is not directly related to the `isSimpleNumber` function, but rather to how the `CodePrinter` handles numeric keys in objects. The `isSimpleNumber` function is used to determine whether a key should be printed as a number or a string. However, the function is not the root cause of the issue. The root cause is likely in the `CodePrinter` class, which is not shown in the provided code. The `CodePrinter` class is printing numeric keys as strings, resulting in the unexpected output.\nSuggestion: Modify `isSimpleNumber` to always return true for numeric keys\nThis solution involves modifying the `isSimpleNumber` function to always return true for numeric keys, so that they are printed as numbers. This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:\n```java\nstatic boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {\n  if (s.matches(\"\\\\d+\")) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  int len = s.length();\n  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {\n    char c = s.charAt(index);\n    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return len > 0 && s.charAt(0) != '0';\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple but might have unintended consequences. It would fix the issue but might cause issues with non-numeric keys that are printed as numbers.\n// Buggy Function\nstatic boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {\n  int len = s.length();\n  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {\n    char c = s.charAt(index);\n    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return len > 0 && s.charAt(0) != '0';\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This can be achieved by using a regular expression to match valid property names:\n```java\nstatic boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {\n  if (s.matches(\"[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_$0-9]*\")) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  int len = s.length();\n  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {\n    char c = s.charAt(index);\n    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return len > 0 && s.charAt(0) != '0';\n}\n```\nThis solution is more robust but might be more complex to implement.
