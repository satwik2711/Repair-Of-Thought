      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the '\\u00b1' characters. The function is using the `char` data type to store the characters from the buffer, but the '\\u00b1' character is not a standard ASCII character and is being interpreted as a different character. Specifically, the '\\u00b1' character is being interpreted as a '\\uffb1' character, which is a Unicode character that is not equivalent to the '\\u00b1' character.\nSuggestion: Use Unicode Character Handling\nOne potential fix is to use Unicode character handling to correctly interpret the '\\u00b1' characters. We can use the `Character` class to get the Unicode code point of the character and then use the `String` class to create a string from the code point. Here is an example of how we can modify the function to use Unicode character handling:\n\n```java\nStringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(length);\nint end = offset + length;\n\nfor (int i = offset; i < end; ++i) {\n    if (buffer[i] == 0) {\n        break;\n    }\n    int codePoint = Character.codePointAt(buffer, i);\n    result.append(Character.toChars(codePoint));\n}\n\nreturn result.toString();\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static String parseName(byte[] buffer, final int offset, final int length) {\n    StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(length);\n    int          end = offset + length;\n\n    for (int i = offset; i < end; ++i) {\n        if (buffer[i] == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n        result.append((char) buffer[i]);\n    }\n\n    return result.toString();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
