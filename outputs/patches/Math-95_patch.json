      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `getInitialDomain` function is returning an invalid value when the denominator degrees of freedom is 2.0. This is because the function is using the formula `d / (d - 2.0)`, which results in a division by zero when `d` is 2.0. This causes the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.\nSuggestion: Handle Division by Zero\nOne possible fix is to add a special case to handle the division by zero when the denominator degrees of freedom is 2.0. We can return a default value or throw an exception in this case. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    if (d == 2.0) {\n        // handle division by zero\n        ret = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;\n    } else {\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n        // use mean\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    return ret;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the function is using the formula `d / (d - 2.0)`, which results in a division by zero when `d` is 2.0. This causes the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Formula\nAnother possible fix is to use a different formula that does not involve division by zero. For example, we could use the formula `d / (d - 1.0)` when `d` is close to 2.0. However, this may affect the accuracy of the calculation. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    if (Math.abs(d - 2.0) < 1e-6) {\n        // use a different formula when d is close to 2.0\n        ret = d / (d - 1.0);\n    } else {\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n        // use mean\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    return ret;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This causes the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.\nSuggestion: Add a Tolerance\nWe could also add a tolerance to the calculation to avoid division by zero. For example, we could use the formula `d / (d - 2.0 + tolerance)` where `tolerance` is a small positive value. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    double tolerance = 1e-6;\n    ret = d / (d - 2.0 + tolerance);\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n        // use mean\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    return ret;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
