      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the getLine() function. The problem is that when the line number is out of range or the line doesn't exist, it returns null instead of throwing an exception. This is causing the test to fail because it expects a RuntimeException.\n\nLet me look at the original function. So, the function starts by trying to get the code into the 'js' variable. If there's an IOException, it returns null. Then, it initializes pos and startLine. It checks if the lineNumber is greater than or equal to lastLine and sets pos and startLine accordingly.\n\nThen, there's a loop that runs from startLine to lineNumber. It looks for the next newline. If nextpos is -1, it returns null. So, if the line doesn't exist, it returns null. But according to the test, it should throw an exception instead.\n\nAfter the loop, it updates lastOffset and lastLine. Then, it checks if there's a newline after pos. If not, it returns null. Otherwise, it returns the substring.\n\nSo, the main issue is that in cases where the line doesn't exist or is out of range, the function returns null. Instead, it should throw a RuntimeException with a message.\n\nI need to modify the function to throw exceptions in those cases. Let's think about where to add these checks.\n\nFirst, after the loop, when trying to find the next newline. If it can't find it, instead of returning null, throw an exception. Also, in the loop, if nextpos is -1, which would mean the end of the string is reached before the desired line, that's another case to throw an exception.\n\nWait, let's see. The loop runs from startLine to lineNumber, which is exclusive. So, if n starts at startLine and goes up to lineNumber-1. For each iteration, it finds the next newline. If it can't find it, returns null. So, if the line is beyond the available lines, it returns null. Instead, it should throw.\n\nSo, in the loop, when nextpos is -1, that means there's no more lines. So, if n is less than lineNumber, but we can't find the next line, that means the line doesn't exist. So, in that case, we should throw an exception.\n\nSimilarly, after the loop, when checking for the next newline, if it's not found, that would mean that the current line is the last one. So, if the line number is beyond the total lines, we should throw.\n\nWait, let me think about the flow.\n\nSuppose the code has 5 lines. If someone calls getLine(6), the loop would run from startLine (say 1) up to 5. Then, after the loop, pos is set to the start of line 6, but since there is no line 6, when it tries to find the next newline, it returns -1, so the function returns null. But we need to throw an exception here.\n\nSo, in the part after the loop, when it checks if the next newline is -1, that's when the line is the last one. But if the line number is beyond the total lines, that's an error.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of lines first, and then check if the lineNumber is within that range. But that might be inefficient, especially if the code is large, because it would require counting all lines each time.\n\nAlternatively, we can modify the existing logic to throw exceptions when it would have returned null.\n\nSo, let's go step by step.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nfor (int n = startLine; n < lineNumber; n++) {\n    int nextpos = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\n    if (nextpos == -1) {\n        // This means we can't find the next line, so the line doesn't exist.\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Line \" + lineNumber + \" does not exist.\");\n    }\n    pos = nextpos + 1;\n}\n\nWait, but if the loop is trying to get to the start of the desired line, and if during the loop it can't find a newline, that means the desired line doesn't exist. So, in that case, we should throw.\n\nSimilarly, after the loop, when checking for the next newline:\n\nif (js.indexOf('\\n', pos) == -1) {\n    // This could mean two cases: either we're at the end of the file, or the line is the last one.\n    // But if the line is the last one, it's okay, but if the line number is beyond, it's an error.\n    // Wait, no. Because after the loop, we're at the start of the desired line. So, if there's no next newline, it just means the line is the last one. So, we should return the substring from pos to the end.\n\n    // But wait, in the original code, it returns null in this case. But according to the problem, we should throw an exception when the line doesn't exist. So, perhaps the original code is incorrect in returning null here.\n\n    // So, perhaps the correct approach is to check whether the lineNumber is valid before processing.\n\n    // Alternatively, perhaps the function should throw an exception if the line number is out of bounds.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to first determine the total number of lines, and then check if the lineNumber is within 1 to totalLines. If not, throw an exception.\n\nBut calculating the total lines each time might be expensive, especially for large js strings. But perhaps it's necessary for correctness.\n\nAlternatively, we can proceed as before, but when any step indicates that the line is not found, throw an exception.\n\nSo, in the loop, if nextpos is -1, throw.\n\nAfter the loop, when trying to get the substring, if the next newline is not found, that's okay because it's the last line. So, in that case, we can return the substring from pos to the end.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after the loop, it checks if the next newline is -1, and returns null. That's incorrect because it's possible that the line exists but is the last line. So, in that case, it should return the substring, not null.\n\nSo, perhaps the original code has a bug where it returns null for the last line. So, that's another issue to fix.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the code is \"line1\\nline2\\nline3\". So, lines 1,2,3.\n\nIf I call getLine(3), the loop runs from startLine=1 to 2 (since lineNumber is 3, loop runs for n=1 and 2). After the loop, pos is at the start of line3.\n\nThen, it checks if there's a newline after pos. Since line3 is the last line, there is no newline, so it returns null. But that's incorrect because line3 does exist. So, the function should return \"line3\", not null.\n\nSo, that's another bug in the original function. It incorrectly returns null for the last line.\n\nSo, to fix that, after the loop, if there's no next newline, we should return the substring from pos to the end of the string, not return null.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, after the loop, we should check if the next newline exists. If it does, return the substring up to that newline. If not, return the substring from pos to the end.\n\nSo, that's another change needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n\n1. In the loop, when nextpos is -1, throw an exception because the line doesn't exist.\n\n2. After the loop, when checking for the next newline, if it's -1, return the substring from pos to the end of js.\n\n3. Also, in the case where the js string is empty or the line is 0 or negative, perhaps we should handle that as well. But according to the problem statement, the issue is when the line is out of range or doesn't exist, so perhaps we can assume that lineNumber is at least 1.\n\nSo, let's outline the changes.\n\nFirst, in the loop:\n\nfor (int n = startLine; n < lineNumber; n++) {\n    int nextpos = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\n    if (nextpos == -1) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Line \" + lineNumber + \" does not exist.\");\n    }\n    pos = nextpos + 1;\n}\n\nWait, but if the loop is trying to reach the start of lineNumber, and during the loop, it can't find a newline, that means that the desired line doesn't exist. So, throwing an exception here is correct.\n\nThen, after the loop, check for the next newline:\n\nint nextNewline = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\nif (nextNewline == -1) {\n    // No next newline, so return from pos to end\n    String line = js.substring(pos);\n    return line;\n} else {\n    String line = js.substring(pos, nextNewline);\n    return line;\n}\n\nSo, that fixes the issue where the last line was returning null.\n\nAdditionally, we should handle the case where the lineNumber is less than 1. Because line numbers are typically 1-based. So, if someone passes 0 or a negative number, we should throw an exception.\n\nSo, at the beginning of the function, add:\n\nif (lineNumber < 1) {\n    throw new RuntimeException(\"Line number must be positive.\");\n}\n\nWait, but what if the function is called with lineNumber=0? It's invalid, so we should throw.\n\nSo, adding that check.\n\nPutting it all together, the fixed function would:\n\n- Check if lineNumber is less than 1, throw.\n\n- Proceed to get the code.\n\n- Then, in the loop, if any nextpos is -1, throw.\n\n- After the loop, check for next newline, and return accordingly.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the lineNumber is 1? Let's see.\n\nIf the js string is empty, then in the loop, nextpos would be -1, so it would throw.\n\nIf the js string has one line with no newline, then after the loop, nextNewline is -1, so it returns the substring.\n\nSo, that should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the code cannot be retrieved, i.e., the getCode() throws an IOException. The original function returns null. But according to the problem statement, the test expects a RuntimeException. So, perhaps in that case, we should also throw an exception instead of returning null.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the function returns null in cases where the line is out of range, but the test expects a RuntimeException. So, perhaps the IOException case should also be handled by throwing an exception.\n\nBut the original function returns null on IOException. So, perhaps that's another bug. Because if getCode() fails, the function returns null, but perhaps it should throw an exception.\n\nBut the problem statement's root cause is about line numbers, not about the IOException. So, perhaps the fix should only address the line number issue. However, to make the function more robust, perhaps it's better to throw an exception in case of IOException as well.\n\nBut the problem statement's suggestion is to throw an exception for invalid line numbers. So, perhaps the IOException case is beyond the current fix scope. But perhaps the test expects that any error, including IOException, results in a RuntimeException.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not return null in any case, but throw exceptions for all errors.\n\nSo, perhaps in the catch block, instead of returning null, we should throw a RuntimeException.\n\nSo, modifying the catch block:\n\ncatch (IOException e) {\n    throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to retrieve code.\", e);\n}\n\nBut the problem statement's main issue is the line number handling, so perhaps that's an additional improvement but not part of the required fix.\n\nBut since the test expects a RuntimeException, perhaps the function should not return null in any case.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to throw exceptions in all error cases.\n\nSo, to sum up, the changes are:\n\n1. At the beginning, check if lineNumber < 1, throw.\n\n2. In the loop, if nextpos == -1, throw.\n\n3. After the loop, if nextNewline == -1, return the substring from pos to end.\n\n4. In the catch block, throw an exception instead of returning null.\n\nSo, let's implement these changes.\n\nWait, but the original function returns null in two cases: when getCode() throws an IOException, and when the line doesn't exist or is out of range.\n\nSo, to fully address the issue, all error cases should result in exceptions.\n\nSo, the fixed function would:\n\n- Throw if lineNumber is invalid.\n\n- Throw if getCode() fails.\n\n- Throw if during the loop, a line is not found.\n\n- Return the correct line otherwise.\n\nSo, let's structure the code accordingly.\n\nNow, let's write the fixed code.\n\nFirst, add the check for lineNumber < 1.\n\nThen, in the try block, if getCode() throws, catch and throw a RuntimeException.\n\nIn the loop, if nextpos is -1, throw.\n\nAfter the loop, handle the next newline correctly.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\npublic String getLine(int lineNumber) {\n    if (lineNumber < 1) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Line number must be positive.\");\n    }\n\n    String js = \"\";\n    try {\n        js = getCode();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to retrieve code.\", e);\n    }\n\n    int pos = 0;\n    int startLine = 1;\n\n    if (lineNumber >= lastLine) {\n        pos = lastOffset;\n        startLine = lastLine;\n    }\n\n    for (int n = startLine; n < lineNumber; n++) {\n        int nextpos = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\n        if (nextpos == -1) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Line \" + lineNumber + \" does not exist.\");\n        }\n        pos = nextpos + 1;\n    }\n\n    lastOffset = pos;\n    lastLine = lineNumber;\n\n    int nextNewline = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\n    if (nextNewline == -1) {\n        return js.substring(pos);\n    } else {\n        return js.substring(pos, nextNewline);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but what about the case where the lineNumber is 1, and the js string is empty? Then, in the loop, n starts at 1, and the loop doesn't run because n < 1 is false. So, it proceeds to the next part.\n\nThen, nextNewline is js.indexOf('\\n', 0), which is -1. So, it returns js.substring(0), which is an empty string. But that's incorrect because line 1 doesn't exist.\n\nSo, in this case, the function would return an empty string instead of throwing an exception.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because if the js string is empty, line 1 doesn't exist, so getLine(1) should throw.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial check for lineNumber >=1 is not sufficient. We also need to ensure that the line actually exists.\n\nSo, perhaps after the loop, we need to check whether pos is beyond the length of js, or whether the line actually exists.\n\nWait, perhaps the loop correctly finds the starting position, but if the line doesn't exist, the loop would have thrown an exception.\n\nWait, let's see: if js is empty, then in the loop, for lineNumber=1, the loop runs from n=1 to n<1, which doesn't run. So, the loop doesn't execute. Then, after the loop, pos is 0, and nextNewline is -1. So, it returns js.substring(0), which is empty.\n\nBut that's incorrect because line 1 doesn't exist.\n\nSo, the function needs to check whether the line actually exists.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function should first determine the total number of lines, and then check if the lineNumber is within that range.\n\nBut that could be inefficient for large js strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the loop, we can check whether the current pos is beyond the end of the string. If so, throw an exception.\n\nWait, but in the case where the js string is empty, pos is 0, which is not beyond the end, but there are no lines.\n\nSo, perhaps after the loop, we need to verify that the current pos is valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should, after the loop, check if the current pos is beyond the string length. If so, throw.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should, after processing, check if the line is empty and the line number is beyond the available lines.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: after the loop, check if the current pos is beyond the string length. If so, throw.\n\nSo, after setting lastOffset and lastLine, check:\n\nif (pos >= js.length()) {\n    throw new RuntimeException(\"Line \" + lineNumber + \" does not exist.\");\n}\n\nBut wait, in the case where the line is the last one and has content, pos would be within the string.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to check if the line is empty. But that's not sufficient because a line could be empty but still exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should count the total lines and check if lineNumber is within that count.\n\nBut that would require processing the entire string each time, which could be slow for large strings.\n\nBut perhaps for correctness, it's necessary.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should first count the total number of lines.\n\nLet me think about how to do that.\n\nWe can split the js string into lines and count them.\n\nBut splitting on '\\n' may not be accurate because the string could end without a newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of newlines and add 1.\n\nBut that's not entirely accurate because consecutive newlines would create empty lines.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of line counting, each newline denotes a new line, and the total lines are the number of newlines +1, unless the string ends with a newline, in which case it's the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nint totalLines = js.split(\"\\n\", -1).length;\n\nBut in Java, the split method with a limit of -1 will include trailing empty strings.\n\nSo, for example, \"a\\nb\\n\" would split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"\"], so length 3.\n\nBut that's not correct because the third line is empty.\n\nBut in terms of line numbers, the empty string after the last newline is considered a line.\n\nSo, perhaps the total lines are indeed the number of elements in the split array.\n\nBut this approach could be inefficient for large strings because it creates an array of all lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of newlines:\n\nint totalLines = 0;\nint pos = 0;\nwhile (pos < js.length()) {\n    if (js.charAt(pos) == '\\n') {\n        totalLines++;\n    }\n    pos++;\n}\n// After loop, if the string is not empty, add 1.\nif (js.length() > 0) {\n    totalLines++;\n}\n\nWait, no. Because each newline marks the end of a line. So, the number of lines is the number of newlines +1, but only if the string is not empty. If the string is empty, it's 0 lines.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nCase 1: js = \"\" \u2192 0 lines.\n\nCase 2: js = \"a\" \u2192 1 line.\n\nCase 3: js = \"a\\nb\" \u2192 2 lines.\n\nCase 4: js = \"a\\nb\\n\" \u2192 3 lines (including the empty third line).\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nif js is empty \u2192 0 lines.\n\nelse \u2192 number of newlines +1.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nint totalLines = 0;\nif (!js.isEmpty()) {\n    totalLines = js.replaceAll(\"\\n$\", \"\").split(\"\\n\").length;\n}\n\nWait, no, because if the string ends with a newline, the split would include an empty string, which we don't want.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of newlines and add 1, but subtract 1 if the string ends with a newline.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to process the string and count lines as we go.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming for large strings.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of this function, it's necessary to ensure correctness.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should first count the total lines, and then check if the lineNumber is within 1 to totalLines. If not, throw an exception.\n\nSo, integrating that into the function:\n\npublic String getLine(int lineNumber) {\n    if (lineNumber < 1) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Line number must be positive.\");\n    }\n\n    String js = \"\";\n    try {\n        js = getCode();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Failed to retrieve code.\", e);\n    }\n\n    // Count total lines\n    int totalLines = 0;\n    if (!js.isEmpty()) {\n        totalLines = js.replaceAll(\"\\n$\", \"\").split(\"\\n\").length;\n    }\n\n    if (lineNumber > totalLines) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Line \" + lineNumber + \" does not exist.\");\n    }\n\n    int pos = 0;\n    int startLine = 1;\n\n    if (lineNumber >= lastLine) {\n        pos = lastOffset;\n        startLine = lastLine;\n    }\n\n    for (int n = startLine; n < lineNumber; n++) {\n        int nextpos = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\n        if (nextpos == -1) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Line \" + lineNumber + \" does not exist.\");\n        }\n        pos = nextpos + 1;\n    }\n\n    lastOffset = pos;\n    lastLine = lineNumber;\n\n    int nextNewline = js.indexOf('\\n', pos);\n    if (nextNewline == -1) {\n        return js.substring(pos);\n    } else {\n        return js.substring(pos, nextNewline);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this approach may not be efficient for large js strings because it processes the entire string to count lines each time getLine is called.\n\nBut according to the original note, the function is optimized for few warnings, so perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the original function's approach is better in terms of performance, but it has the bug of returning null instead of throwing.\n\nSo, perhaps the better approach is to keep the original logic but add the necessary checks to throw exceptions.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of counting lines, we can proceed as before, but in the loop, if nextpos is -1, throw. And after the loop, if the next newline is -1, return the substring, else return up to the newline.\n\nBut then, the case where the line is beyond the total lines would be caught in the loop.\n\nWait, let's think: if the line number is 5, but the total lines are 3.\n\nIn the loop, for n from 1 to 4:\n\nn=1: find next newline, pos moves to after first newline.\n\nn=2: find next newline, pos moves.\n\nn=3: find next newline, pos moves.\n\nn=4: try to find next newline. If there are only 3 lines, the next newline after line 3 would be -1. So, the loop would throw an exception.\n\nSo, that would correctly throw for line 5.\n\nBut what about the case where the js string is empty and lineNumber is 1?\n\nIn the loop, n starts at 1, and the loop runs while n < 1, which is false. So, the loop doesn't run. Then, after the loop, nextNewline is -1, so it returns js.substring(0), which is empty string. But that's incorrect because line 1 doesn't exist.\n\nSo, in this case, the function would return an empty string instead of throwing.\n\nSo, to handle this, perhaps after the loop, we need to check whether the current pos is beyond the string length or whether the line is empty.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the loop, we can check if the line is empty and whether it's the last line.\n\nWait, perhaps after the loop, if the line is empty and the lineNumber is 1, and the js string is empty, then it should throw.\n\nBut that",
