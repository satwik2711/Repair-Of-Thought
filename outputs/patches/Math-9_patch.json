      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the way the `revert` function calculates the new direction. The `zero.subtract(direction)` expression is subtracting the direction vector from the zero vector, which is not equivalent to negating the direction vector. This is because subtracting a vector from the zero vector does not change its magnitude, only its direction. However, the direction vector is being subtracted from the zero vector, resulting in a vector with the same magnitude but opposite direction, which is not the expected result.\nSuggestion: Negate the Direction Vector Directly\nThe simplest fix is to directly negate the direction vector using the `negate` method, like this: `final Line reverted = new Line(zero, direction.negate());`. This will correctly reverse the direction of the line.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Line revert() {\n    final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction));\n    return reverted;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

However, the direction vector is being subtracted from the zero vector, resulting in a vector with the same magnitude but opposite direction, which is not the expected result.\nSuggestion: Use Vector Subtraction Correctly\nAlternatively, we can use vector subtraction correctly by subtracting the direction vector from the zero vector and then negating the result, like this: `final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction).negate());`. However, this approach is less efficient and less readable than the first suggestion.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Line revert() {\n    final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction));\n    return reverted;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This approach makes it clear what the code is doing and can make it easier to understand and maintain.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Line revert() {\n    final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction));\n    return reverted;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
