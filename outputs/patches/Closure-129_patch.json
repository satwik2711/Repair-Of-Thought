Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is the incorrect annotation of the call as a 'free' call when it is actually a call on a newly created object. This is due to the fact that the function annotateCalls does not correctly handle the case where the call is on a newly created object, and incorrectly sets the FREE_CALL property to true.\nSuggestion: Check for New Expression\nOne possible fix is to add a check for the NEW expression in the annotateCalls function. If the call is on a newly created object, we should not set the FREE_CALL property to true. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the first child of the call node is a NEW expression. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate void annotateCalls(Node n) {\n  Preconditions.checkState(n.isCall());\n\n  // Keep track of of the \"this\" context of a call.  A call without an\n  // explicit \"this\" is a free call.\n  Node first = n.getFirstChild();\n\n  // ignore cast nodes.\n\n  if (!NodeUtil.isGet(first) && !(first instanceof New)) {\n    n.putBooleanProp(Node.FREE_CALL, true);\n  }\n\n  // Keep track of the context in which eval is called. It is important\n  // to distinguish between \"(0, eval)()\" and \"eval()\".\n  if (first.isName() &&\n      \"eval\".equals(first.getString())) {\n    first.putBooleanProp(Node.DIRECT_EVAL, true);\n  }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void annotateCalls(Node n) {\n  Preconditions.checkState(n.isCall());\n\n  // Keep track of of the \"this\" context of a call.  A call without an\n  // explicit \"this\" is a free call.\n  Node first = n.getFirstChild();\n\n  // ignore cast nodes.\n\n  if (!NodeUtil.isGet(first)) {\n    n.putBooleanProp(Node.FREE_CALL, true);\n  }\n\n  // Keep track of the context in which eval is called. It is important\n  // to distinguish between \"(0, eval)()\" and \"eval()\".\n  if (first.isName() &&\n      \"eval\".equals(first.getString())) {\n    first.putBooleanProp(Node.DIRECT_EVAL, true);\n  }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is due to the fact that the function annotateCalls does not correctly handle the case where the call is on a newly created object, and incorrectly sets the FREE_CALL property to true.\nSuggestion: Check for Get Property on New Object\nAnother possible fix is to add a check for the GETPROP expression on a newly created object in the annotateCalls function. If the call is on a property of a newly created object, we should not set the FREE_CALL property to true. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the first child of the call node is a NEW expression and the second child is a GETPROP expression.

This is due to the fact that the function annotateCalls does not correctly handle the case where the call is on a newly created object, and incorrectly sets the FREE_CALL property to true.\nSuggestion: Check for Call on New Object with Specific Property\nA third possible fix is to add a check for the specific case where the call is on a newly created object with a specific property in the annotateCalls function.
