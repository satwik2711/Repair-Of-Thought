      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the setPosition function is not correctly handling the order of the contexts in the union operation. The function is adding all the node pointers from the contexts to the node set, but it is not considering the order in which they are added. This is causing the function to return the wrong result when the order of the contexts is reversed.\nSuggestion: Sort the Contexts\nOne potential fix is to sort the contexts in the union operation before adding their node pointers to the node set. This would ensure that the node pointers are always added in the same order, regardless of the order of the contexts. However, this approach may have performance implications if the number of contexts is large. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\npublic boolean setPosition(int position) {\n    if (!prepared) {\n        prepared = true;\n        BasicNodeSet nodeSet = (BasicNodeSet) getNodeSet();\n        ArrayList pointers = new ArrayList();\n        // Sort the contexts\n        Arrays.sort(contexts);\n        for (int i = 0; i < contexts.length; i++) {\n            EvalContext ctx = (EvalContext) contexts[i];\n            while (ctx.nextSet()) {\n                while (ctx.nextNode()) {\n                    NodePointer ptr = ctx.getCurrentNodePointer();\n                    if (!pointers.contains(ptr)) {\n                        nodeSet.add(ptr);\n                        pointers.add(ptr);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return super.setPosition(position);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean setPosition(int position) {\n        if (!prepared) {\n            prepared = true;\n            BasicNodeSet nodeSet = (BasicNodeSet) getNodeSet();\n            ArrayList pointers = new ArrayList();\n            for (int i = 0; i < contexts.length; i++) {\n                EvalContext ctx = (EvalContext) contexts[i];\n                while (ctx.nextSet()) {\n                    while (ctx.nextNode()) {\n                        NodePointer ptr = ctx.getCurrentNodePointer();\n                        if (!pointers.contains(ptr)) {\n                            nodeSet.add(ptr);\n                            pointers.add(ptr);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return super.setPosition(position);\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is causing the function to return the wrong result when the order of the contexts is reversed.\nSuggestion: Use a Map to Store Node Pointers\nAnother potential fix is to use a map to store the node pointers, where the key is the node pointer and the value is the context that it belongs to. This would allow us to keep track of the order in which the node pointers were added, and ensure that they are always returned in the correct order.
