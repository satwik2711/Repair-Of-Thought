      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the error message in the `MissingOptionException` is not being constructed correctly. The `StringBuffer` is being used to append the required options, but it is not being prefixed with the expected message 'Missing required option: '.\nSuggestion: Prefix the Error Message\nPrefix the error message with 'Missing required option: ' before appending the required options. This can be done by adding the prefix to the `StringBuffer` before the loop. This solution is simple and easy to implement, and it correctly constructs the error message.\n\n```java\nprivate void checkRequiredOptions()\n    throws MissingOptionException\n{\n    // if there are required options that have not been\n    // processsed\n    if (requiredOptions.size() > 0)\n    {\n        Iterator iter = requiredOptions.iterator();\n        StringBuffer buff = new StringBuffer(\"Missing required option: \");\n\n        // loop through the required options\n        while (iter.hasNext())\n        {\n            buff.append(iter.next());\n        }\n\n        throw new MissingOptionException(buff.toString());\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void checkRequiredOptions()\n    throws MissingOptionException\n{\n    // if there are required options that have not been\n    // processsed\n    if (requiredOptions.size() > 0)\n    {\n        Iterator iter = requiredOptions.iterator();\n        StringBuffer buff = new StringBuffer();\n\n\n        // loop through the required options\n        while (iter.hasNext())\n        {\n            buff.append(iter.next());\n        }\n\n        throw new MissingOptionException(buff.toString());\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
