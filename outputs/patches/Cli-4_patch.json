      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the error message in the `MissingOptionException` is not being constructed correctly. The `StringBuffer` is being used to append the required options, but it is not being prefixed with the expected message 'Missing required option: '.\nSuggestion: Prefix the Error Message\nWe can prefix the error message with 'Missing required option: ' before throwing the `MissingOptionException`. This can be done by modifying the `checkRequiredOptions` function as follows:\n```java\nthrow new MissingOptionException(\"Missing required option: \" + buff.toString());\n```\nThis solution is simple and straightforward, and it correctly constructs the error message.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void checkRequiredOptions()\n    throws MissingOptionException\n{\n    // if there are required options that have not been\n    // processsed\n    if (requiredOptions.size() > 0)\n    {\n        Iterator iter = requiredOptions.iterator();\n        StringBuffer buff = new StringBuffer();\n\n\n        // loop through the required options\n        while (iter.hasNext())\n        {\n            buff.append(iter.next());\n        }\n\n        throw new MissingOptionException(buff.toString());\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
