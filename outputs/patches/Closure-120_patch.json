      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `isAssignedOnceInLifetime` does not correctly handle recursive function calls. When the function `f` calls itself recursively, the assignment to `u` is not considered to be in a loop, even though it is. This is because the function only checks if the assignment is in a loop by checking the parent blocks of the assignment, but it does not consider recursive function calls.\nSuggestion: Check for Recursive Function Calls\nWe can modify the function to check if the assignment is in a recursive function call by keeping track of the function calls and checking if the assignment is in a function that has already been called. This can be done by adding a set to keep track of the function calls and checking if the function is in the set before returning true.\n// Buggy Function\nboolean isAssignedOnceInLifetime() {\n  Reference ref = getOneAndOnlyAssignment();\n  if (ref == null) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Make sure this assignment is not in a loop.\n  for (BasicBlock block = ref.getBasicBlock();\n       block != null; block = block.getParent()) {\n    if (block.isFunction) {\n      break;\n    } else if (block.isLoop) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return true;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
