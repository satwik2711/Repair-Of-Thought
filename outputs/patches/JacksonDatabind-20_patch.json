      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `setAll` method in the `JsonNode` class is being confused with a setter method for the property 'all' in the JSON string. This is because the `ObjectMapper` is using a `LOWER_CASE` property naming strategy, which converts the property name 'all' to 'setAll', which is the same name as the `setAll` method in the `JsonNode` class.\nSuggestion: Rename the setAll Method\nOne possible fix is to rename the `setAll` method to something else, such as `addAllProperties`. This would avoid the conflict with the setter method for the property 'all'. The updated method would look like this:\n```java\npublic JsonNode addAllProperties(Map<String,? extends JsonNode> properties)\n{\n    for (Map.Entry<String,? extends JsonNode> en : properties.entrySet()) {\n        JsonNode n = en.getValue();\n        if (n == null) {\n            n = nullNode();\n        }\n        _children.put(en.getKey(), n);\n    }\n    return this;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic JsonNode setAll(Map<String,? extends JsonNode> properties)\n    {\n        for (Map.Entry<String,? extends JsonNode> en : properties.entrySet()) {\n            JsonNode n = en.getValue();\n            if (n == null) {\n                n = nullNode();\n            }\n            _children.put(en.getKey(), n);\n        }\n        return this;\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
