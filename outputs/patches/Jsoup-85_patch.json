      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the order of validation and trimming of the key. The `Validate.notEmpty(key)` check is performed after the key has been trimmed using `key.trim()`. This means that if the key is empty or contains only whitespace, the `trim()` method will return an empty string, and the `Validate.notEmpty(key)` check will pass, not throwing the expected `IllegalArgumentException`.\nSuggestion: Validate Before Trimming\nMove the `Validate.notEmpty(key)` check before the `key.trim()` call. This ensures that empty keys are correctly validated before trimming. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic Attribute(String key, String val, Attributes parent) {\n    Validate.notEmpty(key);\n    this.key = key.trim();\n    this.val = val;\n    this.parent = parent;\n}\n```\nThis approach is simple and effective, and ensures that empty keys are correctly validated before trimming.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Attribute(String key, String val, Attributes parent) {\n    Validate.notNull(key);\n    this.key = key.trim();\n    Validate.notEmpty(key); // trimming could potentially make empty, so validate here\n    this.val = val;\n    this.parent = parent;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This means that if the key is empty or contains only whitespace, the `trim()` method will return an empty string, and the `Validate.notEmpty(key)` check will pass, not throwing the expected `IllegalArgumentException`.\nSuggestion: Use a Single Validation Method\nReplace the `Validate.notNull(key)` and `Validate.notEmpty(key)` checks with a single `Validate.notBlank(key)` check. This method checks for both null and empty strings, and also trims the input string. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic Attribute(String key, String val, Attributes parent) {\n    Validate.notBlank(key);\n    this.key = key;\n    this.val = val;\n    this.parent = parent;\n}\n```\nThis approach provides a more concise and efficient way to validate the key.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Attribute(String key, String val, Attributes parent) {\n    Validate.notNull(key);\n    this.key = key.trim();\n    Validate.notEmpty(key); // trimming could potentially make empty, so validate here\n    this.val = val;\n    this.parent = parent;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This means that if the key is empty or contains only whitespace, the `trim()` method will return an empty string, and the `Validate.notEmpty(key)` check will pass, not throwing the expected `IllegalArgumentException`.\nSuggestion: Throw Exception on Empty Key\nAdd a custom check for empty keys after trimming, and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the key is empty. This approach provides more control over the error handling. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic Attribute(String key, String val, Attributes parent) {\n    Validate.notNull(key);\n    this.key = key.trim();\n    if (this.key.isEmpty()) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Key cannot be empty\");\n    }\n    this.val = val;\n    this.parent = parent;\n}\n```\nThis approach provides a more explicit and controlled way to handle empty keys.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Attribute(String key, String val, Attributes parent) {\n    Validate.notNull(key);\n    this.key = key.trim();\n    Validate.notEmpty(key); // trimming could potentially make empty, so validate here\n    this.val = val;\n    this.parent = parent;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
