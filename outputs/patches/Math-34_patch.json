      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of this bug is that the `iterator()` function is returning a direct iterator over the `chromosomes` list, which is modifiable. When `remove()` is called on this iterator, it's actually removing elements from the underlying list, instead of throwing an `UnsupportedOperationException`. This is because the `iterator()` function is not returning an unmodifiable iterator as intended.\nSuggestion: Return Unmodifiable Iterator\nWe can fix this bug by returning an unmodifiable iterator from the `iterator()` function. We can use the `Collections.unmodifiableIterator()` method to create an unmodifiable iterator from the modifiable iterator returned by the `chromosomes` list. This approach ensures that any attempt to remove elements from the iterator will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.\n\n```java\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    return Collections.unmodifiableIterator(chromosomes.iterator());\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    return chromosomes.iterator();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

When `remove()` is called on this iterator, it's actually removing elements from the underlying list, instead of throwing an `UnsupportedOperationException`. This is because the `iterator()` function is not returning an unmodifiable iterator as intended.\nSuggestion: Use Iterator with Custom Remove Behavior\nAnother way to fix this bug is to create a custom iterator that throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` when `remove()` is called. We can create a new iterator class that wraps the modifiable iterator returned by the `chromosomes` list and overrides the `remove()` method to throw the exception. This approach provides a more explicit way to handle the removal of elements from the iterator.\n\n```java\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    return new Iterator<Chromosome>() {\n        private Iterator<Chromosome> iterator = chromosomes.iterator();\n\n        @Override\n        public boolean hasNext() {\n            return iterator.hasNext();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Chromosome next() {\n            return iterator.next();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void remove() {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Iterator<Chromosome> iterator() {\n    return chromosomes.iterator();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

We can create a custom `ListIterator` that throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` when `remove()` is called. This approach is similar to Suggestion 2, but uses a `ListIterator` instead of an `Iterator`.
