Specifically, it is expecting a START_OBJECT token to contain the type information for the computers, but the actual JSON structure has a FIELD_NAME token (\"desktop\" or \"laptop\") instead. This is because the _deserialize function is designed to handle a specific JSON structure where the type information is contained in a START_OBJECT token, but the actual JSON structure has a different format.\nSuggestion: Modify _deserialize to Handle FIELD_NAME Tokens\nOne potential fix is to modify the _deserialize function to handle FIELD_NAME tokens instead of START_OBJECT tokens. This would involve checking the current token and handling it accordingly. For example, if the current token is a FIELD_NAME token, we could read the field name and then read the corresponding value.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this _deserialize function. The problem is that it's expecting a START_OBJECT token but the actual JSON has a FIELD_NAME like \"desktop\" or \"laptop\". So the function isn't handling the structure correctly.\n\nLet me look at the original code. It starts by checking if the current token is START_OBJECT. If not, it throws an exception. But in our case, the JSON might have a FIELD_NAME instead, so this check fails.\n\nThe root cause is that the function expects the type information to be in a START_OBJECT, but the JSON uses a FIELD_NAME for the type. So I need to adjust the function to read the FIELD_NAME as the type id.\n\nHmm, so the first step is to modify the initial token check. Instead of expecting START_OBJECT, maybe we should expect either START_OBJECT or FIELD_NAME. Or perhaps, we should read the next token to see if it's FIELD_NAME and extract the type id from there.\n\nWait, in the original code, after the initial START_OBJECT check, it tries to read a FIELD_NAME. But if the JSON structure is different, maybe the initial token isn't START_OBJECT at all. So perhaps the function should not assume that the current token is START_OBJECT.\n\nLet me think about the JSON structure. Suppose the JSON is like:\n{\n  \"desktop\": { ... }\n}\nIn this case, when the function is called, the parser is pointing at the FIELD_NAME \"desktop\". So the initial token is FIELD_NAME, not START_OBJECT. So the function's first check fails.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle cases where the type id is in a FIELD_NAME instead of being inside a START_OBJECT.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should first check if the current token is FIELD_NAME. If it is, then the type id is the field name, and the value is the object that follows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function should allow for both structures: one where the type is in a START_OBJECT with a field, and another where the type is the field name itself.\n\nWait, the original code is part of a custom deserializer, perhaps for polymorphic types. So the idea is that the JSON indicates the type, which could be in different formats.\n\nSo, the fix is to modify the function to correctly read the type id whether it's in a START_OBJECT or as a FIELD_NAME.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Remove the initial check for START_OBJECT. Instead, check the current token and handle accordingly.\n\n2. If the current token is START_OBJECT, then proceed as before, expecting a FIELD_NAME with the type id.\n\n3. If the current token is FIELD_NAME, then the type id is the field name, and the next token should be the START_OBJECT or value.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the START_OBJECT, it expects a FIELD_NAME for the type id. So in the new structure, perhaps the type id is the FIELD_NAME, and the value is the object.\n\nSo, the function should first check if the current token is FIELD_NAME. If yes, then the type id is the field's name, and then it should read the next token, which should be the value (could be an object or another token).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should be more flexible in how it reads the type id.\n\nSo, in the modified function:\n\n- Check the current token. If it's START_OBJECT, then read the next token as FIELD_NAME to get the type id.\n\n- If the current token is FIELD_NAME, then the type id is the current field name, and then proceed to read the next token for the value.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after getting the type id, it uses the deserializer to deserialize the value. So the main issue is correctly extracting the type id from the JSON structure.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should be restructured as follows:\n\n- Check if the current token is START_OBJECT. If yes, then read the next token as FIELD_NAME to get the type id.\n\n- Else, if the current token is FIELD_NAME, then the type id is the current field's name, and then the next token is the value.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the current token is FIELD_NAME, after getting the type id, we need to make sure that the next token is processed correctly.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nOriginal code:\n\n1. Check if current token is START_OBJECT. If not, throw exception.\n\n2. Then, read next token, expecting FIELD_NAME. If not, throw.\n\n3. Get type id from the field name.\n\n4. Find deserializer.\n\n5. Then, read next token.\n\n6. If _typeIdVisible and current token is START_OBJECT, then wrap the parser to include the type id.\n\n7. Deserialize the value.\n\n8. Check for END_OBJECT.\n\nSo, in the modified function, I need to handle the case where the current token is FIELD_NAME, indicating that the type id is the field name, and the value comes next.\n\nSo, perhaps the function can be adjusted as follows:\n\n- Remove the initial check for START_OBJECT.\n\n- Instead, check the current token. If it's START_OBJECT, proceed as before.\n\n- Else, if it's FIELD_NAME, then the type id is the field name, and then the next token is the value.\n\nWait, but in the case of FIELD_NAME, the value could be an object or another type. So, after getting the type id, the function should proceed to deserialize the value.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps in code:\n\nCheck current token:\n\nif (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n    // original logic: read next token as FIELD_NAME\n    if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n        throw ...\n    }\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...)\n    p.nextToken();\n} else if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    // type id is the field name\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...)\n    // move to next token, which should be the value\n    p.nextToken();\n} else {\n    throw ...\n}\n\nThen, after getting the type id and deserializer, proceed as before.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after getting the type id, it does some handling for _typeIdVisible. So perhaps that part can remain.\n\nWait, but in the case where the current token is FIELD_NAME, after getting the type id, the next token is the value, which could be an object or something else.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\nif (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n    // original logic\n    if (p.nextToken() != FIELD_NAME) { throw; }\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...);\n    p.nextToken();\n} else if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...);\n    p.nextToken(); // move to the value\n} else {\n    throw ...\n}\n\nThen, proceed with the rest.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after getting the type id, it checks if _typeIdVisible and the current token is START_OBJECT. So perhaps in the FIELD_NAME case, this part may not be needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _typeIdVisible part is for wrapping the type id into the JSON structure when deserializing. So in the case where the type id is in a FIELD_NAME, perhaps this wrapping isn't necessary.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should adjust that part as well.\n\nWait, let me think about the original code's purpose. It seems that the function is trying to deserialize a JSON structure that includes type information, which could be in different formats.\n\nIn the original code, if the type id is visible, it wraps the parser to include the type id as a field in the JSON object. But in the case where the type id is a FIELD_NAME, this wrapping might not be needed because the structure is different.\n\nSo, perhaps in the FIELD_NAME case, the _typeIdVisible handling is not applicable, so we can skip that part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not perform that wrapping when the type id is read from a FIELD_NAME.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the modified function would:\n\n1. Check the current token. If it's START_OBJECT, proceed as before.\n\n2. Else, if it's FIELD_NAME, read the type id and move to next token.\n\n3. Then, find the deserializer.\n\n4. Then, handle the _typeIdVisible case only if the current token is START_OBJECT after reading the type id.\n\nWait, but in the FIELD_NAME case, after reading the type id, the next token could be START_OBJECT or another token. So perhaps the _typeIdVisible handling should only be done if the next token is START_OBJECT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the _typeIdVisible part is not needed in the FIELD_NAME case because the structure is different.\n\nHmm, perhaps the _typeIdVisible part is intended to inject the type id into the JSON stream when the deserializer expects it. So, in the original structure, the type id is inside an object, so it's added as a field. But in the FIELD_NAME case, the type is already indicated by the field name, so perhaps the wrapping isn't needed.\n\nSo, in the modified function, after extracting the type id, whether from a FIELD_NAME inside a START_OBJECT or directly as a FIELD_NAME, we can proceed to deserialize.\n\nWait, perhaps the function should be restructured to handle both cases:\n\nCase 1: The JSON structure is { \"type\": \"desktop\", ... }.\n\nIn this case, the function expects a START_OBJECT, then a FIELD_NAME \"type\" with the type id.\n\nCase 2: The JSON structure is { \"desktop\": { ... } }.\n\nIn this case, the function is called when the parser is at the FIELD_NAME \"desktop\", and the value is the object.\n\nSo, the function needs to handle both cases.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Check the current token.\n\n- If it's START_OBJECT, then read the next token as FIELD_NAME to get the type id.\n\n- Else, if it's FIELD_NAME, then the type id is the field name, and the next token is the value.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n    // Case 1: type id is inside the object\n    if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n        throw ...\n    }\n    String typeId = p.getText();\n    // find deserializer\n    p.nextToken();\n} else if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    // Case 2: type id is the field name\n    String typeId = p.getText();\n    // find deserializer\n    p.nextToken();\n} else {\n    throw ...\n}\n\nThen, after getting the type id and moving the parser, proceed to deserialize.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after getting the type id, it checks if _typeIdVisible and the current token is START_OBJECT, and if so, wraps the parser to include the type id.\n\nIn Case 1, after extracting the type id, the current token is the value, which could be an object. So, if _typeIdVisible is true, it wraps the parser to add the type id as a field.\n\nIn Case 2, after extracting the type id, the current token is the value, which is the object. So, perhaps the wrapping is not needed because the type id is already in the field name.\n\nWait, but the wrapping is done to merge the type id into the JSON stream, perhaps for deserializers that expect the type id as a field.\n\nSo, in Case 1, the type id is inside the object as a field, so wrapping is needed to add it back if _typeIdVisible is true.\n\nIn Case 2, the type id is the field name, so the wrapping may not be necessary because the structure is different.\n\nHmm, perhaps the wrapping logic should only be applied in Case 1.\n\nSo, after extracting the type id, in Case 1, we proceed to check if _typeIdVisible and current token is START_OBJECT, and wrap if needed.\n\nIn Case 2, after extracting the type id, we don't need to wrap because the structure is different.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nif (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n    // Case 1\n    if (p.nextToken() != FIELD_NAME) { throw; }\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...);\n    p.nextToken();\n\n    if (_typeIdVisible && p.getCurrentToken() == START_OBJECT) {\n        // wrap the parser\n        TokenBuffer tb = new TokenBuffer(...);\n        tb.writeStartObject();\n        tb.writeFieldName(_typePropertyName);\n        tb.writeString(typeId);\n        p = JsonParserSequence.createFlattened(tb.asParser(p), p);\n        p.nextToken();\n    }\n} else if (p.getCurrentToken() == FIELD_NAME) {\n    // Case 2\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...);\n    p.nextToken(); // move to the value\n\n    // No wrapping needed here because the type is in the field name\n}\n\nThen, deserialize the value.\n\nWait, but in Case 2, after moving to the next token, the current token could be START_OBJECT or another token. So, the deserializer should handle that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the function would first check the current token and handle both cases.\n\nNow, let me think about the code structure.\n\nThe original code starts with:\n\nif (p.getCurrentToken() != START_OBJECT) {\n    throw ...\n}\n\nSo, that's the first thing. I need to remove that and instead check for both possibilities.\n\nSo, the modified code would:\n\n- Remove the initial START_OBJECT check.\n\n- Instead, check if the current token is START_OBJECT or FIELD_NAME.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nif (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n    // handle case 1\n    if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n        throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(...);\n    }\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...);\n    p.nextToken();\n\n    if (_typeIdVisible && p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n        // wrap the parser\n        TokenBuffer tb = new TokenBuffer(null, false);\n        tb.writeStartObject();\n        tb.writeFieldName(_typePropertyName);\n        tb.writeString(typeId);\n        p = JsonParserSequence.createFlattened(tb.asParser(p), p);\n        p.nextToken();\n    }\n} else if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    // handle case 2\n    typeId = p.getText();\n    deser = _findDeserializer(...);\n    p.nextToken(); // move to the value\n} else {\n    throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.START_OBJECT, \"Expected START_OBJECT or FIELD_NAME\");\n}\n\nThen, proceed to deserialize.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after handling the type id, it calls deser.deserialize(p, ctxt), and then checks for END_OBJECT.\n\nIn Case 1, after wrapping, the parser expects the value, which may be an object, so the END_OBJECT check is still needed.\n\nIn Case 2, after deserializing, the parser may not have an END_OBJECT because the structure is different. Wait, no: in Case 2, the JSON is like { \"desktop\": { ... } }, so after deserializing the value (the inner object), the parser would be at the END_OBJECT of the inner object. Then, the function expects to read the END_OBJECT, but in this case, the outer object's END_OBJECT hasn't been read yet.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about the structure.\n\nIn Case 2, the JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"desktop\": {\n    ... properties ...\n  }\n}\n\nWhen the function is called, the parser is pointing at the FIELD_NAME \"desktop\". So, the function reads \"desktop\" as the type id, then the next token is START_OBJECT. The function then deserializes the inner object, which should end with an END_OBJECT. After that, the function expects to read the END_OBJECT of the outer object.\n\nWait, no. Because in the function, after deserializing, it checks for END_OBJECT. So in Case 2, after deserializing the inner object, the parser is at END_OBJECT (of the inner object). Then, the function's nextToken() call would read the next token, which is the END_OBJECT of the outer object.\n\nWait, no. Let me think step by step.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- The parser is at FIELD_NAME \"desktop\".\n\n- The function reads the type id as \"desktop\", then moves to the next token, which is START_OBJECT.\n\n- Then, the function may or may not wrap (but in this case, it's Case 2, so no wrapping).\n\n- Then, it calls deser.deserialize(p, ctxt). The deserializer reads the START_OBJECT and its contents, and when it's done, the parser is at END_OBJECT (of the inner object).\n\n- Then, the function calls p.nextToken(), which would read the next token after the inner END_OBJECT, which is the END_OBJECT of the outer object.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after deserializing, it expects the next token to be END_OBJECT. So in Case 2, after deserializing, the next token is END_OBJECT (outer), so it should pass.\n\nWait, no. Let me simulate:\n\nAfter deserializing the inner object, the parser is at the inner END_OBJECT. Then, the function does p.nextToken(), which would read the next token, which is the outer END_OBJECT. So, the function's check would pass.\n\nBut wait, in the function, after deserializing, it does:\n\nif (p.nextToken() != END_OBJECT) {\n    throw ...\n}\n\nSo, in Case 2, after deserializing, the parser is at inner END_OBJECT. Then, p.nextToken() reads the outer END_OBJECT, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\n- The function is called when the parser is at the FIELD_NAME \"desktop\".\n\n- The function reads \"desktop\" as type id, then p.nextToken() moves to START_OBJECT (the inner object).\n\n- Then, deser.deserialize(p, ctxt) is called, which reads the inner object, and after that, the parser is at the inner END_OBJECT.\n\n- Then, the function does p.nextToken(), which moves to the next token after inner END_OBJECT, which is the outer END_OBJECT.\n\n- Then, the function checks if this token is END_OBJECT, which it is, so no exception.\n\nSo, the END_OBJECT check works in both cases.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after deserializing, it expects the next token to be END_OBJECT. So in Case 1, after deserializing, the parser is at the inner END_OBJECT, then nextToken() moves to the outer END_OBJECT.\n\nIn Case 2, same as above.\n\nSo, the END_OBJECT check remains valid.\n\nSo, the function should handle both cases correctly.\n\nNow, let me write the code accordingly.\n\nI'll structure it as:\n\n- Check if current token is START_OBJECT or FIELD_NAME.\n\n- For START_OBJECT, proceed as before, reading FIELD_NAME for type id.\n\n- For FIELD_NAME, read type id and proceed.\n\n- Then, handle the wrapping if needed (only in START_OBJECT case).\n\n- Then, deserialize.\n\n- Then, check for END_OBJECT.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nprivate final Object _deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException\n{\n    // 02-Aug-2013, tatu: May need to use native type ids\n    if (p.canReadTypeId()) {\n        Object typeId = p.getTypeId();\n        if (typeId != null) {\n            return _deserializeWithNativeTypeId(p, ctxt, typeId);\n        }\n    }\n\n    JsonToken currentToken = p.getCurrentToken();\n    String typeId = null;\n    JsonDeserializer<Object> deser = null;\n\n    if (currentToken == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n        // Case 1: type id is inside the object\n        if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n            throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.FIELD_NAME,\n                    \"need JSON String that contains type id (for subtype of \"+baseTypeName()+\")\");\n        }\n        typeId = p.getText();\n        deser = _findDeserializer(ctxt, typeId);\n        p.nextToken();\n\n        // Handle wrapping if needed\n        if (_typeIdVisible && p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n            TokenBuffer tb = new TokenBuffer(null, false);\n            tb.writeStartObject();\n            tb.writeFieldName(_typePropertyName);\n            tb.writeString(typeId);\n            p = JsonParserSequence.createFlattened(tb.asParser(p), p);\n            p.nextToken();\n        }\n    } else if (currentToken == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n        // Case 2: type id is the field name\n        typeId = p.getText();\n        deser = _findDeserializer(ctxt, typeId);\n        p.nextToken(); // move to the value\n    } else {\n        throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.START_OBJECT,\n                \"need JSON Object or FIELD_NAME to contain type information for class \"+baseTypeName());\n    }\n\n    // Now deserialize the value\n    Object value = deser.deserialize(p, ctxt);\n\n    // Check for closing END_OBJECT\n    if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n        throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.END_OBJECT,\n                \"expected closing END_OBJECT after type information and deserialized value\");\n    }\n\n    return value;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after handling the type id, it does:\n\nif (_typeIdVisible && p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n    // wrap the parser\n}\n\nSo, in the modified code, I moved that inside the START_OBJECT case.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after getting the type id and moving to the next token, it checks if the current token is START_OBJECT. So, in the modified code, after handling the START_OBJECT case, it does the same.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this should handle both cases.\n\nTesting this:\n\nCase 1: JSON is { \"type\": \"desktop\", ... }\n\n- currentToken is START_OBJECT.\n\n- read next token, which is FIELD_NAME \"type\".\n\n- get type id as \"desktop\".\n\n- find deserializer.\n\n- next token is the value, which could be START_OBJECT.\n\n- if _typeIdVisible, wrap the parser.\n\n- deserialize.\n\n- then, nextToken() should be END_OBJECT.\n\nCase 2: JSON is { \"desktop\": { ... } }\n\n- currentToken is FIELD_NAME \"desktop\".\n\n- get type id as \"desktop\".\n\n- find deserializer.\n\n- next token is START_OBJECT.\n\n- deserialize.\n\n- nextToken() after deserializing is END_OBJECT (of inner object), then nextToken() is END_OBJECT (of outer object), which passes the check.\n\nSo, the function should now correctly handle both JSON structures.\n\nI think this should fix the issue.\n</think>\n\nTo address the bug where the `_deserialize` function does not correctly handle the JSON structure of the computers list, we need to modify the function to accept both `START_OBJECT` and `FIELD_NAME` tokens for type information. This ensures compatibility with different JSON structures.\n\n```java\nprivate final Object _deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException\n{\n    // 02-Aug-2013, tatu: May need to use native type ids\n    if (p.canReadTypeId()) {\n        Object typeId = p.getTypeId();\n        if (typeId != null) {\n            return _deserializeWithNativeTypeId(p, ctxt, typeId);\n        }\n    }\n\n    JsonToken currentToken = p.getCurrentToken();\n    String typeId = null;\n    JsonDeserializer<Object> deser = null;\n\n    if (currentToken == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n        // Case 1: type id is inside the object\n        if (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n            throw ctxt.wrongTokenException(p, JsonToken.FIELD_NAME,\n                    \"need JSON String that contains type id (for subtype of \" + baseTypeName() + \")\");\n        }\n        typeId = p.getText();\n        deser = _findDeserializer(ctxt, typeId);\n        p.nextToken();\n\n        // Handle wrapping if needed\n        if (_typeIdVisible && p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.START_OBJECT) {\n            TokenBuffer tb = new TokenBuffer(null, false);\n            tb.writeStartObject();\n            tb.write",
