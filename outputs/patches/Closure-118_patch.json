      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The bug is caused by the fact that the `handleObjectLit` function is renaming properties in the OBJECTLIT node without checking if the property name is already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map. This causes the property name to be renamed to a unique name, which is not the expected behavior.\nSuggestion: Check for Existing Properties\nOne possible fix is to check if the property name is already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map before renaming it. This can be done by adding a simple check before the `scheduleRenaming` call. If the property is already present, the function can skip the renaming step. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (!propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n    if (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child, processProperty(t, prop, type, null))) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that properties that are already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map are not renamed, which should fix the bug.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void handleObjectLit(NodeTraversal t, Node n) {\n  for (Node child = n.getFirstChild();\n      child != null;\n      child = child.getNext()) {\n    // Maybe STRING, GET, SET\n\n    // We should never see a mix of numbers and strings.\n    String name = child.getString();\n    T type = typeSystem.getType(getScope(), n, name);\n\n    Property prop = getProperty(name);\n    if (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child,\n                               processProperty(t, prop, type, null))) {\n      // TODO(user): It doesn't look like the user can do much in this\n      // case right now.\n      if (propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n        compiler.report(JSError.make(\n            t.getSourceName(), child, propertiesToErrorFor.get(name),\n            Warnings.INVALIDATION, name,\n            (type == null ? \"null\" : type.toString()), n.toString(), \"\"));\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This causes the property name to be renamed to a unique name, which is not the expected behavior.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Renaming Strategy\nAnother possible fix is to use a different renaming strategy that does not rely on the `propertiesToErrorFor` map. For example, the function could use a unique identifier for each property, or use a different naming convention that does not conflict with existing properties. One possible implementation could be to use a UUID generator to generate a unique name for each property:\n```java\nString uniqueName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\nif (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child, processProperty(t, prop, type, uniqueName))) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that each property has a unique name, which should fix the bug.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void handleObjectLit(NodeTraversal t, Node n) {\n  for (Node child = n.getFirstChild();\n      child != null;\n      child = child.getNext()) {\n    // Maybe STRING, GET, SET\n\n    // We should never see a mix of numbers and strings.\n    String name = child.getString();\n    T type = typeSystem.getType(getScope(), n, name);\n\n    Property prop = getProperty(name);\n    if (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child,\n                               processProperty(t, prop, type, null))) {\n      // TODO(user): It doesn't look like the user can do much in this\n      // case right now.\n      if (propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n        compiler.report(JSError.make(\n            t.getSourceName(), child, propertiesToErrorFor.get(name),\n            Warnings.INVALIDATION, name,\n            (type == null ? \"null\" : type.toString()), n.toString(), \"\"));\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This causes the property name to be renamed to a unique name, which is not the expected behavior.\nSuggestion: Modify the `scheduleRenaming` Function\nA third possible fix is to modify the `scheduleRenaming` function to handle the case where the property name is already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map. This could involve adding a new parameter to the function that indicates whether the property name should be renamed or not. For example:\n```java\nboolean scheduleRenaming(Node child, Property prop, T type, String name, boolean rename) {\n    if (rename && propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n        // do not rename the property\n        return true;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that the `scheduleRenaming` function handles the case where the property name is already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map, which should fix the bug.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void handleObjectLit(NodeTraversal t, Node n) {\n  for (Node child = n.getFirstChild();\n      child != null;\n      child = child.getNext()) {\n    // Maybe STRING, GET, SET\n\n    // We should never see a mix of numbers and strings.\n    String name = child.getString();\n    T type = typeSystem.getType(getScope(), n, name);\n\n    Property prop = getProperty(name);\n    if (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child,\n                               processProperty(t, prop, type, null))) {\n      // TODO(user): It doesn't look like the user can do much in this\n      // case right now.\n      if (propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n        compiler.report(JSError.make(\n            t.getSourceName(), child, propertiesToErrorFor.get(name),\n            Warnings.INVALIDATION, name,\n            (type == null ? \"null\" : type.toString()), n.toString(), \"\"));\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
