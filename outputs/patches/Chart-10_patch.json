      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `generateToolTipFragment` does not properly escape the double quotes in the `toolTipText` parameter. In HTML, double quotes need to be escaped as `&quot;` to be displayed correctly. However, in the buggy function, the double quotes are not escaped, resulting in the incorrect output.\nSuggestion: Manual String Replacement\nReplace all occurrences of double quotes in the `toolTipText` parameter with their escaped equivalent `&quot;`. This can be done using the `replace()` method of the `String` class. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n    return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\") + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, but it may not handle all edge cases correctly.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n    return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText\n        + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

In HTML, double quotes need to be escaped as `&quot;` to be displayed correctly. However, in the buggy function, the double quotes are not escaped, resulting in the incorrect output.\nSuggestion: Using a StringBuilder\nUse a `StringBuilder` to build the tooltip string, and use the `append()` method to append the `toolTipText` parameter. This will allow us to properly escape the double quotes. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n    sb.append(\" title=\\\"\");\n    for (char c : toolTipText.toCharArray()) {\n        if (c == '\"') {\n            sb.append(\"&quot;\");\n        } else {\n            sb.append(c);\n        }\n    }\n    sb.append(\"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\");\n    return sb.toString();\n}\n```\nThis solution is more robust than the first one, but it may be less efficient.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n    return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText\n        + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Then, call this method on the `toolTipText` parameter before appending it to the tooltip string. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate String escapeDoubleQuotes(String s) {\n    return s.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\");\n}\n\npublic String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n    return \" title=\\\"\" + escapeDoubleQuotes(toolTipText) + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n}\n```\nThis solution is more modular and reusable than the first two, but it may be less efficient due to the extra method call.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String generateToolTipFragment(String toolTipText) {\n    return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText\n        + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
