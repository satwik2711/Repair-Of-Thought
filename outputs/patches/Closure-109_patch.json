      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `parseContextTypeExpression` function does not handle the '?' character correctly. The function simply calls `parseTypeName(token)`, which expects a basic type expression, but the '?' character is not a valid basic type expression. This causes a syntax error when parsing the type annotation.\nSuggestion: Handle '?' Character Explicitly\nWe can add a simple check to see if the token is a '?' character, and if so, return a special node that represents the '?' character. This would allow the parser to correctly handle the '?' character in the context type expression. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n    if (token.isQuestionMark()) {\n        return new Node(token);\n    } else {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis approach is simple and straightforward, and it avoids modifying the `parseTypeName` function.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4.

Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function simply calls `parseTypeName(token)`, which expects a basic type expression, but the '?' character is not a valid basic type expression.

Character\nAlternatively, we can modify the `parseTypeName` function to handle the '?' character correctly. This would involve adding a check to see if the token is a '?' character, and if so, parsing it as a special type of name. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate Node parseTypeName(JsDocToken token) {\n    if (token.isQuestionMark()) {\n        // parse '?' character as a special type of name\n        return new Node(token);\n    } else {\n        // existing parsing logic\n    }\n}\n```\nThis approach would require modifying the `parseTypeName` function, which could have unintended consequences if it is used elsewhere in the codebase.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function simply calls `parseTypeName(token)`, which expects a basic type expression, but the '?' character is not a valid basic type expression. This causes a syntax error when parsing the type annotation.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Parsing Function\nAnother approach would be to use a different parsing function that is specifically designed to handle context type expressions. This would allow us to avoid modifying the `parseTypeName` function and instead use a function that is better suited to parsing context type expressions. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n    return parseContextType(token);\n}\n\nprivate Node parseContextType(JsDocToken token) {\n    // parsing logic for context type expressions\n}\n```\nThis approach would add complexity to the codebase, but it would allow us to handle context type expressions in a more explicit and flexible way.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
