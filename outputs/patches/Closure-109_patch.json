      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `parseContextTypeExpression` function does not handle the '?' character correctly. The function simply calls `parseTypeName(token)`, which expects a type name, but the '?' character is not a valid type name. This causes the parser to report a syntax error.\nSuggestion: Handle '?' Character Explicitly\nWe can add a simple check to see if the token is a '?' character, and if so, return a special type that represents the '?' character. This would allow the parser to recognize the '?' character as a valid type annotation. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n    if (token.matchesToken(JsDocToken.TokenType.QUESTION_MARK)) {\n        return new Node(Type.QUESTION_MARK);\n    } else {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be the most elegant solution.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

Character\nAlternatively, we can modify the `parseTypeName` function to handle the '?' character correctly. This would involve adding a special case to the function to recognize the '?' character as a valid type name. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\nprivate Node parseTypeName(JsDocToken token) {\n    if (token.matchesToken(JsDocToken.TokenType.QUESTION_MARK)) {\n        return new Node(Type.QUESTION_MARK);\n    } else {\n        // existing implementation\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution is more invasive, as it requires modifying an existing function, but it may be more elegant and consistent with the existing code.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function simply calls `parseTypeName(token)`, which expects a type name, but the '?' character is not a valid type name. This causes the parser to report a syntax error.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Parsing Function\nAnother possible solution is to use a different parsing function that is specifically designed to handle context type expressions. This would allow us to avoid modifying the `parseTypeName` function and instead use a function that is better suited to the task. For example, we could create a new function `parseContextType` that handles the '?' character correctly, and then call this function from `parseContextTypeExpression`. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n    return parseContextType(token);\n}\n\nprivate Node parseContextType(JsDocToken token) {\n    if (token.matchesToken(JsDocToken.TokenType.QUESTION_MARK)) {\n        return new Node(Type.QUESTION_MARK);\n    } else {\n        // existing implementation\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution is more modular and flexible, as it allows us to add new parsing functions without modifying existing code.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Node parseContextTypeExpression(JsDocToken token) {\n        return parseTypeName(token);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
