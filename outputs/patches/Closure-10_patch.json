      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `mayBeString` function is not correctly handling the hook and GT operators. Specifically, the function is not correctly handling the case where the hook operator is used with a conditional expression that has a string literal as one of its branches. This is causing the function to incorrectly return true for the second input in the trigger test.\nSuggestion: Add Special Handling for Hook Operator\nOne potential fix is to add special handling for the hook operator in the `mayBeString` function. We can add a new case to the function that checks if the node is a hook operator, and if so, recursively calls the `mayBeString` function on the hook's operands. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the hook operator and returns the correct result. The modified code would be:\n```java\nstatic boolean mayBeString(Node n, boolean recurse) {\n  if (recurse) {\n    if (n instanceof Hook) {\n      return mayBeString(n.getOperand(0), recurse) || mayBeString(n.getOperand(1), recurse);\n    }\n    return allResultsMatch(n, MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE);\n  } else {\n    return mayBeStringHelper(n);\n  }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nstatic boolean mayBeString(Node n, boolean recurse) {\n  if (recurse) {\n    return allResultsMatch(n, MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE);\n  } else {\n    return mayBeStringHelper(n);\n  }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
