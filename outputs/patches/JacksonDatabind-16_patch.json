      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of this bug is that the `_add` method in the buggy function is using the `annotationType()` method to determine the key for the annotation in the `_annotations` map. However, this method returns the type of the annotation, not the name of the property that the annotation is intended to represent. As a result, when the mixin is applied, the wrong property name is being used in the serialized JSON.\nSuggestion: Use a Custom Annotation Key\nUse a custom annotation key that is specific to the mixin, rather than relying on the `annotationType()` method. This would involve adding a new field to the annotation that specifies the property name, and then using that field as the key in the `_annotations` map. For example, the annotation could be modified to include a `propertyName` field, and then the `_add` method could be modified to use that field as the key.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected final boolean _add(Annotation ann) {\n    if (_annotations == null) {\n        _annotations = new HashMap<Class<? extends Annotation>,Annotation>();\n    }\n    Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType(), ann);\n    return (previous != null) && previous.equals(ann);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
