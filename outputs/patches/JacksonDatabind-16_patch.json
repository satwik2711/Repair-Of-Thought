      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of this bug is that the `_add` method in the buggy function is using the `annotationType()` method to determine the key for the annotation in the `_annotations` map. However, this method returns the type of the annotation, not the name of the property that the annotation is intended to represent. As a result, when the mixin is applied, the wrong property name is being used in the serialized JSON.\nSuggestion: Use Annotation Name as Key\nWe can modify the `_add` method to use the name of the annotation as the key in the `_annotations` map. This can be done by using the `getSimpleName()` method of the `annotationType()` method to get the simple name of the annotation class. Here is the modified code:\n`Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType().getSimpleName(), ann);`\n// Buggy Function\nprotected final boolean _add(Annotation ann) {\n    if (_annotations == null) {\n        _annotations = new HashMap<Class<? extends Annotation>,Annotation>();\n    }\n    Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType(), ann);\n    return (previous != null) && previous.equals(ann);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

However, this method returns the type of the annotation, not the name of the property that the annotation is intended to represent.

This can be done by creating a custom class that implements the `KeyResolver` interface and using it to resolve the key for the annotation. Here is an example of how this can be done:\n`public class CustomKeyResolver implements KeyResolver {\n    @Override\n    public String resolveKey(Annotation ann) {\n        return ann.getName();\n    }\n}\n// In the _add method:\nAnnotation previous = _annotations.put(new CustomKeyResolver().resolveKey(ann), ann);`\n// Buggy Function\nprotected final boolean _add(Annotation ann) {\n    if (_annotations == null) {\n        _annotations = new HashMap<Class<? extends Annotation>,Annotation>();\n    }\n    Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType(), ann);\n    return (previous != null) && previous.equals(ann);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
