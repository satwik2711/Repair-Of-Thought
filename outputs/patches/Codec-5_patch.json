      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the buffer array is not initialized before it is accessed in the decode function. The buffer array is initialized in the resizeBuffer function, but this function is only called when the buffer array is null or its length is less than the required size. However, in the case of the testCodec98NPE test, the buffer array is not initialized before it is accessed, resulting in a NullPointerException.\nSuggestion: Initialize Buffer Array in Decode Function\nOne potential fix is to initialize the buffer array at the beginning of the decode function if it is null. This can be done by adding a null check for the buffer array and initializing it if it is null. This fix is simple and straightforward, but it may have performance implications if the buffer array is large. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nvoid decode(byte[] in, int inPos, int inAvail) {\n    if (buffer == null) {\n        buffer = new byte[1024]; // Initialize buffer array with a default size\n    }\n    // Rest of the function remains the same\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nvoid decode(byte[] in, int inPos, int inAvail) {\n    if (eof) {\n        return;\n    }\n    if (inAvail < 0) {\n        eof = true;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < inAvail; i++) {\n        if (buffer == null || buffer.length - pos < decodeSize) {\n            resizeBuffer();\n        }\n        byte b = in[inPos++];\n        if (b == PAD) {\n            // We're done.\n            eof = true;\n            break;\n        } else {\n            if (b >= 0 && b < DECODE_TABLE.length) {\n                int result = DECODE_TABLE[b];\n                if (result >= 0) {\n                    modulus = (++modulus) % 4;\n                    x = (x << 6) + result;\n                    if (modulus == 0) {\n                        buffer[pos++] = (byte) ((x >> 16) & MASK_8BITS);\n                        buffer[pos++] = (byte) ((x >> 8) & MASK_8BITS);\n                        buffer[pos++] = (byte) (x & MASK_8BITS);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Two forms of EOF as far as base64 decoder is concerned: actual\n    // EOF (-1) and first time '=' character is encountered in stream.\n    // This approach makes the '=' padding characters completely optional.\n    if (eof && modulus != 0) {\n        \n        x = x << 6;\n        switch (modulus) {\n            case 2 :\n                x = x << 6;\n                buffer[pos++] = (byte) ((x >> 16) & MASK_8BITS);\n                break;\n            case 3 :\n                buffer[pos++] = (byte) ((x >> 16) & MASK_8BITS);\n                buffer[pos++] = (byte) ((x >> 8) & MASK_8BITS);\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This fix is more efficient than the first suggestion, but it may require changes to the constructor and other parts of the class.

This method can be called before the decode function is called, ensuring that the buffer array is initialized before it is accessed. This fix is more flexible than the first two suggestions, but it may require changes to the class and its usage.
