      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the appendQuotedString function. Let me read through the problem and the suggested solution carefully.\n\nThe root cause is that when an escaped quote is followed by another quote, the function enters an infinite loop, causing an OutOfMemoryError. This happens because the function doesn't correctly handle the position after an escaped quote, leading to improper increments and loops.\n\nThe suggestion is to introduce a flag, isEscapedQuote, to track whether the current quote was escaped. This flag will help determine whether to skip the next character or not, preventing the loop.\n\nLet me look at the original function. It starts by checking if escaping is on and if the current character is a quote. If so, it appends the quote and returns. Then, in the loop, it checks for an escaped quote. If found, it appends the quote, updates the position, and continues. Otherwise, it switches on the current character. If it's a quote, it calls next(pos) and returns. Otherwise, it calls next(pos).\n\nThe problem is that after handling an escaped quote, the function doesn't correctly handle the next quote. So, when the next character is another quote, it might not advance the position correctly, causing the loop.\n\nI need to modify the function to include the isEscapedQuote flag. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Declare a boolean flag isEscapedQuote and initialize it to false.\n2. In the loop, when an escaped quote is found, set isEscapedQuote to true and skip the next(pos) call.\n3. When a quote is encountered, check if isEscapedQuote is true. If so, reset the flag and do not call next(pos). If not, proceed as before.\n4. In the default case, if isEscapedQuote is true, reset it and do not call next(pos). Otherwise, call next(pos).\n\nWait, the original function uses a switch statement. Let me see how to integrate the flag there.\n\nIn the original code, after handling the escaped quote, the code continues the loop. So, the next iteration will process the new position. But without the flag, if the next character is a quote, it might not handle it correctly.\n\nSo, in the switch case for QUOTE, I need to check if it's an escaped quote. If isEscapedQuote is true, then this quote is part of the escaped sequence, so I shouldn't advance the position again. Otherwise, it's a closing quote, so I should advance and return.\n\nSimilarly, in the default case, if isEscapedQuote is true, I shouldn't advance the position because the previous character was an escaped quote, and we've already processed it.\n\nLet me sketch the modified code:\n\n- Add boolean isEscapedQuote = false; before the loop.\n- In the escaped quote handling block: set isEscapedQuote to true.\n- Inside the switch case for QUOTE:\n  - If isEscapedQuote is true, set it to false and do not call next(pos). Just return the appended string.\n  - Else, call next(pos) and return.\n- In the default case:\n  - If isEscapedQuote is true, set it to false and do not call next(pos).\n  - Else, call next(pos).\n\nWait, but in the default case, the current character is not a quote. So, if isEscapedQuote is true, it means the previous character was an escaped quote, and we're now at the next character which is not a quote. So, we need to reset the flag and not advance the position because the position was already set when handling the escaped quote.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should adjust the code as follows:\n\nWhen handling the escaped quote, after appending and setting the position, set isEscapedQuote to true and continue the loop. Then, in the next iteration, when checking the current character, if it's a quote and isEscapedQuote is true, we treat it as part of the string, append it, and reset the flag without advancing the position.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think about the flow.\n\nAfter processing an escaped quote, the position is set to i + ESCAPED_QUOTE.length(). So, for example, if the string is \"He said \\\"Hello\\\"\", when i is at the position of the backslash, it appends the quote, sets pos to i+2 (assuming ESCAPED_QUOTE is \"\\\\\", so length 2). Then, the loop continues from the new position.\n\nBut the problem arises when the next character after the escaped quote is another quote. For example, \"This is a \\\"test\\\"\". Wait, no, that's a properly escaped quote. The issue is when after an escaped quote, another quote comes, which might cause the function to loop.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that after appending the escaped quote, the next character is a quote, which the function then processes as the end of the string, but because the position isn't correctly advanced, it loops.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function doesn't handle the case where after an escaped quote, the next character is another quote, leading to the position not being advanced correctly, causing an infinite loop.\n\nSo, the fix is to track whether the current quote is escaped. When an escaped quote is found, set the flag. Then, when a quote is encountered, if the flag is set, treat it as part of the string and reset the flag without advancing the position. Otherwise, treat it as the end of the string.\n\nLet me try to structure the code accordingly.\n\nIn the loop:\n\n- Check if escaping is on and the current position starts with an escaped quote. If so, append the quote, set pos, set lastHold, set isEscapedQuote to true, and continue.\n- Else, switch on the current character.\n  - If it's a quote:\n    - If isEscapedQuote is true, then this quote is part of the string. So, append from lastHold to current position, reset isEscapedQuote, and do not advance pos. Then, return the appended string.\n    - Else, it's the end of the string. Advance pos, append, and return.\n  - Default: append the character. If isEscapedQuote is true, reset it and do not advance pos. Else, advance pos.\n\nWait, no. Because in the default case, the current character is not a quote. So, if isEscapedQuote is true, it means the previous character was an escaped quote, and the current character is part of the string. So, we shouldn't advance the position because it was already set when handling the escaped quote.\n\nWait, perhaps the logic is:\n\n- When an escaped quote is processed, the position is set to after the escaped quote. So, the next character is the one after that. But if that next character is a quote, it's part of the string, not the end of the quoted string.\n\nSo, in the code, after handling the escaped quote, the next iteration will process the next character. If that's a quote, and isEscapedQuote is true, then it's part of the string, so we shouldn't end the quoted string.\n\nSo, in the switch case for QUOTE:\n\nif (isEscapedQuote) {\n    // This quote is part of the string, not the end.\n    isEscapedQuote = false;\n    // Do not advance pos, because the pos is already at this quote.\n    // So, we need to include this quote in the appended string.\n    // Wait, but how? Because the current code in the switch is when c[pos.getIndex()] is QUOTE.\n    // So, perhaps in this case, we should not return, but instead continue processing.\n    // Hmm, maybe the structure needs to change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should collect all characters until it finds a non-escaped quote.\n\nWait, perhaps the original function's structure is flawed because it returns immediately upon finding a quote, without considering whether it's escaped.\n\nSo, the main issue is that after an escaped quote, the next quote is treated as the end of the string, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the fix is to track whether the current quote is escaped. If it is, then the quote is part of the string, and we shouldn't end the quoted string.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- After handling an escaped quote, set isEscapedQuote to true.\n- Then, when a quote is encountered, check if isEscapedQuote is true.\n  - If yes, then this quote is part of the string. So, append it, reset the flag, and continue.\n  - If no, then it's the end of the string. Append and return.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, when a quote is found, it appends from lastHold to current position, then returns. So, perhaps the logic should be adjusted to handle the escaped quote scenario.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\nInitialize isEscapedQuote as false.\n\nIn the loop:\n\nCheck for escaped quote:\nif (escapingOn && pattern.substring(i).startsWith(ESCAPED_QUOTE)) {\n    appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold).append(QUOTE);\n    pos.setIndex(i + ESCAPED_QUOTE.length());\n    lastHold = pos.getIndex();\n    isEscapedQuote = true;\n    continue;\n}\n\nThen, check the current character:\n\nswitch (c[pos.getIndex()]) {\ncase QUOTE:\n    if (isEscapedQuote) {\n        // This quote is part of the string, not the end.\n        isEscapedQuote = false;\n        // Do not advance pos, because the current position is the quote.\n        // So, we need to include this quote in the next append.\n        // Wait, but the code is inside the switch, which is after the escaped quote handling.\n        // So, perhaps we should not return here, but instead let the loop continue.\n        // Because if we return, we would miss adding this quote to the appendTo.\n        // Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\n        // Maybe, instead of returning, we should just break out of the switch and let the loop continue.\n        // But then, how to append this quote.\n\n        // Alternatively, perhaps the structure needs to be changed so that the appending happens after processing each character.\n\n        // Maybe the function should accumulate characters in a temporary buffer and then append once at the end.\n\n        // Alternatively, perhaps the function should not return immediately when a quote is found, but instead continue until the end quote is found without being escaped.\n\n        // This suggests that the original function's approach is flawed because it returns as soon as a quote is found, without considering if it's escaped.\n\n        // So, perhaps a better approach is to loop through each character, appending as we go, and only return when an unescaped quote is found.\n\n        // Let me think about restructuring the code.\n\n        // Maybe the function should:\n\n        // - Start at the current position.\n        // - Loop through each character:\n            // - If escaping is on and the current position is an escaped quote, append the quote, advance position by the length of the escape, and continue.\n            // - Else, if the current character is a quote and not escaped, break and return.\n            // - Else, append the character and advance position.\n        // - After breaking, append the collected characters.\n\n        // But the original function appends in chunks, using lastHold to track the start of the chunk.\n\n        // So, perhaps integrating the isEscapedQuote flag into the existing structure is the way to go.\n\n        // Let me try to adjust the code step by step.\n\n        // After handling the escaped quote and setting isEscapedQuote to true, the next iteration will process the next character.\n\n        // So, in the next iteration, i is now at pos.getIndex(), which is after the escaped quote.\n\n        // Then, in the switch, if the current character is a quote, and isEscapedQuote is true, then this quote is part of the string.\n\n        // So, in this case, we should not return, but instead continue processing.\n\n        // Therefore, in the switch case for QUOTE:\n\n        if (isEscapedQuote) {\n            isEscapedQuote = false;\n            // Do not call next(pos), because the position is already at this quote.\n            // So, we need to include this quote in the append.\n            // But how? Because the code in the switch is inside the loop.\n\n            // Perhaps, in this case, we should not return, but instead let the loop continue, and the next iteration will handle the next character.\n\n            // So, we can break out of the switch, and the loop will continue.\n\n            // But then, we need to make sure that the quote is included in the append.\n\n            // Wait, the appendTo is built by appending from lastHold to the current position.\n\n            // So, when the quote is encountered and isEscapedQuote is true, we need to include it in the append.\n\n            // So, perhaps we should calculate the length from lastHold to the current position, append that substring, and then reset lastHold.\n\n            // But I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\n            // Maybe, in the case where isEscapedQuote is true and the current character is a quote, we should append the quote and continue.\n\n            // So, in code:\n\n            appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold + 1); // +1 to include the current quote\n            lastHold = pos.getIndex() + 1;\n            isEscapedQuote = false;\n            next(pos); // advance past the quote\n            continue;\n\n            // Wait, but this might not fit into the existing structure.\n\n            // Alternatively, perhaps the function should not return when a quote is found, but instead continue until it finds a quote that is not escaped.\n\n            // So, the function should collect all characters, including quotes that are escaped, until it finds a quote that is not escaped.\n\n            // Therefore, the function's structure needs to change to accumulate the string and only return when an unescaped quote is found.\n\n            // So, perhaps the function should be restructured as follows:\n\n            // - Initialize variables.\n            // - Loop:\n                // - Check for escaped quote. If found, append and advance.\n                // - Else, check if current character is a quote. If so, and not escaped, break and return.\n                // - Else, append the character and advance.\n\n            // But the original function uses a switch statement and appends chunks, which complicates things.\n\n            // Maybe the best approach is to follow the suggested fix and integrate the isEscapedQuote flag into the existing code.\n\n            // So, in the switch case for QUOTE:\n\n            if (isEscapedQuote) {\n                isEscapedQuote = false;\n                // Do not advance pos, because the current position is the quote.\n                // So, we need to include this quote in the next append.\n                // But since we're in the switch, perhaps we can just break and let the loop continue.\n                // However, the code in the switch is designed to return immediately when a quote is found.\n\n                // This suggests that the original function's structure is not conducive to handling escaped quotes correctly.\n\n                // Therefore, perhaps the function needs to be restructured to handle the appending correctly, ensuring that escaped quotes and subsequent quotes are handled without causing loops.\n\n                // Alternatively, perhaps the function can be modified to not return immediately when a quote is found, but instead continue processing until it finds the closing quote that is not escaped.\n\n                // Given the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to implement the suggested fix with the flag and adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo, integrating the flag:\n\n- Declare boolean isEscapedQuote = false before the loop.\n- In the escaped quote handling block, set isEscapedQuote to true.\n- In the switch case for QUOTE:\n  - If isEscapedQuote is true, reset the flag, do not call next(pos), and return the appended string including this quote.\n  - Else, call next(pos) and return.\n- In the default case:\n  - If isEscapedQuote is true, reset the flag and do not call next(pos).\n  - Else, call next(pos).\n\nWait, but in the default case, the current character is not a quote. So, if isEscapedQuote is true, it means the previous character was an escaped quote, and the current character is part of the string. So, we shouldn't advance the position because it's already at the current character.\n\nWait, no. Because when we process an escaped quote, we set pos to i + ESCAPED_QUOTE.length(), which is the position after the escaped quote. So, the next iteration starts at that position. So, if the next character is a quote, it's processed in the switch case.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nif (escapingOn && pattern.substring(i).startsWith(ESCAPED_QUOTE)) {\n    appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold).append(QUOTE);\n    pos.setIndex(i + ESCAPED_QUOTE.length());\n    lastHold = pos.getIndex();\n    isEscapedQuote = true;\n    continue;\n}\n\nswitch (c[pos.getIndex()]) {\ncase QUOTE:\n    if (isEscapedQuote) {\n        // This quote is part of the string, not the end.\n        isEscapedQuote = false;\n        // Append from lastHold to current position (which is the quote)\n        appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold + 1);\n        // Reset lastHold to current position +1\n        lastHold = pos.getIndex() + 1;\n        // Do not advance pos, because the next iteration will start from the next character.\n        // So, we set pos to lastHold -1 so that the next loop increments it.\n        pos.setIndex(lastHold);\n        continue;\n    } else {\n        next(pos);\n        return appendTo == null ? null : appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold);\n    }\ndefault:\n    if (isEscapedQuote) {\n        isEscapedQuote = false;\n        // Do not advance pos, because the current character is part of the string after an escaped quote.\n        // So, we include it in the next append.\n        // But wait, the default case is when the current character is not a quote.\n        // So, if isEscapedQuote is true, it means the previous character was an escaped quote, and the current character is part of the string.\n        // So, we shouldn't advance the position because it's already at the current character.\n        // So, we can just continue the loop, and the next iteration will process this character.\n        continue;\n    } else {\n        next(pos);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the default case, if isEscapedQuote is true, we reset it and continue without advancing. That way, the next iteration will process the same position again, which might cause an infinite loop.\n\nHmm, perhaps in the default case, when isEscapedQuote is true, we should advance the position because the current character is not a quote, so it's part of the string.\n\nWait, no. Because after an escaped quote, the position is set to after the escaped quote. So, the next character is the one after that. So, if that character is not a quote, it should be appended, and the position should be advanced.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to structure the code as per the suggestion.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n- When an escaped quote is found, set isEscapedQuote to true.\n- When a quote is found and isEscapedQuote is true, treat it as part of the string, append it, and reset the flag.\n- When a quote is found and isEscapedQuote is false, treat it as the end of the string.\n- In the default case, if isEscapedQuote is true, reset the flag and do not advance the position, because the current character is part of the string after an escaped quote.\n\nWait, but in the default case, the current character is not a quote. So, if isEscapedQuote is true, it means the previous character was an escaped quote, and the current character is part of the string. So, we should include it in the append, but since the position is already at this character, we don't need to advance it. However, in the default case, the code would have called next(pos), which advances it. So, to prevent that, when isEscapedQuote is true, we don't call next(pos).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nIn the default case:\n\nif (isEscapedQuote) {\n    isEscapedQuote = false;\n    // Do not call next(pos), because the current character is part of the string after an escaped quote.\n    // So, we leave the position as is, and the next iteration will process the next character.\n} else {\n    next(pos);\n}\n\nBut wait, if we don't call next(pos), the position remains the same, causing an infinite loop. Because the loop increments i, but if the position isn't advanced, i will eventually catch up and the loop will process the same position again.\n\nSo, perhaps in the default case, when isEscapedQuote is true, we should advance the position by one, because the current character is part of the string.\n\nWait, no. Because the position is already at the current character. So, perhaps the default case should always advance the position, except when isEscapedQuote is true and the current character is a quote.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of an example.\n\nExample 1: \"He said \\\"Hello\\\"\"\n\n- The function starts at the first quote after \"He said \".\n- It appends everything until it finds the closing quote.\n\nBut in the buggy code, if after an escaped quote, another quote is found, it causes a loop.\n\nAnother example: \"This is a \\\"\\\" quote\".\n\nIn this case, the string has two quotes in a row, which is an escaped quote followed by another quote.\n\nIn the original code, after handling the first escaped quote (the \\\"), the position is set to after the \\\". The next character is \", which is a quote. So, the function would process it as the end of the string, but since the position is not advanced correctly, it might loop.\n\nWith the fix, when the second quote is encountered and isEscapedQuote is true, it should be treated as part of the string, not the end.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWhen processing the second quote:\n\n- isEscapedQuote is true.\n- So, append the quote, reset the flag, and do not advance the position.\n- Then, the loop continues, and the next character is processed.\n\nWait, but if we don't advance the position, the next iteration will process the same quote again, causing an infinite loop.\n\nSo, perhaps in the switch case for QUOTE when isEscapedQuote is true, we should advance the position.\n\nWait, no. Because the position is at the quote, and we've included it in the append. So, we need to advance the position past it.\n\nSo, perhaps in the switch case for QUOTE:\n\nif (isEscapedQuote) {\n    isEscapedQuote = false;\n    // Append the current quote\n    appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold + 1);\n    lastHold = pos.getIndex() + 1;\n    next(pos); // Advance past the quote\n    continue;\n} else {\n    // ... existing code\n}\n\nBut then, this would require restructuring the code to handle appending in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should be restructured to handle all characters, appending as it goes, and only returning when an unescaped quote is found.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps it's better to proceed with integrating the flag as suggested, adjusting the code in the switch cases.\n\nSo, the modified code would be:\n\nprivate StringBuffer appendQuotedString(String pattern, ParsePosition pos,\n        StringBuffer appendTo, boolean escapingOn) {\n    int start = pos.getIndex();\n    char[] c = pattern.toCharArray();\n    if (escapingOn && c[start] == QUOTE) {\n        return appendTo == null ? null : appendTo.append(QUOTE);\n    }\n    int lastHold = start;\n    boolean isEscapedQuote = false;\n    for (int i = pos.getIndex(); i < pattern.length(); i++) {\n        if (",
      "private StringBuffer appendQuotedString(String pattern, ParsePosition pos,\n        StringBuffer appendTo, boolean escapingOn) {\n    int start = pos.getIndex();\n    char[] c = pattern.toCharArray();\n    if (escapingOn && c[start] == QUOTE) {\n        return appendTo == null ? null : appendTo.append(QUOTE);\n    }\n    int lastHold = start;\n    while (pos.getIndex() < pattern.length()) {\n        char current = c[pos.getIndex()];\n        if (current == QUOTE) {\n            break;\n        }\n        if (escapingOn && pattern.substring(pos.getIndex()).startsWith(ESCAPED_QUOTE)) {\n            appendTo.append(c, lastHold, pos.getIndex() - lastHold).append(QUOTE);\n            pos.setIndex(pos.getIndex() + ESCAPED_QUOTE.length());\n            lastHold = pos.getIndex();\n            continue;\n        }\n        switch (current) {\n        case QUOTE:\n            next(pos);\n            return appendTo == null ? null : appendTo.append(c, lastHold,\n                    pos.getIndex() - lastHold);\n        default:\n            next(pos);\n        }\n    }\n    if (pos.getIndex() < pattern.length() && c[pos.getIndex()] == QUOTE) {\n        next(pos);\n        return appendTo == null ? null : appendTo.append(c, lastHold,\n                pos.getIndex() - lastHold);\n    } else {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\n                \"Unterminated quoted string at position \" + start);\n    }\n}"
