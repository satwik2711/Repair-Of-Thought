      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the distance function does not handle the case where the input points are null. When the distance function is called with a null point, it throws a NullPointerException. This exception is then propagated up the call stack and eventually causes the NullPointerException in the assignPointsToClusters method.\nSuggestion: Add Null Checks\nOne potential fix is to add null checks at the beginning of the distance function. If either of the input points is null, the function can throw an exception or return a default value. This would prevent the NullPointerException from occurring. The modified distance function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static double distance(int[] p1, int[] p2) {\n    if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {\n        throw new NullPointerException(\"Input points cannot be null\");\n    }\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {\n        final int dp = p1[i] - p2[i];\n        sum += dp * dp;\n    }\n    return Math.sqrt(sum);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static double distance(int[] p1, int[] p2) {\n  int sum = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {\n      final int dp = p1[i] - p2[i];\n      sum += dp * dp;\n  }\n  return Math.sqrt(sum);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When the distance function is called with a null point, it throws a NullPointerException. This exception is then propagated up the call stack and eventually causes the NullPointerException in the assignPointsToClusters method.\nSuggestion: Use Optional\nAnother potential fix is to use the Optional class to handle the case where the input points are null. The distance function can return an Optional<Double> instead of a double, and the caller can handle the case where the result is empty. The modified distance function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static Optional<Double> distance(int[] p1, int[] p2) {\n    if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {\n        return Optional.empty();\n    }\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {\n        final int dp = p1[i] - p2[i];\n        sum += dp * dp;\n    }\n    return Optional.of(Math.sqrt(sum));\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static double distance(int[] p1, int[] p2) {\n  int sum = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {\n      final int dp = p1[i] - p2[i];\n      sum += dp * dp;\n  }\n  return Math.sqrt(sum);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When the distance function is called with a null point, it throws a NullPointerException. This exception is then propagated up the call stack and eventually causes the NullPointerException in the assignPointsToClusters method.\nSuggestion: Use Defensive Programming with Default Value\nA third potential fix is to use defensive programming techniques to handle the case where the input points are null. The distance function can check if the input points are null and return a default value if they are. This would prevent the NullPointerException from occurring. The modified distance function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static double distance(int[] p1, int[] p2) {\n    if (p1 == null || p2 == null) {\n        return Double.NaN; // or any other default value\n    }\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {\n        final int dp = p1[i] - p2[i];\n        sum += dp * dp;\n    }\n    return Math.sqrt(sum);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static double distance(int[] p1, int[] p2) {\n  int sum = 0;\n  for (int i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {\n      final int dp = p1[i] - p2[i];\n      sum += dp * dp;\n  }\n  return Math.sqrt(sum);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
