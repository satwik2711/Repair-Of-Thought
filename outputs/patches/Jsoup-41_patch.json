      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the equals method is not correctly implemented. The method is currently checking if the two elements are the same object, which is not the correct way to check for equality. The method should be checking if the two elements have the same HTML content.\nSuggestion: Compare HTML Content\nOne potential fix is to compare the HTML content of the two elements. We can do this by comparing the outerHTML of the two elements. Here is an example of how the equals method could be modified:\n```java\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n    return this.outerHtml().equals(element.outerHtml());\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, but it may not work correctly if the HTML content of the elements is not identical.\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;\n\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n\n    return this == o;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The method is currently checking if the two elements are the same object, which is not the correct way to check for equality. The method should be checking if the two elements have the same HTML content.\nSuggestion: Compare Tag Name, Attributes, and Text Content\nAnother potential fix is to compare the tag name, attributes, and text content of the two elements. We can do this by comparing the tagName, attributes, and text of the two elements. Here is an example of how the equals method could be modified:\n```java\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n    return this.tagName().equals(element.tagName()) \n           && this.attributes().equals(element.attributes()) \n           && this.text().equals(element.text());\n}\n```\nThis solution is more comprehensive than the first one, but it may still not work correctly if the elements have different child elements or attributes.\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;\n\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n\n    return this == o;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The method is currently checking if the two elements are the same object, which is not the correct way to check for equality. The method should be checking if the two elements have the same HTML content.\nSuggestion: Compare Normalized HTML Content\nA third potential fix is to compare the normalized HTML content of the two elements. We can do this by normalizing the HTML content of the elements before comparing them. Here is an example of how the equals method could be modified:\n```java\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n    String thisHtml = this.outerHtml().replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \"\").toLowerCase();\n    String elementHtml = element.outerHtml().replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \"\").toLowerCase();\n    return thisHtml.equals(elementHtml);\n}\n```\nThis solution is more robust than the first two, but it may still not work correctly if the elements have different attributes or child elements.\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;\n\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n\n    return this == o;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
