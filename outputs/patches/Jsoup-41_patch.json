      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is not correctly comparing the HTML content of the two elements. The method is currently checking if the two elements are the same object, which is not the correct way to compare HTML content. The method should be comparing the HTML content of the two elements, not their object references.\nSuggestion: Compare HTML Content\nCompare the `outerHtml` of the two elements to determine if they are equal. This can be done by using the `equals` method to compare the `outerHtml` strings of the two elements. This approach is simple and straightforward, but it may not be sufficient if the two elements have different tag names or attributes.\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;\n\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n\n    return this == o;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The method should be comparing the HTML content of the two elements, not their object references.\nSuggestion: Compare Tag Name and Attributes\nCompare the `tagName` and `attributes` of the two elements, in addition to their HTML content, to determine if they are equal.

The method is currently checking if the two elements are the same object, which is not the correct way to compare HTML content. The method should be comparing the HTML content of the two elements, not their object references.\nSuggestion: Use a Combination of Both\nUse a combination of both suggestions 1 and 2 to determine if the two elements are equal. This can be done by using the `equals` method to compare the `outerHtml`, `tagName`, and `attributes` of the two elements. This approach is the most comprehensive of the three suggestions, and it ensures that the two elements are equal in terms of their HTML content, tag name, and attributes.\n\nHere is the debugged code:\n\n```java\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;\n\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n\n    //\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean equals(Object o) {\n    if (this == o) return true;\n    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;\n\n    Element element = (Element) o;\n\n    return this == o;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
