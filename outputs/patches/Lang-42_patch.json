      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The function is not handling high Unicode characters correctly because it is not considering the surrogate pairs in the input string. In UTF-16 encoding, high Unicode characters are represented as surrogate pairs, which are two 16-bit code units that together represent a single Unicode character. The function is treating each code unit separately, resulting in incorrect output.\nSuggestion: Handle Surrogate Pairs\nWe can modify the function to check if the current character is a high surrogate (0xD800 to 0xDBFF) and if the next character is a low surrogate (0xDC00 to 0xDFFF). If so, we can combine the two characters to form a single Unicode character and escape it accordingly. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check for surrogate pairs and then combining them to form a single Unicode character.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void escape(Writer writer, String str) throws IOException {\n    int len = str.length();\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = str.charAt(i);\n        String entityName = this.entityName(c);\n        if (entityName == null) {\n            if (c > 0x7F) {\n                writer.write(\"&#\");\n                writer.write(Integer.toString(c, 10));\n                writer.write(';');\n            } else {\n                writer.write(c);\n            }\n        } else {\n            writer.write('&');\n            writer.write(entityName);\n            writer.write(';');\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

In UTF-16 encoding, high Unicode characters are represented as surrogate pairs, which are two 16-bit code units that together represent a single Unicode character. The function is treating each code unit separately, resulting in incorrect output.\nSuggestion: Use Unicode Code Point\nWe can modify the function to use the Unicode code point of the character instead of its UTF-16 code unit. This will allow us to handle high Unicode characters correctly, even if they are represented as surrogate pairs. We can use the Character.codePointAt() method to get the Unicode code point of the character.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void escape(Writer writer, String str) throws IOException {\n    int len = str.length();\n    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n        char c = str.charAt(i);\n        String entityName = this.entityName(c);\n        if (entityName == null) {\n            if (c > 0x7F) {\n                writer.write(\"&#\");\n                writer.write(Integer.toString(c, 10));\n                writer.write(';');\n            } else {\n                writer.write(c);\n            }\n        } else {\n            writer.write('&');\n            writer.write(entityName);\n            writer.write(';');\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function is treating each code unit separately, resulting in incorrect output.\nSuggestion: Use a Unicode-Aware Library\nWe can modify the function to use a Unicode-aware library, such as the ICU library, to handle the escaping of high Unicode characters.
