      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `OutOfMemoryError` is likely caused by the large size of the input matrix in the `testLargeSample` test. The `EigenDecomposition` class is trying to create a new `DiagonalMatrix` instance, which requires a significant amount of memory. The `testLargeSample` test is creating a large number of observed points (40,000) and fitting a polynomial of degree up to 10, which results in a large weight matrix being passed to the `squareRoot` function.\nSuggestion: Reduce Matrix Size\nOne possible solution is to reduce the size of the input matrix by using a smaller number of observed points or a lower degree polynomial. This would reduce the memory usage of the `EigenDecomposition` class and prevent the `OutOfMemoryError`. However, this might affect the accuracy of the polynomial fit.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {\n        final EigenDecomposition dec = new EigenDecomposition(m);\n        return dec.getSquareRoot();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The `testLargeSample` test is creating a large number of observed points (40,000) and fitting a polynomial of degree up to 10, which results in a large weight matrix being passed to the `squareRoot` function.\nSuggestion: Use a More Efficient Decomposition Algorithm\nAnother possible solution is to use a more efficient decomposition algorithm that requires less memory. For example, we could use the `CholeskyDecomposition` class instead of `EigenDecomposition`. This would require modifying the `squareRoot` function to use the `CholeskyDecomposition` class. Here's an example of how the modified `squareRoot` function could look like:\n```java\nprivate RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {\n    final CholeskyDecomposition dec = new CholeskyDecomposition(m);\n    return dec.getL();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {\n        final EigenDecomposition dec = new EigenDecomposition(m);\n        return dec.getSquareRoot();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This would require modifying the JVM settings and might not be feasible in all environments. For example, you could add the following option to the JVM command line:\n```bash\n-Xmx1024m\n```\nThis would increase the heap size to 1024 MB. However, this solution might not be feasible in all environments, and it's generally better to optimize the code instead of relying on increased heap size.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {\n        final EigenDecomposition dec = new EigenDecomposition(m);\n        return dec.getSquareRoot();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
