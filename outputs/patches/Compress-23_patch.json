      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `decode` function does not handle dictionary sizes that are too big for the `LZMAInputStream` implementation. The function checks if the dictionary size is within the allowed limit, but it does not account for the fact that the `LZMAInputStream` implementation has a smaller limit.\nSuggestion: Check Dictionary Size Against LZMAInputStream Limit\nWe can modify the `decode` function to check the dictionary size against the limit of the `LZMAInputStream` implementation, rather than the general limit of 4GiB. This will ensure that the function does not create an `LZMAInputStream` with a dictionary size that is too big. The modified code will be:\n```java\nInputStream decode(final InputStream in, final Coder coder,\n        byte[] password) throws IOException {\n    byte propsByte = coder.properties[0];\n    long dictSize = coder.properties[1];\n    for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {\n        dictSize |= (coder.properties[i + 1] << (8 * i));\n    }\n    if (dictSize > LZMAInputStream.DICT_SIZE_MAX) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Dictionary size is too big for LZMAInputStream implementation\");\n    }\n    if (dictSize > LZMAInputStream.MAX_DICT_SIZE) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Dictionary size is too big for LZMAInputStream implementation\");\n    }\n    return new LZMAInputStream(in, -1, propsByte, (int) dictSize);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nInputStream decode(final InputStream in, final Coder coder,\n        byte[] password) throws IOException {\n    byte propsByte = coder.properties[0];\n    long dictSize = coder.properties[1];\n    for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {\n        dictSize |= (coder.properties[i + 1] << (8 * i));\n    }\n    if (dictSize > LZMAInputStream.DICT_SIZE_MAX) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Dictionary larger than 4GiB maximum size\");\n    }\n    return new LZMAInputStream(in, -1, propsByte, (int) dictSize);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function checks if the dictionary size is within the allowed limit, but it does not account for the fact that the `LZMAInputStream` implementation has a smaller limit.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Implementation for Large Dictionary Sizes\nWe can modify the `decode` function to use a different implementation for dictionary sizes that are too big for the `LZMAInputStream` implementation. For example, we could use a different decompression algorithm or a different implementation of the `LZMAInputStream` class. This would require significant changes to the code, but it would allow us to handle large dictionary sizes correctly.\n// Buggy Function\nInputStream decode(final InputStream in, final Coder coder,\n        byte[] password) throws IOException {\n    byte propsByte = coder.properties[0];\n    long dictSize = coder.properties[1];\n    for (int i = 1; i < 4; i++) {\n        dictSize |= (coder.properties[i + 1] << (8 * i));\n    }\n    if (dictSize > LZMAInputStream.DICT_SIZE_MAX) {\n        throw new IOException(\"Dictionary larger than 4GiB maximum size\");\n    }\n    return new LZMAInputStream(in, -1, propsByte, (int) dictSize);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
