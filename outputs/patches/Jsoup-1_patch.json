      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the buggy `normalise` function. Let me start by understanding the problem. The root cause is that non-blank text nodes aren't being moved to the beginning of the body correctly. Instead, they're being appended to the end. So, the order is wrong.\n\nLooking at the original code, it collects all non-blank text nodes into `toMove`. Then, it iterates over each node in `toMove`, removes it from the element, appends a space, and then appends the node to the body. But since it's appending each node in the order they appear, they end up at the end of the body, not the beginning.\n\nThe suggestion is to reverse the order of the moved nodes before appending. So, I should collect them in `toMove`, reverse the list, and then process each node. That way, the first node in the original order is moved last, effectively placing it at the beginning when reversed.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the original order is A, B, C. If I reverse toMove to C, B, A, then when I append them, each will be added after the previous. So the order in the body would be C, B, A. But I want them to be at the beginning, so maybe I need to prepend them instead of appending. Hmm, perhaps the original approach of appending in reverse order will place them in the correct order at the beginning.\n\nWait, no. Because when you append nodes in reverse order, each new node is added after the previous. So if the original nodes were A, B, C, and you reverse to C, B, A, then appending C first, then B, then A would result in C, B, A in the body. But the body already has other content. So perhaps the correct approach is to insert them at the beginning, but the current code appends to the end.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that when you move the nodes, you're adding them to the end, so their order is reversed compared to their original position. So by reversing the list before appending, you maintain the original order but place them at the end. But that's not what we want. We want them to be moved to the beginning, but in the correct order.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you remove each node and append it, the order in which you append them affects their position. For example, if you have nodes A, B, C in the element, and you move them in that order, each append adds them to the end of the body. So the body would have A, B, C added in that order, but if the body already has content, these would be at the end. But the goal is to move them to the beginning.\n\nWait, maybe the function is supposed to move all non-blank text nodes to the beginning of the body, maintaining their order. So if the original element has text nodes in the order A, B, C, after normalization, the body should have A, B, C at the beginning, followed by other content.\n\nBut in the original code, when you process each node in the order A, B, C, you remove them and append them to the body. So the body would end up with A, B, C added in that order, but each append adds to the end. So if the body was empty, that's fine. But if the body already has content, these would be added after, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is intended to collect all non-blank text nodes from the given element and move them to the beginning of the body, in the same order they appeared in the element.\n\nSo, the problem is that in the original code, when you process the nodes in the order A, B, C, you remove each and append to the body. So the body ends up with A, B, C in that order, but if the body had existing nodes, these would be added after. But the goal is to have them at the beginning.\n\nWait, maybe the function is supposed to move the text nodes to the beginning of the body, not just the end. So, perhaps the approach should be to insert them before other content.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when you append the nodes in the original order, they end up in reverse order in the body because each append is after the previous. So, to maintain the original order, you need to reverse the list before appending.\n\nWait, let's think with an example. Suppose the element has text nodes in the order T1, T2, T3. The original code would process T1 first: remove it from the element, append a space, then append T1 to the body. Then T2: remove, append space, append T2. Then T3: same.\n\nSo, the body would have T1, T2, T3, each added after the previous. So the order is T1, T2, T3 in the body. But if the body had other nodes before, these would be added after, which might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is intended to move all non-blank text nodes to the beginning of the body, in the same order as they appeared in the element. So, the first text node should be the first in the body, followed by the second, etc.\n\nBut in the original code, when you process T1, you append it to the body, which adds it to the end. Then T2 is appended after T1, and T3 after T2. So, if the body was empty, this is correct. But if the body had other nodes, these text nodes would be added after, which is not the beginning.\n\nWait, maybe the function is supposed to collect all non-blank text nodes from the given element and prepend them to the body, maintaining their order.\n\nSo, the correct approach would be to collect the nodes in the order they appear, then prepend them one by one. But prepending in a for-loop can be tricky because inserting at the beginning affects the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to move the text nodes to the beginning of the body, but the original code appends them to the end, which is wrong.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the function is appending to the end instead of the beginning. So, the fix is to reverse the order of the moved nodes before appending them to the end, which would place them in the correct order at the beginning.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If you reverse the order and then append, they would be added in reverse order at the end, which would not be the beginning.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe root cause is that the function is appending the moved text nodes to the end of the body instead of the beginning. So, the nodes are being moved but placed at the end, not the beginning.\n\nThe suggestion is to reverse the order of the moved nodes before appending. So, for example, if the nodes are A, B, C, reversing gives C, B, A. Then, when you append each, they are added in the order C, B, A to the end of the body. But that would place them in reverse order at the end, which doesn't solve the problem of moving them to the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the function is moving the nodes to the end of the body, but they should be moved to the beginning. So, the correct approach is to insert them at the beginning, not append.\n\nBut how to do that? Because in the original code, each node is removed and then appended to the body, which adds it to the end.\n\nSo, to move them to the beginning, perhaps we should prepend them instead of appending. But the DOM doesn't have a prepend method; you have to insert before the first child.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to collect all the non-blank text nodes, remove them from the element, and then add them to the beginning of the body in the same order.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after removing, it appends a space and then the node. So, for each node, it's adding a space and then the node to the body. So, perhaps the intention is to have the text nodes followed by a space, but that's another issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is trying to move the non-blank text nodes to the beginning of the body, but the way it's done is incorrect because it appends them to the end. So, the nodes are moved, but their position is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct approach would be to collect the nodes, remove them, and then insert them at the beginning of the body in the correct order.\n\nBut how to do that? Because inserting nodes at the beginning requires inserting before the first child each time, which would reverse their order.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the body has existing content: X, Y, Z. The function is supposed to move A, B, C (non-blank text nodes) to the beginning. So the body should become A, B, C, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut in the original code, for each node in A, B, C:\n\n- Remove A from element.\n- Append a space to body.\n- Append A to body.\n\nSo, after processing A, body has X, Y, Z, \" \", A.\n\nThen process B: body becomes X, Y, Z, \" \", A, \" \", B.\n\nThen C: X, Y, Z, \" \", A, \" \", B, \" \", C.\n\nWhich is not moving them to the beginning.\n\nSo, the problem is that the nodes are being appended to the end, not inserted at the beginning.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to insert the nodes at the beginning, not append.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nOne approach is to collect all the nodes, remove them, then insert them in the correct order at the beginning.\n\nBut inserting nodes at the beginning requires that each node is inserted before the existing first child. So, if you have nodes A, B, C, inserting them in that order would result in C, B, A because each insertion is before the current first child.\n\nWait, no. Let me think: if the body is empty, inserting A, then B, then C would result in A, B, C. But if you insert in reverse order, C first, then B before C, then A before B, you get A, B, C.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose body is empty.\n\n- Insert C: body has C.\n- Insert B before C: body has B, C.\n- Insert A before B: body has A, B, C.\n\nSo, to get A, B, C in order, you need to insert them in reverse order.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Collect the nodes in the order they appear: A, B, C.\n2. Reverse the list: C, B, A.\n3. For each node in the reversed list, insert it at the beginning of the body.\n\nThis way, each node is added before the existing content, resulting in A, B, C in the body.\n\nSo, in the code, after collecting `toMove` as A, B, C, we reverse it to C, B, A. Then, for each node in this reversed list, we insert it at the beginning.\n\nBut in the original code, the function appends each node to the end, which is incorrect. So, to fix it, we need to reverse the `toMove` list and then insert each node at the beginning.\n\nWait, but the original code is using `body().appendChild()`, which appends to the end. So, to insert at the beginning, perhaps we need to use `insertBefore()` instead.\n\nBut in the original code, after removing the node, it appends a space and then the node. So, perhaps the space is intended to separate the moved text nodes from the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is trying to move the text nodes and add a space after each, but the order is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to move the text nodes to the beginning, each followed by a space, but the order is reversed.\n\nSo, the correct approach would be:\n\n- Collect the nodes in the order A, B, C.\n- Reverse the list to C, B, A.\n- For each node in this reversed list:\n   - Remove it from the element.\n   - Insert it at the beginning of the body.\n   - Add a space after it.\n\nWait, but how to add the space. Because inserting the node at the beginning and then adding a space would require inserting the space after the node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space is added after moving the node, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is trying to move the text nodes and ensure that each is followed by a space, but the order is incorrect.\n\nSo, to fix the order, we need to reverse the `toMove` list and then process each node, inserting them at the beginning, followed by a space.\n\nBut in the original code, the space is added before the node. Wait, no, the code appends a space and then the node. So, for each node, it appends a space and then the node. So, the order in the body would be space, node, space, node, etc.\n\nBut if we want the nodes to be at the beginning, each followed by a space, perhaps the correct approach is to insert the node first, then the space.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is supposed to move the text nodes to the beginning, each separated by a space. So, the first node is added, then a space, then the next node, and so on.\n\nIn that case, the order of the nodes is important. So, if the original order is A, B, C, the body should have A, space, B, space, C, followed by the rest of the content.\n\nBut in the original code, the nodes are being added in the order A, B, C, each after a space, but appended to the end, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, to fix this, the nodes should be added in reverse order, each inserted at the beginning, followed by a space.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Collect the nodes in the order A, B, C.\n2. Reverse the list to C, B, A.\n3. For each node in this reversed list:\n   a. Insert the node at the beginning of the body.\n   b. Insert a space after the node.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should build a list of nodes to prepend, in the correct order, and then prepend them all at once.\n\nBut in the DOM, you can't just prepend a list; you have to insert each node one by one, which affects the order.\n\nSo, to insert nodes in the order A, B, C at the beginning, you need to insert C first, then B before C, then A before B. So, the insertion order is reversed.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Collect the nodes in the order A, B, C.\n- Reverse the list to get C, B, A.\n- For each node in this list:\n   - Insert the node at the beginning of the body.\n   - Insert a space after the node.\n\nWait, but inserting the node at the beginning each time would cause each subsequent insertion to be before the previous one, thus maintaining the original order.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- Body is initially empty.\n- Insert C at beginning: body has C.\n- Insert B before C: body has B, C.\n- Insert A before B: body has A, B, C.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in code, after collecting the nodes in `toMove` as A, B, C, we reverse the list to C, B, A. Then, for each node in this reversed list, we insert it at the beginning of the body, followed by a space.\n\nBut in the original code, the space is added before the node. So, perhaps the function is adding a space and then the node, which would result in the space coming before the node in the body.\n\nWait, in the original code, for each node, it appends a space and then the node. So, the order in the body would be space, node, space, node, etc.\n\nBut if we're moving the nodes to the beginning, perhaps the space should come after the node.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should insert the node first, then insert a space after it.\n\nBut in the original code, it's appending a space and then the node. So, when moving to the beginning, we need to adjust this.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is trying to ensure that each moved text node is followed by a space. So, the correct order would be node, space, node, space, etc.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- For each node in reversed `toMove` list:\n   - Insert the node at the beginning.\n   - Insert a space after the node.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to add a space between the moved nodes and the existing content. So, after moving all the nodes to the beginning, add a space before the existing content.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space is intended to separate the moved nodes from each other. So, each moved node is followed by a space, except the last one.\n\nBut that's more complex.\n\nIn any case, the main issue is the order of the nodes. So, to fix the function, I need to reverse the `toMove` list and then process each node, inserting them at the beginning of the body.\n\nBut in the original code, the function appends the nodes to the end. So, to move them to the beginning, I need to change `appendChild` to `insertBefore`, perhaps inserting before the first child.\n\nBut in the DOM, the first child can be retrieved, and then each node is inserted before it.\n\nAlternatively, if the body is empty, inserting at the beginning is the same as appending.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. Collect the non-blank text nodes in `toMove` in the order they appear.\n2. Reverse `toMove` so that when inserting at the beginning, they are added in the original order.\n3. For each node in the reversed `toMove`:\n   a. Remove the node from the element.\n   b. Insert the node at the beginning of the body.\n   c. Insert a space after the node.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after removing the node, it appends a space and then the node. So, the space is added before the node in the body. That would place the space before the node, which might not be desired.\n\nSo, perhaps the space should be added after the node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space is intended to be between the moved nodes and the existing content. So, after moving all nodes, add a single space before the existing content.\n\nBut that's a different approach.\n\nIn any case, the main issue is the order of the nodes. So, the fix is to reverse the `toMove` list and then insert each node at the beginning.\n\nSo, in the code, after collecting `toMove`, we reverse it. Then, for each node in the reversed list, we remove it from the element and insert it at the beginning of the body, followed by a space.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the space is added before the node. So, perhaps the function is adding a space and then the node, which would place the space before the node in the body.\n\nSo, if we reverse the list and then process each node, adding a space and then the node, the nodes would be added in the correct order, but each preceded by a space.\n\nBut that might lead to leading spaces, which may not be intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space is meant to separate the moved nodes from the existing content. So, after moving all nodes, add a single space.\n\nBut that's a different approach.\n\nIn any case, the main fix is to reverse the `toMove` list so that when appending, the nodes are added in the correct order.\n\nWait, no. Because appending in the original code adds them to the end. So, reversing the list and then appending would result in the nodes being added in reverse order at the end, which is not the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to insert the nodes at the beginning, not append.\n\nSo, the code should be modified to insert each node at the beginning, after reversing the `toMove` list.\n\nBut in the original code, it's using `body().appendChild()`, which appends to the end. So, to insert at the beginning, we need to use `insertBefore()`.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Collect the nodes in `toMove` as A, B, C.\n- Reverse `toMove` to C, B, A.\n- For each node in this list:\n   - Remove the node from the element.\n   - Insert the node at the beginning of the body.\n   - Insert a space after the node.\n\nBut how to insert a space after the node. Because after inserting the node, we can insert a text node with a space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to add a space after each moved node, so the code appends a space and then the node. But that would place the space before the node, which is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is adding a space after moving the node, but the order is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space is a separator between the moved nodes.\n\nIn any case, the main issue is the order of the nodes. So, the fix is to reverse the `toMove` list and then insert each node at the beginning.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- After collecting `toMove`, reverse it.\n- For each node in reversed `toMove`:\n   - Remove the node from the element.\n   - Insert the node at the beginning of the body.\n   - Insert a space after the node.\n\nBut in the original code, it's appending a space and then the node. So, perhaps the space is intended to be before the node, which would not be correct if inserting at the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified to insert the node first, then the space.\n\nBut that would require two insertions for each node, which could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space is not necessary, but that's part of the original functionality.\n\nWait, looking back at the original code:\n\nfor each node in toMove:\n    element.removeChild(node);\n    body().appendChild(new TextNode(\" \", \"\"));\n    body().appendChild(node);\n\nSo, for each node, it appends a space and then the node. So, the order in the body becomes space, node, space, node, etc.\n\nBut when moving to the beginning, this would result in the spaces and nodes being at the end, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps the code should prepend the node and then the space, but that would require inserting before the first child each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the space should be added after all nodes are moved.\n\nBut perhaps the space is intended to separate the moved nodes from the existing content. So, after moving all nodes, add a single space.\n\nBut that's a different approach.\n\nIn any case, the main issue is the order of the nodes. So, the fix is to reverse the `toMove` list and then insert each node at the beginning, followed by a space.\n\nBut in the original code, the space is added before the node. So, perhaps the code should be modified to insert the node first, then the space.\n\nBut that would require changing the order of appends.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should collect all the nodes, reverse the list, and then for each node, insert it at the beginning, followed by a space.\n\nBut in code, that would require using `insertBefore` instead of `appendChild`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fixed function would look like this:\n\nprivate void normalise(Element element) {\n    List<Node> toMove = new ArrayList<Node>();\n    for (Node node: element.childNodes) {\n        if (node instanceof TextNode) {\n            TextNode tn = (TextNode) node;\n            if (!tn.isBlank())\n                toMove.add(tn);\n        }\n    }\n\n    Collections.reverse(toMove);\n    for"
