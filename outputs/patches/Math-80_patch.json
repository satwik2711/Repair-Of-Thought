      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the flipIfWarranted function is not correctly flipping the qd array. This is because the condition for flipping the array is not correct. The condition 1.5 * work[pingPong] < work[4 * (n - 1) + pingPong] is not sufficient to determine whether the array should be flipped. This condition is causing the array to be flipped incorrectly, resulting in incorrect eigenvalues.\nSuggestion: Modify the Condition for Flipping\nWe can modify the condition for flipping the array to be more robust. Instead of using a fixed value of 1.5, we can use a dynamic value that depends on the input values. For example, we can use the average value of the work array as the threshold for flipping. This will ensure that the array is flipped correctly even when the input values are large or small.\n\n```java\nprivate boolean flipIfWarranted(final int n, final int step) {\n    double average = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < work.length; i++) {\n        average += work[i];\n    }\n    average /= work.length;\n    if (average * work[pingPong] < work[4 * (n - 1) + pingPong]) {\n        // flip array\n        int j = 4 * n - 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < j; i += 4) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k += step) {\n                final double tmp = work[i + k];\n                work[i + k] = work[j - k];\n                work[j - k] = tmp;\n            }\n            j -= 4;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean flipIfWarranted(final int n, final int step) {\n    if (1.5 * work[pingPong] < work[4 * (n - 1) + pingPong]) {\n        // flip array\n        int j = 4 * n - 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < j; i += 4) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k += step) {\n                final double tmp = work[i + k];\n                work[i + k] = work[j - k];\n                work[j - k] = tmp;\n            }\n            j -= 4;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This condition is causing the array to be flipped incorrectly, resulting in incorrect eigenvalues.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Algorithm for Flipping\nWe can use a different algorithm for flipping the array. Instead of using a simple condition to determine whether to flip the array, we can use a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the entire array. For example, we can use a sorting algorithm to sort the array and then flip it if necessary. This will ensure that the array is flipped correctly even when the input values are complex.\n\n```java\nprivate boolean flipIfWarranted(final int n, final int step) {\n    Arrays.sort(work);\n    if (work[pingPong] < work[4 * (n - 1) + pingPong]) {\n        // flip array\n        int j = 4 * n - 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < j; i += 4) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k += step) {\n                final double tmp = work[i + k];\n                work[i + k] = work[j - k];\n                work[j - k] = tmp;\n            }\n            j -= 4;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean flipIfWarranted(final int n, final int step) {\n    if (1.5 * work[pingPong] < work[4 * (n - 1) + pingPong]) {\n        // flip array\n        int j = 4 * n - 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < j; i += 4) {\n            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k += step) {\n                final double tmp = work[i + k];\n                work[i + k] = work[j - k];\n                work[j - k] = tmp;\n            }\n            j -= 4;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
