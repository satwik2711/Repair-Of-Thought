      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `toStringEquals` function is not handling the case where the `arg` parameter is null. When `arg` is null, calling `toString()` on it throws a `NullPointerException`. This is because the `toString()` method is not defined for null objects.\nSuggestion: Check for Null Before Calling toString()\nOne potential fix is to add a null check before calling `toString()` on the `arg` parameter. This can be done using a simple if statement. If `arg` is null, we can return false immediately, since null is not equal to any string representation. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    if (arg == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

When `arg` is null, calling `toString()` on it throws a `NullPointerException`. This is because the `toString()` method is not defined for null objects.\nSuggestion: Use Optional.toString() Method\nAnother potential fix is to use the `Optional.toString()` method, which returns an empty string if the object is null. However, since `Optional` is not directly applicable here, we can use a similar approach by returning an empty string when `arg` is null. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    String argStr = arg == null ? \"\" : arg.toString();\n    return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(argStr);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When `arg` is null, calling `toString()` on it throws a `NullPointerException`. This is because the `toString()` method is not defined for null objects.\nSuggestion: Use String.valueOf() Method\nA third potential fix is to use the `String.valueOf()` method, which returns the string representation of the object, or \"null\" if the object is null. This way, we can avoid the `NullPointerException` and still get the correct result. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(String.valueOf(arg));\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean toStringEquals(Matcher m, Object arg) {\n    return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg.toString());\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
