Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue arises from the fact that the `getCurrentStream` function is being called without a prior call to `getNextEntry`. This is because the `readEntriesOfSize0` test is calling `sevenZFile.read()` without ensuring that `getNextEntry` has been called beforehand. The `getCurrentStream` function is designed to throw an exception if there is no current entry, but in this case, it's being called prematurely.\nSuggestion: Check for Current Entry Before Reading\nWe can modify the `read` function to check if there is a current entry before calling `getCurrentStream`. If there is no current entry, it can throw an exception or return a default value.
