      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function is attempting to call the real method on an abstract interface (List), which is not allowed by Mockito. Mockito only allows calling real methods on non-abstract methods. The List interface is abstract and does not provide a default implementation for the get method, which is why Mockito is throwing an exception.\nSuggestion: Return a Default Value for Abstract Methods\nOne possible solution is to return a default value when an abstract method is called. For example, we could return null or an empty list when the get method is called on a mock List object. This would allow the test to pass, but it may not be the desired behavior in all cases. Here is an example of how the buggy function could be modified to return a default value for abstract methods:\n```java\npublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n    if (invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().isInterface()) {\n        // Return a default value for abstract methods\n        if (invocation.getMethod().getName().equals(\"get\") && invocation.getArguments().length == 1) {\n            return null; // Return null for get method on List interface\n        }\n    }\n    return invocation.callRealMethod();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n        return invocation.callRealMethod();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

Mockito only allows calling real methods on non-abstract methods. The List interface is abstract and does not provide a default implementation for the get method, which is why Mockito is throwing an exception.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Mocking Strategy\nAnother possible solution is to use a different mocking strategy that allows calling real methods on abstract interfaces. For example, we could use a spy object instead of a mock object. A spy object is a real object that has been wrapped with a mock object, allowing us to call real methods on it. Here is an example of how the trigger test could be modified to use a spy object:\n```java\npublic void testCallsRealInterfaceMethod() {\n    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();\n    List<String> spyList = spy(list);\n    assertNull(spyList.get(1));\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n        return invocation.callRealMethod();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Mockito only allows calling real methods on non-abstract methods. The List interface is abstract and does not provide a default implementation for the get method, which is why Mockito is throwing an exception.\nSuggestion: Provide a Custom Implementation for Abstract Methods\nA third possible solution is to provide a custom implementation for abstract methods. For example, we could create a custom Answer object that provides a default implementation for the get method on a List interface. This would allow us to control the behavior of the mock object and ensure that it behaves correctly in all cases. Here is an example of how the buggy function could be modified to provide a custom implementation for abstract methods:\n```java\npublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n    if (invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().isInterface()) {\n        // Provide a custom implementation for abstract methods\n        if (invocation.getMethod().getName().equals(\"get\") && invocation.getArguments().length == 1) {\n            // Return a custom implementation for get method on List interface\n            return new ArrayList<>(); // Return an empty list\n        }\n    }\n    return invocation.callRealMethod();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n        return invocation.callRealMethod();\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
