      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the flatten method. The problem is that when an option has a value, like --foo=bar, the method doesn't split it correctly. So it treats the whole string as an option, which isn't recognized, causing an exception.\n\nLooking at the original code, I see that when an argument starts with a '-', it strips the hyphens and checks if the option exists. If not, it checks for a two-character option. But this doesn't handle the case where the option has an '=' sign.\n\nThe suggestion is to split the option and value when '=' is present. So I should modify the code to check if the argument contains '='. If it does, split it into parts. Then check if the first part is a valid option. If yes, add both parts as separate tokens. Otherwise, treat it as a non-option.\n\nI'll go through the code step by step.\n\nIn the loop where each argument is processed, after checking for \"--\" and \"-\", when the argument starts with '-', I'll add a condition to see if it contains '='. If so, split into parts. Then check if the first part is a valid option. If yes, add both parts. If not, maybe it's a two-character option, so I'll check that case as before.\n\nWait, the original code handles the case where the option is like -Dproperty=value. So when the argument starts with '-', and the stripped version isn't an option, it checks if the first two characters form an option. So I need to integrate the '=' check before that.\n\nSo the plan is: in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block, first check if the argument contains '='. If yes, split into opt and value. Check if opt is a valid option. If yes, add both parts. If not, check if the two-character option exists, else treat as non-option.\n\nWait, but the original code already has a part where if the stripped option isn't found, it checks for a two-character option. So maybe I should insert the '=' check before that.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When an argument starts with '-', strip leading hyphens to get opt.\n2. If options.hasOption(opt), add the arg as is.\n3. Else, check if the argument contains '='.\n   a. If yes, split into parts.\n   b. Check if the first part (without '=') is an option.\n   c. If yes, add both parts as tokens.\n   d. Else, proceed to check two-character option.\n4. If two-character option exists, split and add.\n5. Else, treat as non-option.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after stripping, if the option isn't found, it checks if the first two characters form an option. So perhaps the new logic should be inserted in that else block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing else block.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\nOriginal code:\n\nif (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n    tokens.add(arg);\n} else {\n    if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n        // split into -D and property=value\n    } else {\n        eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n        tokens.add(arg);\n    }\n}\n\nSo in the else block, when the stripped opt isn't found, it checks for two-character options.\n\nBut in the case where the argument is --foo=bar, the stripped opt is 'foo', which may not exist. Then it checks if the first two chars are an option, which would be '--', which is not an option. So it treats it as a non-option, which is wrong.\n\nSo the fix is to, in the else block, before checking for two-character options, check if the argument contains '='. If so, split into parts and see if the first part is an option.\n\nSo the modified code would be:\n\nelse {\n    if (arg.contains(\"=\")) {\n        String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2); // Split into two parts\n        String optPart = parts[0];\n        if (options.hasOption(optPart)) {\n            tokens.add(optPart);\n            tokens.add(parts[1]);\n        } else {\n            // Maybe check if the two-character version exists?\n            // Or proceed as before\n            if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where the argument is like -Dproperty=value, the original code splits it into -D and property=value. So in the new code, when the argument is -Dproperty=value, the split on '=' would give parts[0] as -Dproperty and parts[1] as value. But -Dproperty isn't an option, so it would go to the else, and then check if the first two chars are an option, which is -D, which is an option. So it would split into -D and property=value, which is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because in the new code, when the argument is -Dproperty=value, the code would split into parts[0] = -Dproperty, parts[1] = value. Then check if options has -Dproperty, which it doesn't. So it would go to the else, and then check if the first two chars (arg.substring(0,2)) is an option. Since arg is -Dproperty=value, substring(0,2) is -D, which is an option. So it would split into -D and property=value, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the new code, after splitting on '=', we have parts[0] as the option part. So for -Dproperty=value, parts[0] is -Dproperty, which is not an option. So the code would then check if the first two characters (arg's first two) are an option. Which is -D, which is an option. So it would split into -D and the rest, which is correct.\n\nBut in the case where the argument is --foo=bar, the code would split into --foo and bar. Then check if --foo is an option. If yes, add both. If not, then check if the first two chars are an option, which is '--', which is not an option, so it would treat it as a non-option, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because in the case of --foo=bar, the code would split into parts[0] = --foo, parts[1] = bar. Then check if options has --foo. If it does, then tokens add --foo and bar. If not, then proceed to check if the first two chars of the original arg are an option. The original arg is --foo=bar, so substring(0,2) is '--', which is not an option. So it would treat it as a non-option, which is wrong.\n\nWait, but in the original code, when the argument is --foo, it's handled correctly because options.hasOption(opt) would be true. But when it's --foo=bar, the opt is 'foo', which may not exist, leading to the else block.\n\nSo the problem is that in the else block, the code doesn't handle the case where the option is like --foo=bar. So the fix is to, in the else block, check if the argument contains '=', split it, and check if the first part is an option.\n\nSo perhaps the code should be restructured as follows:\n\nIn the else block:\n\nif (arg contains '=') {\n    split into parts.\n    if parts[0] is an option, add both.\n    else, check if the first two chars are an option, and split.\n} else {\n    check if first two chars are an option.\n}\n\nWait, but that might not cover all cases. Alternatively, perhaps the code should first check for the presence of '=' and handle that case before checking for two-character options.\n\nSo, in the else block:\n\nif (arg.contains(\"=\")) {\n    String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n    String opt = parts[0];\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(opt);\n        tokens.add(parts[1]);\n    } else {\n        // Maybe the opt is something like -D, so check if the first two chars are an option.\n        String twoCharOpt = arg.substring(0, 2);\n        if (options.hasOption(twoCharOpt)) {\n            tokens.add(twoCharOpt);\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // existing logic for two-character options\n    if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n        tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n        tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n    } else {\n        eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n        tokens.add(arg);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where the argument is -Dproperty=value, the code would split into parts[0] = -Dproperty, which is not an option. Then it would check if the first two chars are an option, which is -D, which is an option. So it would split into -D and property=value, which is correct.\n\nIn the case where the argument is --foo=bar, the code would split into --foo and bar. If --foo is an option, it's added correctly. If not, it would check if the first two chars are an option, which is '--', which is not. So it would treat it as a non-option, which is wrong.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the argument --foo=bar would have opt = 'foo', which may not be an option. So it would go to the else block, check if the first two chars are an option, which is '--', which is not. So it would treat it as a non-option.\n\nBut in reality, --foo is the option, and it's being passed as --foo=bar. So the code should split into --foo and bar.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is not sufficient. Maybe the code should first check if the argument starts with '--' or '-' and then check for '='.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be restructured to handle the case where the argument is an option with a value, regardless of whether it's a long or short option.\n\nAnother approach: when the argument starts with '-', check if it contains '='. If so, split into option and value. Then check if the option part is a valid option. If yes, add both. Otherwise, proceed as before.\n\nSo, in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\nString opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n\nif (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n    tokens.add(arg);\n} else {\n    if (arg.contains(\"=\")) {\n        String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n        String possibleOpt = parts[0];\n        if (options.hasOption(possibleOpt)) {\n            tokens.add(possibleOpt);\n            tokens.add(parts[1]);\n        } else {\n            // Check if the two-character version is an option\n            if (arg.length() >= 2 && options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Check two-character option\n        if (arg.length() >= 2 && options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, for an argument like --foo=bar, the opt is 'foo', which may not be an option. So it goes into the else block, checks if the argument contains '=', which it does. Splits into parts[0] = --foo, parts[1] = bar. Then checks if options has --foo. If yes, adds both. If not, then checks if the first two chars are an option, which is '--', which is not. So it treats it as a non-option, which is wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that the code is stripping leading hyphens, but in the case of --foo=bar, the stripped opt is 'foo', which may not be an option, but the actual option is --foo.\n\nSo the initial approach of stripping leading hyphens is causing the problem. Because when the argument is --foo=bar, stripping leading hyphens gives 'foo', which is not the actual option name, which is 'foo' but as a long option.\n\nWait, no. The options are defined with their names, so if the option is defined as 'foo', then --foo is the long form. So in the code, when the argument is --foo=bar, the opt becomes 'foo', and options.hasOption('foo') should return true if 'foo' is defined as an option.\n\nWait, that's correct. So if the option is defined as 'foo', then when the argument is --foo=bar, the opt is 'foo', which is found, so tokens.add(arg) is called, which adds the entire string. But that's not correct because we need to split into --foo and bar.\n\nWait, no. Because in the original code, when the argument is --foo, it's handled correctly. But when it's --foo=bar, the code treats it as a single token, which is incorrect.\n\nSo the problem is that the code doesn't split the option and value when the argument is in the form --foo=bar.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach of checking for '=' in the else block is not sufficient because the code is adding the entire argument as a token when the stripped opt is found.\n\nWait, in the original code, if the stripped opt is found, it adds the entire argument as a token. So for --foo=bar, the opt is 'foo', which is found, so it adds the entire argument as a single token. But that's wrong because it should be split into --foo and bar.\n\nSo the fix is to, when the argument contains '=', split it into option and value, regardless of whether the stripped opt is found or not.\n\nSo perhaps the code should first check if the argument contains '=' and handle that case before checking if the stripped opt is an option.\n\nSo, reorganizing the code:\n\nIn the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\nif (arg.contains(\"=\")) {\n    String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n    String optPart = parts[0];\n    if (options.hasOption(optPart)) {\n        tokens.add(optPart);\n        tokens.add(parts[1]);\n    } else {\n        // Check if the two-character version is an option\n        if (arg.length() >= 2 && options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(arg);\n    } else {\n        if (arg.length() >= 2 && options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this way, for an argument like --foo=bar, the code would split into --foo and bar, and check if --foo is an option. If yes, add both. If not, check if the first two chars are an option.\n\nBut in the case where the option is defined as 'foo', the code would split into --foo and bar, and check if --foo is an option, which it's not. So it would proceed to check if the first two chars are an option, which is '--', which is not. So it would treat it as a non-option, which is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Because if the option is defined as 'foo', then the argument --foo=bar should be treated as the option 'foo' with value 'bar'. So the code should split into --foo and bar, but since the option is 'foo', not '--foo', the code would not find it in the options, leading to the else block.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is that the code is using Util.stripLeadingHyphens, which removes all leading hyphens, turning --foo into 'foo'. So when the argument is --foo=bar, the code would split into --foo and bar, and check if --foo is an option. If not, it would check if the first two chars are an option, which is '--', which is not. So it would treat it as a non-option.\n\nBut in reality, the option is 'foo', so the code should recognize that --foo is the option, and 'bar' is the value.\n\nSo perhaps the code should not split on '=' when the argument is in the form --foo=bar, but instead treat --foo as the option and 'bar' as the value.\n\nWait, but how can the code know that? Because the option is defined as 'foo', so when the argument is --foo=bar, the code should recognize that the option is 'foo' and the value is 'bar'.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach of splitting on '=' is not sufficient because it's treating the option part as the entire string before '=', which may include the hyphens.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to first check if the argument starts with '--' or '-', and then check if it contains '='. If so, split into option and value, where the option is the part before '=', and then check if that option exists.\n\nBut in the case of --foo=bar, the option is 'foo', so the code should split into --foo and bar, but the option 'foo' exists, so it should add both tokens.\n\nWait, but in the code, when we split on '=', the first part is --foo, which is not the option name 'foo'. So the code would not find it, leading to the else block.\n\nSo perhaps the code should strip the hyphens from the option part after splitting.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So after splitting on '=', take the first part, strip the hyphens, and check if that's an option.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (arg.contains(\"=\")) {\n    String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n    String optPart = parts[0];\n    String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(optPart);\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(optPart); // Or should it be the stripped version?\n        tokens.add(parts[1]);\n    } else {\n        // Check two-character option\n        if (arg.length() >= 2 && options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but then for --foo=bar, the optPart is --foo, stripping gives 'foo', which is an option. So the code would add --foo and bar as tokens. But the option is 'foo', so when the parser sees --foo, it's the same as the option 'foo'.\n\nWait, but in the tokens, adding --foo and bar would correctly represent the option and value. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the original code, when the argument is --foo, it's added as a single token, which is correct. So when the argument is --foo=bar, it's split into --foo and bar, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps this approach would fix the issue.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nIn the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\n1. Check if the argument contains '='.\n2. If yes, split into two parts: optPart and value.\n3. Strip the hyphens from optPart to get opt.\n4. If opt is a valid option, add optPart and value as tokens.\n5. Else, check if the first two characters of the original arg form a valid option.\n6. If yes, split into two-character option and the rest.\n7. Else, treat as non-option.\n\nWait, but in step 4, adding optPart (e.g., --foo) and value (bar) would correctly represent the option and its value. So the parser would recognize --foo as the option 'foo' with value 'bar'.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo integrating this into the code:\n\nIn the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\nif (arg.contains(\"=\")) {\n    String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n    String optPart = parts[0];\n    String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(optPart);\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(optPart);\n        tokens.add(parts[1]);\n    } else {\n        // Check two-character option\n        if (arg.length() >= 2) {\n            String twoCharOpt = arg.substring(0, 2);\n            if (options.hasOption(twoCharOpt)) {\n                tokens.add(twoCharOpt);\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(arg);\n    } else {\n        if (arg.length() >= 2) {\n            String twoCharOpt = arg.substring(0, 2);\n            if (options.hasOption(twoCharOpt)) {\n                tokens.add(twoCharOpt);\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, when the argument is --foo=bar, it's split into --foo and bar, and since 'foo' is an option, it's added correctly.\n\nTesting another case: -Dproperty=value.\n\nThe argument starts with '-', contains '='. Split into -Dproperty and value. optPart is -Dproperty, stripping gives Dproperty. If Dproperty is not an option, then check if the first two chars are an option. The first two chars are -D, which is an option. So it's split into -D and property=value, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: -p=value (short option with value). The argument is -p=value. It's split into -p and value. opt is p, which is an option. So tokens are -p and value.\n\nAnother case: --unknown-option=value. If unknown-option is not defined, then it's treated as a non-option.\n\nSo this should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, I'll modify the original code accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```java\nprotected String[] flatten(Options options, String[] arguments, boolean stopAtNonOption) {\n    List tokens = new ArrayList();\n\n    boolean eatTheRest = false;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {\n        String arg = arguments[i];\n\n        if (\"--\".equals(arg)) {\n            eatTheRest = true;\n            tokens.add(\"--\");\n        } else if (\"-\".equals(arg)) {\n            tokens.add(\"-\");\n        } else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) {",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the flatten method. The problem is that when an option has a value, like --foo=bar, the method doesn't split it correctly. So it treats the whole string as the option, which isn't recognized, causing an exception.\n\nLooking at the original code, when an argument starts with a hyphen, it strips the hyphens to get the option name. If the option exists, it adds the arg as is. But if not, it checks if the first two characters are a valid option. If so, it splits the argument into the option part and the rest. But this approach might not handle cases where the option has an equals sign correctly.\n\nThe suggestion is to use a regular expression to match options with values. The pattern \"^--?([^=]+)=(.*)$\" should capture the option and value. So I'll modify the code to use this regex.\n\nI'll add the regex check right after checking if the argument starts with a hyphen. If the regex matches, extract the option and value. Then, check if the option exists in the options. If it does, add the option and value as separate tokens. Otherwise, maybe treat it as an unrecognized option.\n\nWait, in the original code, when the option isn't found, it sometimes adds the arg as is. So in the regex case, if the option isn't recognized, I should probably add the entire arg to tokens and stop processing further if stopAtNonOption is true.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each argument, check if it starts with '-'.\n2. Use the regex to see if it's in the form --option=value or -option=value.\n3. If it matches, extract option and value.\n4. Check if the option exists in the options.\n   a. If yes, add the option and value to tokens.\n   b. If no, add the entire arg and set eatTheRest if needed.\n5. If it doesn't match the regex, proceed with the original logic.\n\nI need to integrate this into the existing code without disrupting other parts. So in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block, I'll first try the regex. If it matches, handle accordingly. Else, proceed as before.\n\nWait, in the original code, after stripping hyphens, it checks if the option exists. If not, it checks if the first two characters are an option, which is for cases like -Dproperty=value. But with the regex approach, maybe that's handled differently.\n\nHmm, perhaps the regex can cover both cases. Let me test the regex:\n\nFor \"--foo=bar\", group1 is \"foo\", group2 is \"bar\".\nFor \"-Dproperty=value\", group1 is \"Dproperty\", group2 is \"value\". Wait, that's not right. Because the regex is looking for --? followed by something without an equals, then =, then the rest.\n\nWait, no. The regex is ^--?([^=]+)=(.*)$. So for \"-Dproperty=value\", the match would be: group1 is \"Dproperty\", group2 is \"value\". But in the original code, \"-Dproperty=value\" is split into \"-D\" and \"property=value\". So the regex approach would treat \"Dproperty\" as the option, which may not be correct.\n\nSo perhaps the regex approach needs to be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe the original code's handling of -D is a special case that I shouldn't interfere with.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be modified to handle both cases. Or maybe the original code's logic for -D can be kept alongside the regex handling.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's logic for handling -D is a separate case. So in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block, after stripping the hyphens, if the option doesn't exist, it checks if the first two characters are an option. So for \"-Dproperty=value\", the first two are \"-D\", which is an option, so it splits into \"-D\" and \"property=value\".\n\nSo in the regex approach, I need to make sure that this case is handled. Maybe the regex can be adjusted to capture the option correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be used first. If it matches, process as option=value. Else, proceed with the original logic.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInside else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")):\n\n- Check if the argument matches the regex pattern.\n- If yes, extract option and value.\n   - If option exists, add both to tokens.\n   - Else, add the entire arg and set eatTheRest.\n- Else, proceed with the original logic (strip hyphens, check options, etc.)\n\nWait, but the original code's else clause after checking options.hasOption(opt) is:\n\nif (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n    tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n    tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n} else {\n    eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n    tokens.add(arg);\n}\n\nSo that's for cases where the option is two characters, like -D.\n\nSo perhaps the regex approach can be used before that. So the flow would be:\n\nFor each argument starting with '-':\n   Try to match the regex for option=value.\n   If matches:\n      extract option and value.\n      if option exists:\n          add option and value.\n      else:\n          add arg, set eatTheRest.\n   else:\n      proceed with original logic.\n\nWait, but the regex may not match for cases like -Dproperty=value, because the option part is Dproperty, which is longer than two characters. So the regex would not split it correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps the regex approach is better suited for options that are followed by =, but the original code handles the -D case differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be modified to capture cases where the option is either --option or -option, and then an equals sign.\n\nWait, the regex pattern is \"^--?([^=]+)=(.*)$\". So it matches strings that start with -- or -, followed by some characters until an equals sign, then the rest.\n\nSo for \"-Dproperty=value\", the regex would match: group1 is \"Dproperty\", group2 is \"value\". But in the original code, this is treated as the option \"-D\" and the value \"property=value\".\n\nSo the regex approach would incorrectly split this into option \"Dproperty\" and value \"value\", which is not correct.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the regex approach isn't suitable for the -D case. So I need to find a way to handle both cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's logic for handling -D can be kept, and the regex can be used for other cases where the option is followed by =.\n\nWait, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture the option correctly. For example, in the case of -Dproperty=value, the option is \"-D\", and the value is \"property=value\".\n\nSo the regex should capture the option as \"-D\" and the value as \"property=value\".\n\nBut the current regex doesn't do that. It captures the part before the equals as the option, which in this case is \"Dproperty\", which is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the regex needs to be adjusted to account for the possibility that the option may be just the first two characters, like -D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be split into two parts: one for options with -- and one for single -.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to first check if the argument starts with \"--\" and then has an equals, or starts with \"-\" and has an equals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be modified to capture the option correctly, considering that the option may be either one or two characters after the hyphen(s).\n\nWait, perhaps the regex can be written as \"^(-+)([^=]+)=(.*)$\", but that might not be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be broken down into two cases: one for options starting with -- and one with -.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be written as \"^--([^=]+)=(.*)$\" and \"^-(.)=(.*)$\". But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be written to capture the option part correctly, whether it's a single hyphen or double.\n\nWait, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture the option as the part after the hyphens but before the equals. So for \"--foo=bar\", the option is \"foo\"; for \"-Dproperty=value\", the option is \"Dproperty\". But that's not correct because in the original code, \"-Dproperty=value\" is treated as option \"-D\" and value \"property=value\".\n\nSo perhaps the regex approach isn't suitable for that case, and I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code's logic can be modified to handle the equals case before checking for the two-character option.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to first check if the argument contains an equals sign. If it does, split into option and value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured as follows:\n\nWhen an argument starts with '-', check if it contains an '='. If yes, split into option and value. Else, proceed as before.\n\nSo in code:\n\nelse if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) {\n    if (arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n        // Handle option=value case\n        String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n        String opt = parts[0].replaceFirst(\"^-+\", \"\"); // Remove leading hyphens\n        if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n            tokens.add(parts[0]);\n            tokens.add(parts[1]);\n        } else {\n            // Check if the option is two characters, like -D\n            if (parts[0].length() == 2 && options.hasOption(parts[0])) {\n                tokens.add(parts[0]);\n                tokens.add(parts[1]);\n            } else {\n                tokens.add(arg);\n                if (stopAtNonOption) eatTheRest = true;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Proceed with original logic\n        String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n        if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        } else {\n            if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, an argument like \"--foo=bar\" would split into \"--foo\" and \"bar\", but the option is \"foo\", so we need to check if \"foo\" exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified to split the argument into the option part and the value, then check if the option exists.\n\nSo, in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\nCheck if the argument contains '='. If yes, split into two parts: the option part (including hyphens) and the value.\n\nThen, extract the option name by stripping the hyphens from the option part.\n\nIf the option exists, add the option part and the value as separate tokens.\n\nElse, check if the option part is a valid two-character option (like -D). If yes, split and add.\n\nElse, add the entire argument.\n\nWait, but this might complicate things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be used, but after extracting the option, I need to check if it's a valid option, considering both the stripped version and the two-character version.\n\nWait, perhaps the regex approach is better. Let me try to adjust the regex.\n\nThe regex pattern \"^--?([^=]+)=(.*)$\" will match any string that starts with -- or -, followed by some characters, then =, then the rest.\n\nSo for \"--foo=bar\", group1 is \"foo\", group2 is \"bar\".\n\nFor \"-Dproperty=value\", group1 is \"Dproperty\", group2 is \"value\".\n\nBut in the original code, \"-Dproperty=value\" is split into \"-D\" and \"property=value\".\n\nSo the regex approach would treat \"Dproperty\" as the option, which is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the regex isn't suitable for this case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code's logic for handling -D is a special case that needs to be preserved. So I can't just replace it with the regex approach.\n\nSo maybe I should first check if the argument starts with --, then use the regex. Else, check if it's a single -, and then see if it's in the form -option=value.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be restructured as follows:\n\nIn the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\n1. If the argument starts with \"--\", use the regex to split into option and value.\n2. Else, check if the argument contains '=':\n   a. If yes, split into option part and value. The option part is the part before '=', which starts with '-'.\n   b. Strip the hyphens from the option part to get the option name.\n   c. Check if the option exists. If yes, add the option part and value.\n   d. Else, check if the option part is a valid two-character option (like -D). If yes, split and add.\n   e. Else, add the entire argument.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified to handle the case where the argument has an equals sign, regardless of whether it's -- or -.\n\nSo, in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\nCheck if the argument contains '='. If yes, split into optionPart and value.\n\nThen, extract the option name by stripping the hyphens from optionPart.\n\nIf the option exists, add optionPart and value as tokens.\n\nElse, check if optionPart is a valid two-character option (like -D). If yes, add it and the rest.\n\nElse, add the entire argument.\n\nWait, but how to split the argument into optionPart and value.\n\nFor example, in \"--foo=bar\", optionPart is \"--foo\", value is \"bar\".\n\nIn \"-Dproperty=value\", optionPart is \"-Dproperty\", value is \"value\".\n\nBut in the original code, \"-Dproperty=value\" is split into \"-D\" and \"property=value\".\n\nSo perhaps the approach of splitting on the first '=' isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified to check if the argument starts with '--' and then has an '=', in which case split into option and value.\n\nElse, if it starts with '-', check if it has an '=' and the part before '=' is a valid option.\n\nWait, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture the option correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified to first check for the -- case, then for the - case.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\nInside else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")):\n\n- If the argument starts with \"--\":\n   - Use the regex to split into option and value.\n   - If option exists, add both.\n   - Else, add the entire arg.\n- Else (starts with \"-\"):\n   - Check if the argument contains '='.\n   - If yes:\n      - Split into optionPart and value at the first '='.\n      - Strip hyphens from optionPart to get opt.\n      - If options.hasOption(opt):\n          tokens.add(optionPart);\n          tokens.add(value);\n      - Else:\n          Check if optionPart is a valid two-character option (like -D).\n          If yes:\n              tokens.add(optionPart);\n              tokens.add(value);\n          Else:\n              tokens.add(arg);\n              if stopAtNonOption, set eatTheRest.\n   - Else:\n      Proceed with original logic.\n\nWait, but in the case of \"-Dproperty=value\", optionPart is \"-Dproperty\", which when stripped becomes \"Dproperty\". If that's not an option, then check if optionPart is a two-character option, which it's not because it's longer than two characters. So it would add the entire arg, which is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first check if the argument starts with \"--\" and has an '=', then handle that case. For arguments starting with '-', check if they have an '=' and are in the form -option=value, where option is a single word.\n\nWait, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture the option correctly for both cases.\n\nAnother approach: Split the argument into tokens whenever an '=' is present, but only if the part before '=' is a valid option.\n\nSo, for any argument starting with '-', check if it contains '='. If yes, split into optionPart and value.\n\nThen, check if the optionPart (without hyphens) is a valid option. If yes, add optionPart and value.\n\nElse, check if the optionPart is a valid two-character option (like -D). If yes, split and add.\n\nElse, add the entire argument.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nInside else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")):\n\nif (arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n    String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n    String optionPart = parts[0];\n    String value = parts[1];\n    String opt = optionPart.replaceFirst(\"^-+\", \"\"); // Strip leading hyphens\n\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(optionPart);\n        tokens.add(value);\n    } else {\n        // Check if optionPart is a two-character option\n        if (optionPart.length() == 2 && options.hasOption(optionPart)) {\n            tokens.add(optionPart);\n            tokens.add(value);\n        } else {\n            tokens.add(arg);\n            if (stopAtNonOption) eatTheRest = true;\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // Proceed with original logic\n    String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n    if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n        tokens.add(arg);\n    } else {\n        if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n            tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n        } else {\n            eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, let's test this logic with some examples.\n\nExample 1: \"--foo=bar\"\n\n- starts with \"--\", has '='.\n- parts[0] = \"--foo\", parts[1] = \"bar\".\n- opt = \"foo\".\n- if options has \"foo\", add \"--foo\" and \"bar\".\n\nExample 2: \"-Dproperty=value\"\n\n- starts with '-', has '='.\n- parts[0] = \"-Dproperty\", parts[1] = \"value\".\n- opt = \"Dproperty\".\n- if \"Dproperty\" is not an option, check if optionPart is two chars: \"-Dproperty\" is longer than two, so no.\n- add the entire arg \"-Dproperty=value\".\n\nBut in the original code, \"-Dproperty=value\" is split into \"-D\" and \"property=value\". So this approach doesn't handle that case correctly.\n\nSo perhaps this approach isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first check if the argument is in the form of \"-Dkey=value\", which is a special case in Java's system properties.\n\nSo perhaps the code can first check if the argument starts with \"-D\" and has an '='. If so, split into \"-D\" and \"key=value\".\n\nElse, proceed with the regex approach.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nelse if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) {\n    if (arg.startsWith(\"-D\") && arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n        // Handle -Dkey=value case\n        String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n        tokens.add(\"-D\");\n        tokens.add(parts[1]);\n    } else if (arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n        // Handle other cases like --option=value\n        String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n        String optionPart = parts[0];\n        String opt = optionPart.replaceFirst(\"^-+\", \"\");\n        if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n            tokens.add(optionPart);\n            tokens.add(parts[1]);\n        } else {\n            tokens.add(arg);\n            if (stopAtNonOption) eatTheRest = true;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Proceed with original logic\n        String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n        if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        } else {\n            if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, the -D case is handled first, then other cases with '=' are handled with the split.\n\nTesting this:\n\nExample 1: \"--foo=bar\" \u2192 split into \"--foo\" and \"bar\". If \"foo\" is an option, added correctly.\n\nExample 2: \"-Dproperty=value\" \u2192 split into \"-D\" and \"property=value\".\n\nExample 3: \"-foo=bar\" \u2192 split into \"-foo\" and \"bar\". If \"foo\" is an option, added.\n\nThis seems better.\n\nSo, integrating this into the code.\n\nSo, in the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block, first check if it's a -D case with '='. If yes, split into \"-D\" and the rest.\n\nElse, check if there's an '='. If yes, split into optionPart and value, then check if the option exists.\n\nElse, proceed with the original logic.\n\nI think this should handle the cases correctly.\n\nSo, the modified code would have this structure.\n\nNow, let me write the code accordingly.\n\nIn the else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) block:\n\nif (arg starts with \"-D\" and contains '=') \u2192 handle as -D case.\n\nelse if (arg contains '=') \u2192 split into optionPart and value, check option.\n\nelse \u2192 original logic.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nelse if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) {\n    if (arg.startsWith(\"-D\") && arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n        String valuePart = arg.substring(arg.indexOf('=') + 1);\n        tokens.add(\"-D\");\n        tokens.add(valuePart);\n    } else if (arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n        String[] parts = arg.split(\"=\", 2);\n        String optionPart = parts[0];\n        String opt = optionPart.replaceFirst(\"^-+\", \"\");\n        if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n            tokens.add(optionPart);\n            tokens.add(parts[1]);\n        } else {\n            tokens.add(arg);\n            if (stopAtNonOption) {\n                eatTheRest = true;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        String opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(arg);\n        if (options.hasOption(opt)) {\n            tokens.add(arg);\n        } else {\n            if (options.hasOption(arg.substring(0, 2))) {\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(0, 2));\n                tokens.add(arg.substring(2));\n            } else {\n                eatTheRest = stopAtNonOption;\n                tokens.add(arg);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the -D case, the code adds \"-D\" and the value part, which is everything after '='. So for \"-Dproperty=value\", it adds \"-D\" and \"property=value\", which is correct.\n\nIn the other cases, like \"--foo=bar\", it splits into \"--foo\" and \"bar\", and checks if \"foo\" is an option.\n\nIf the option exists, it's added correctly. If not, the entire arg is added.\n\nThis should fix the issue where options with values were not being split correctly.\n\nI think this should handle both the --option=value and -Dproperty=value cases correctly.\n\nSo, the final code would incorporate this logic.\n</think>\n\n```java\nprotected String[] flatten(Options options, String[] arguments, boolean stopAtNonOption) {\n    List tokens = new ArrayList();\n\n    boolean eatTheRest = false;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {\n        String arg = arguments[i];\n\n        if (\"--\".equals(arg)) {\n            eatTheRest = true;\n            tokens.add(\"--\");\n        } else if (\"-\".equals(arg)) {\n            tokens.add(\"-\");\n        } else if (arg.startsWith(\"-\")) {\n            if (arg.startsWith(\"-D\") && arg.indexOf('=') != -1) {\n                String valuePart = arg.substring(arg.indexOf('=') + 1);\n                tokens.add(\"-D\");\n                tokens.add",
