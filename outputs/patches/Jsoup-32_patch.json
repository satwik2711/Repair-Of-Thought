      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `clone()` method is not creating a deep copy of the class names. Instead, it is creating a shallow copy, which means that both the original and cloned objects are referencing the same `classNames` set. When the cloned object's class names are modified, the original object's class names are also modified, causing the test to fail.\nSuggestion: Create a Deep Copy of Class Names\nWe can create a deep copy of the class names by using the `new HashSet<>()` constructor to create a new `classNames` set in the cloned object, and then copying the class names from the original object's `classNames` set to the new set using the `addAll()` method. This approach ensures that the cloned object has its own independent set of class names, which can be modified without affecting the original object.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames = new HashSet<>(classNames);\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames();\n    return clone;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

When the cloned object's class names are modified, the original object's class names are also modified, causing the test to fail.\nSuggestion: Use a Copy Constructor\nAlternatively, we can use a copy constructor to create a deep copy of the class names. We can create a new `Element` object and pass the original object's `classNames` set to the constructor, which will create a deep copy of the class names. This approach is more explicit and can be more efficient than creating a new set and copying the elements.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = new Element(this);\n    return clone;\n}\n\n// Assuming a copy constructor is defined in the Element class\npublic Element(Element original) {\n    this.classNames = new HashSet<>(original.classNames);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames();\n    return clone;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When the cloned object's class names are modified, the original object's class names are also modified, causing the test to fail.\nSuggestion: Use a Defensive Copy\nAnother approach is to use a defensive copy to create a deep copy of the class names. We can create a new `classNames` set in the cloned object and copy the class names from the original object's `classNames` set to the new set using the `addAll()` method. However, instead of using the `new HashSet<>()` constructor, we can use the `Collections.unmodifiableSet()` method to create an unmodifiable set, which ensures that the cloned object's class names cannot be modified accidentally.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames = Collections.unmodifiableSet(new HashSet<>(classNames));\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames();\n    return clone;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
