Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `isDirectory()` function returns true for directory names that end in a slash, but the `TarArchiveInputStream` class does not expect this. When `getNextTarEntry()` is called, it expects the next entry to be a file, not a directory. This causes the `TarArchiveInputStream` to throw an `IOException` when it encounters a directory name that ends in a slash.\nSuggestion: Modify isDirectory() to Return False for Directory Names Ending in Slash\nOne potential fix is to modify the `isDirectory()` function to return false for directory names that end in a slash. This would ensure that the `TarArchiveInputStream` class does not throw an `IOException` when it encounters a directory name that ends in a slash. Here is an example of how the modified `isDirectory()` function could look:\n```java\npublic boolean isDirectory() {\n    if (file != null) {\n        return file.isDirectory();\n    }\n\n    if (linkFlag == LF_DIR) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    if (getName().endsWith(\"/\")) {\n        return false; // Return false for directory names ending in slash\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean isDirectory() {\n    if (file != null) {\n        return file.isDirectory();\n    }\n\n    if (linkFlag == LF_DIR) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    if (getName().endsWith(\"/\")) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This causes the `TarArchiveInputStream` to throw an `IOException` when it encounters a directory name that ends in a slash.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Method to Check if Entry is a Directory\nA second potential fix is to use a different method to check if an entry is a directory. For example, we could use the `getName()` method to get the name of the entry and then check if it ends in a slash. If it does, we could return false. Here is an example of how the modified `isDirectory()` function could look:\n```java\npublic boolean isDirectory() {\n    String name = getName();\n    if (name != null && name.endsWith(\"/\")) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    if (file != null) {\n        return file.isDirectory();\n    }\n\n    if (linkFlag == LF_DIR) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic boolean isDirectory() {\n    if (file != null) {\n        return file.isDirectory();\n    }\n\n    if (linkFlag == LF_DIR) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    if (getName().endsWith(\"/\")) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This would prevent the `TarArchiveInputStream` class from throwing an `IOException` when it encounters a directory name that ends in a slash.
