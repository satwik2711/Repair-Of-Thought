      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue arises from the fact that the `URL` class in Java does not handle URLs with query parameters correctly when resolving relative URLs. Specifically, when a relative URL with a query parameter is resolved against a base URL, the query parameter is not correctly appended to the resulting absolute URL.\nSuggestion: Manual Query Parameter Handling\nOne possible solution is to manually handle the query parameter when resolving the relative URL. We can do this by parsing the query parameter from the relative URL and then appending it to the resulting absolute URL. This would involve modifying the `absUrl` function to parse the query parameter and then append it to the resulting URL. Here's an example of how the modified function could look:\n\n```java\npublic String absUrl(String attributeKey) {\n    Validate.notEmpty(attributeKey);\n\n    String relUrl = attr(attributeKey);\n    if (!hasAttr(attributeKey)) {\n        return \"\"; // nothing to make absolute with\n    } else {\n        URL base;\n        try {\n            try {\n                base = new URL(baseUri);\n            } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n                // the base is unsuitable, but the attribute may be abs on its own, so try that\n                URL abs = new URL(relUrl);\n                return abs.toExternalForm();\n            }\n            // workaround: java resolves '//path/file + ?foo' to '//path/?foo', not '//path/file?foo' as desired\n            URL abs = new URL(base, relUrl);\n            String query = abs.getQuery();\n            if (query == null) {\n                query = \"\";\n            }\n            String path = abs.getPath();\n            if (path == null) {\n                path = \"\";\n            }\n            String absoluteUrl = base.getProtocol() + \"://\" + base.getHost() + path + \"?\" + query;\n            return absoluteUrl;\n        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n            return \"\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic String absUrl(String attributeKey) {\n    Validate.notEmpty(attributeKey);\n\n    String relUrl = attr(attributeKey);\n    if (!hasAttr(attributeKey)) {\n        return \"\"; // nothing to make absolute with\n    } else {\n        URL base;\n        try {\n            try {\n                base = new URL(baseUri);\n            } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n                // the base is unsuitable, but the attribute may be abs on its own, so try that\n                URL abs = new URL(relUrl);\n                return abs.toExternalForm();\n            }\n            // workaround: java resolves '//path/file + ?foo' to '//path/?foo', not '//path/file?foo' as desired\n            URL abs = new URL(base, relUrl);\n            return abs.toExternalForm();\n        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n            return \"\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Specifically, when a relative URL with a query parameter is resolved against a base URL, the query parameter is not correctly appended to the resulting absolute URL.\nSuggestion: Using a URL Parsing Library\nA third possible solution is to use a URL parsing library, such as the `java.net.URI` class or a third-party library like Apache Commons URI, to handle the URL resolution.
