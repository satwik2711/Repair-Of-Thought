      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue is caused by the `trim()` method called on the result of `accum.toString()` in the `html()` function. The `trim()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace characters from the string, which is not the expected behavior in this case. The `html()` function is supposed to return the inner HTML of the element, including any whitespace characters.\nSuggestion: Remove the `trim()` method\nThe simplest fix would be to remove the `trim()` method from the `html()` function. This would ensure that the function returns the inner HTML of the element, including any whitespace characters. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic String html() {\n    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();\n    html(accum);\n    return accum.toString();\n}\n```\nThis fix is straightforward and efficient, and it fixes the issue without adding unnecessary complexity.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String html() {\n    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();\n    html(accum);\n    return accum.toString().trim();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The `trim()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace characters from the string, which is not the expected behavior in this case. The `html()` function is supposed to return the inner HTML of the element, including any whitespace characters.\nSuggestion: Use a custom whitespace-preservation method\nIf we want to preserve the whitespace characters but still remove any unnecessary whitespace, we could create a custom method that does this. For example, we could use a regular expression to replace multiple whitespace characters with a single space. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic String html() {\n    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();\n    html(accum);\n    return accum.toString().replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \" \");\n}\n```\nThis fix requires creating a custom method, which may add complexity, but it provides more control over the whitespace characters.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String html() {\n    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();\n    html(accum);\n    return accum.toString().trim();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The `html()` function is supposed to return the inner HTML of the element, including any whitespace characters.\nSuggestion: Modify the `StringBuilder` to preserve whitespace\nAnother approach would be to modify the `StringBuilder` to preserve whitespace characters. We could do this by using a custom `StringBuilder` implementation that does not trim whitespace characters. However, this approach is more complex and may not be feasible. A simpler alternative would be to use a `StringBuffer` instead of a `StringBuilder`, which preserves whitespace characters by default. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic String html() {\n    StringBuffer accum = new StringBuffer();\n    html(accum);\n    return accum.toString();\n}\n```\nThis fix requires modifying the `StringBuilder` implementation, which may not be feasible, but it provides a simple alternative using a `StringBuffer`.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String html() {\n    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();\n    html(accum);\n    return accum.toString().trim();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
