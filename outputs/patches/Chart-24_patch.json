      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue is with the calculation of the color parameter 'g' when the input value is outside the bounds. The calculation (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0) does not take into account the case when the input value is outside the bounds, resulting in a value of 'g' that is outside the valid range of 0-255.\nSuggestion: Clamp Input Value to Bounds\nClamp the input value to the bounds before calculating 'g'. This can be done by replacing the line 'int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);' with 'int g = (int) ((Math.max(this.lowerBound, Math.min(value, this.upperBound)) - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);'. This ensures that the input value is within the bounds before calculating 'g', preventing the calculation from resulting in a value outside the valid range.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Paint getPaint(double value) {\n    double v = Math.max(value, this.lowerBound);\n    v = Math.min(v, this.upperBound);\n    int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound \n            - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);\n    return new Color(g, g, g);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This can be done by replacing the line 'int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);' with 'int g = Math.max(0, Math.min(255, (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0)));'.

This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function and returning a default color if the input value is outside the bounds. For example, 'if (value < this.lowerBound) return Color.black; if (value > this.upperBound) return Color.white;'. This ensures that the function handles out-of-bounds values correctly, preventing the error from occurring.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Paint getPaint(double value) {\n    double v = Math.max(value, this.lowerBound);\n    v = Math.min(v, this.upperBound);\n    int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound \n            - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);\n    return new Color(g, g, g);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
