      "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this buggy function. Let me try to understand what's going on here. The function is called deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped, and it's part of a JSON deserialization process. The root cause of the issue is related to how creator properties are handled. \n\nFrom the context, I see that when a creator property is encountered, the method tries to build the bean using the creator and then processes the remaining properties. But if the creator property isn't the last one in the JSON object, the remaining properties aren't processed correctly, leading to null values, like for the 'name' object.\n\nThe suggestion is to reorder the creator properties so they are last. But if that's not possible because the JSON structure isn't under our control, we need another approach.\n\nLooking at the original code, when a creator property is found, it builds the bean immediately. Then, it tries to process the remaining fields by copying them into the tokens buffer. But maybe this approach misses some properties or doesn't handle them correctly.\n\nWait, in the original code, after building the bean, it enters a while loop that copies the remaining fields. But perhaps this isn't sufficient because the buffer might not capture all necessary properties, especially if the creator isn't the last property.\n\nSo, maybe the problem is that once the creator is called, the method assumes that all other properties have been processed, but that's not the case. The creator might be called before all properties are read, causing some to be ignored.\n\nI think the solution is to delay the building of the bean until all properties, including the creator ones, have been processed. Alternatively, ensure that all properties are read before invoking the creator.\n\nWait, but the creator might require certain properties to be set as parameters. So perhaps the creator should be called only after all properties are read. But that might not be feasible because the creator is used to construct the bean, which might be needed to set other properties.\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is that after calling creator.build(), the code assumes that all remaining properties are to be set on the bean. But if the creator property is not the last, the code might not correctly handle the remaining properties.\n\nLooking at the code, after building the bean, it does a while loop to copy the remaining fields. But perhaps this isn't correctly handling the case where the creator property is in the middle.\n\nWait, let me go through the code step by step.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a PropertyBasedCreator and a buffer. It then creates a TokenBuffer and writes the start object.\n\nIt loops through each field name. For each field, it checks if it's a creator property. If it is, it assigns the parameter to the buffer. If that's successful, it builds the bean, then copies the remaining structure into the tokens, and returns the processed unwrapped bean.\n\nBut the problem arises when the creator property isn't the last one. Because after building the bean, it tries to read the remaining fields, but perhaps the p.nextToken() isn't correctly positioned, or the loop doesn't capture all the fields.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\nt = p.nextToken();\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken();\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\nSo, after building the bean, it advances the token to the next one, which should be the value of the creator property. Then, for each field name, it copies the structure into tokens.\n\nBut maybe this misses some properties because the initial nextToken() after building the bean skips the value of the creator property, but the while loop starts at the next token, which could be FIELD_NAME or END_OBJECT.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. Suppose the JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"a\": 1,\n  \"creatorProp\": 2,\n  \"b\": 3\n}\n\nWhen the loop processes \"a\", it's a regular property. Then, when it processes \"creatorProp\", it's a creator property. It builds the bean, then the next token after that would be the value of \"creatorProp\", which is 2. Then, t is set to p.nextToken(), which would be FIELD_NAME for \"b\". So the while loop would process \"b\", copy it, and then t becomes END_OBJECT.\n\nSo in this case, it should capture \"b\" correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that when the creator property is not the last, the code doesn't process all the properties correctly. Or maybe the buffer isn't handling the properties properly.\n\nWait, another possibility: when the creator is called, it builds the bean, but any properties that come after the creator property are added to the tokens, which are then processed by the unwrapped handler. But perhaps the unwrapped handler isn't correctly setting those properties on the bean.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the buffer is not correctly capturing all the properties before the creator is called. Because the creator is called as soon as a creator property is found, which might be before all other properties are processed.\n\nWait, let's think about the order of processing. Suppose the JSON has a creator property in the middle. The code would process the creator property, build the bean, then process the remaining properties. But perhaps the buffer hasn't captured all the properties yet, leading to missing data.\n\nWait, no. Because before processing the creator property, the code would have already processed any previous properties and buffered them. So when the creator is built, it uses all the buffered properties, including the creator property. Then, the remaining properties are added to the tokens, which are then passed to the unwrapped handler.\n\nBut perhaps the unwrapped handler is not correctly applying those remaining properties to the bean. Or maybe the way the tokens are handled is causing some properties to be missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when the creator is built, the buffer is not fully populated with all the properties, leading to some being null.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the creator properties are being processed in the middle, and the remaining properties are being added to the tokens, but the unwrapped handler is not correctly merging them into the bean.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not build the bean until all properties are processed, but that might not be possible because the creator is needed to construct the bean, which is then used to set other properties.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the code should collect all the properties first, including the creator ones, and then build the bean once all are processed. But that might not be feasible because the creator might require certain properties to be set as parameters.\n\nWait, the creator is used to construct the bean, so perhaps the creator properties are the ones passed to the constructor or factory method. So, the creator properties are the parameters needed to create the bean. Once the bean is created, the other properties are set on it.\n\nSo, in the current code, when a creator property is found, it's added to the buffer, and if all required creator properties are present, the bean is built. Then, any remaining properties are processed and set on the bean.\n\nBut the problem arises when the creator property is not the last one. Because after building the bean, the code tries to process the remaining properties, but perhaps it's not correctly handling the case where the creator is in the middle.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that after building the bean, the code assumes that the remaining properties are all to be unwrapped, but the unwrapped handler might not be correctly handling them, leading to some properties not being set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buffer is not correctly capturing the creator properties, leading to the bean being built with incomplete data.\n\nWait, looking at the code, when a creator property is found, it's assigned to the buffer. If the assignment is successful (i.e., all required creator properties are assigned), then the bean is built. Then, the remaining properties are copied into the tokens buffer, which is then passed to the unwrapped handler.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the unwrapped handler is not correctly processing these remaining properties, leading to nulls.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the tokens are being copied is incorrect. For example, if the remaining properties are not correctly added to the tokens, the unwrapped handler doesn't see them.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\ntokens.writeEndObject();\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n\nSo, the tokens buffer contains the remaining properties. The processUnwrapped method should then apply these to the bean.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the case where the tokens have multiple properties, or perhaps it's not being called correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when the creator is built, the buffer is not fully populated with all the properties, leading to some being missed.\n\nWait, perhaps the buffer is being used to collect properties, and when the creator is built, it uses the buffer's data. But if the creator is built before all properties are processed, some properties are not yet in the buffer, leading to nulls.\n\nSo, maybe the solution is to ensure that all properties, including the creator ones, are collected before building the bean. But that might not be possible because the creator requires certain properties to be present as parameters.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to collect all the properties, including the creator ones, and then build the bean once all are processed. But that would require that the creator can be called after all properties are read, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the creator should be built only after all properties are processed, but that might not be feasible if the creator is needed to construct the bean, which is then used to set other properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is building the bean as soon as a creator property is found, but there might be multiple creator properties, and they need to be all processed before building the bean.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the creatorProp is found, and if the buffer.assignParameter is successful, it builds the bean. But assignParameter returns true only when all required parameters are assigned. So, perhaps the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nWait, but the problem arises when the creator property is not the last one. So, after building the bean, the code tries to process the remaining properties, but perhaps the way it's done is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the code again, after building the bean, it does:\n\nt = p.nextToken();\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken();\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\nSo, after building the bean, it reads the next token, which should be the value of the creator property. Then, for each FIELD_NAME, it copies the structure into tokens.\n\nBut perhaps this is causing the code to skip some properties. For example, if the next token after the creator's value is a FIELD_NAME, it processes it, but maybe the way the tokens are copied is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not be building the bean in the middle of processing properties, but rather wait until all properties are read.\n\nWait, but that might not be possible because the bean needs to be created before setting other properties on it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to separate the processing into two phases: first, collect all the properties, then build the bean, and then set the remaining properties.\n\nBut that might require significant changes to the code structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is returning immediately after processing the creator property, without allowing the rest of the properties to be processed in the main loop.\n\nWait, in the original code, after building the bean and processing the remaining properties, it returns the result of processUnwrapped. So, the function exits early, without going through the rest of the loop.\n\nBut perhaps this is causing some properties to be missed because the main loop is not allowed to process them.\n\nWait, no, because the code is in a loop that processes each FIELD_NAME. So, when a creator property is found, it builds the bean, processes the remaining properties, and returns. So, any properties after the creator are processed in that while loop.\n\nBut perhaps the way the tokens are being handled is incorrect, leading to the 'name' property being null.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the buffer is not correctly capturing the creator properties, leading to the bean being built with incomplete data.\n\nWait, the buffer is a PropertyValueBuffer, which is used to collect the parameters for the creator. So, when a creator property is found, it's added to the buffer. Once all required creator properties are present, the bean is built.\n\nBut perhaps the buffer is not correctly handling the case where the creator property is not the last one, leading to some properties being missed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that after building the bean, the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining properties include both regular and creator properties.\n\nWait, but creator properties are only those that are part of the creator, so once the bean is built, the remaining properties should be regular ones.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for similar issues or think about how the Jackson library handles this.\n\nWait, I recall that in Jackson, when using PropertyBasedCreator, the creator properties are the ones passed to the constructor, and the other properties are set on the bean. So, the code should correctly handle this.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is that when the creator property is not last, the 'name' property is null. So, perhaps the 'name' property is a regular property that's being set after the bean is created, but it's not being set correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the code is not correctly adding the remaining properties to the tokens buffer, so when processUnwrapped is called, it doesn't have all the necessary properties.\n\nLooking at the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\ntokens.writeEndObject();\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n\nBut the tokens buffer was written with the remaining properties. So, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly applying them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens buffer is not correctly capturing all the remaining properties.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\nt = p.nextToken();\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken();\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\nSo, for each remaining FIELD_NAME, it copies the structure into tokens. But perhaps this is not correctly capturing the field names and their values.\n\nWait, when p.nextToken() is called after the creator's value, it points to the next token, which could be FIELD_NAME or END_OBJECT. For each FIELD_NAME, it calls p.nextToken() again, which moves to the value, then copies the current structure (which is the field name and value), and then moves to the next token.\n\nSo, for example, if after the creator property, there's a field \"name\", the code would process it correctly.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling nested structures or arrays, but that's a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the tokens buffer is being written before all properties are processed, leading to missing data.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the code should not be writing the end object until all properties are processed. In the original code, after processing the creator, it writes the end object immediately, which might cause issues.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\ntokens.writeStartObject();\n... processing ...\nif (creatorProp != null) {\n    ... build bean ...\n    tokens.writeEndObject();\n    return ...;\n}\n\nSo, after building the bean, it writes the end object and returns. But what if there are more properties after the creator? The tokens buffer would have been written with the remaining properties, but the main object is being closed.\n\nWait, no, because the tokens buffer is separate. The main parser is still processing the object, and the tokens buffer is capturing the remaining properties.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the tokens buffer is being written with the remaining properties, but the processUnwrapped method is not correctly applying them to the bean.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the creator property is not the last, leading to the 'name' property being null because it's not being set.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'name' property is a regular property that's being buffered, but when the creator is built before it's processed, the buffer isn't correctly setting it on the bean.\n\nWait, no, because the buffer should have all the properties, including the 'name' one, before the creator is built.\n\nWait, no, because the 'name' property might come after the creator property in the JSON. So, when the creator is processed, the 'name' hasn't been read yet, so it's not in the buffer. Then, after building the bean, the 'name' is processed and added to the tokens buffer. But perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly setting it on the bean.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is expecting the properties to be in a certain format, and the way the tokens are being built is causing it to miss the 'name' property.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the solution is to ensure that all properties, including those after the creator, are correctly processed and set on the bean.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is returning immediately after processing the creator property, without allowing the main loop to continue processing the remaining properties. But no, because after building the bean, it processes the remaining properties in the while loop.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not return immediately, but instead let the main loop continue processing. But that might not be possible because once the bean is built, the function needs to return it.\n\nHmm, maybe the solution is to collect all the properties first, including the creator ones, build the bean once all are collected, and then process the remaining properties. But that would require restructuring the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not build the bean until all properties are processed, but that might not be feasible because the bean is needed to set other properties.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is building the bean too early, before all properties are processed. So, the buffer doesn't have all the properties, leading to some being null.\n\nSo, the solution would be to ensure that all properties are processed before building the bean. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code should collect all the properties, including the creator ones, and then build the bean once all are collected. But that would require that the creator can be called after all properties are read, which might not be possible if the creator requires certain properties to be passed as parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should buffer all properties, and once all are read, build the bean using the creator, and then set the remaining properties on the bean.\n\nBut that might require significant changes to the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is building the bean as soon as a creator property is found, but there might be multiple creator properties, and they need to be all processed before building the bean.\n\nLooking at the code, the creatorProp is found, and if buffer.assignParameter returns true, it builds the bean. So, assignParameter returns true only when all required parameters are assigned. So, the code is correct in that aspect.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that after building the bean, the code is not correctly processing the remaining properties, leading to some being missed.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not be returning immediately after processing the creator property, but instead continue processing the remaining properties in the main loop. But that's not possible because once the bean is built, the function needs to return it.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to simulate the code execution with an example.\n\nLet's say the JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"creatorProp\": \"value\",\n  \"name\": \"test\"\n}\n\nIn this case, the code would process \"creatorProp\" first. Since it's a creator property, it would assign it to the buffer. If all required creator properties are present, it builds the bean. Then, it processes the next token, which is FIELD_NAME \"name\". It copies it into tokens. Then, it returns the bean after processing the tokens.\n\nSo, the 'name' property should be set via the tokens.\n\nBut in the buggy case, 'name' is null, which suggests that it's not being set correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the tokens buffer, leading to 'name' not being set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens buffer is not correctly capturing the 'name' property.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\ntokens.writeEndObject();\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n\nSo, the tokens buffer is written with the remaining properties, including 'name', and then passed to processUnwrapped.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly parsing the tokens buffer, leading to 'name' not being set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens buffer is not correctly constructed.\n\nWait, when the code copies the current structure, it's using tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p). So, for each remaining field, it's copying the field name and value into the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, the tokens buffer should have all the remaining properties, including 'name'.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is expecting the tokens to be in a certain format, and the way they're being copied is causing issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the main JSON object is being closed too early, causing the processUnwrapped method to not have access to all properties.\n\nWait, in the code, after processing the creator property, it writes the end object to the tokens buffer. So, the tokens buffer starts with a start object, then the remaining properties, then end object.\n\nBut the main parser is still processing the object, so perhaps the end object in the tokens buffer is causing confusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the tokens buffer when it's already ended.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to not write the end object until all properties are processed.\n\nWait, in the original code, after building the bean, it writes the end object to the tokens buffer immediately. But perhaps this is causing the tokens buffer to be closed too early, leading to the processUnwrapped method not correctly reading all properties.\n\nSo, maybe the solution is to remove the tokens.writeEndObject() call after building the bean, and instead let the main loop handle writing the end object.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\ntokens.writeStartObject();\n... processing ...\nif (creatorProp != null) {\n    ... build bean ...\n    tokens.writeEndObject();\n    return ...;\n}\n\nSo, when the creator property is processed, it writes the end object to the tokens buffer and returns. But perhaps this is causing the tokens buffer to be incomplete.\n\nWait, no, because the tokens buffer is supposed to contain all the remaining properties after the creator. So, writing the end object after adding them should be correct.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the tokens buffer when it's ended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the tokens buffer is being written with the end object, but the main parser is still expecting to read more tokens, leading to a mismatch.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the solution is to ensure that the tokens buffer is correctly capturing all remaining properties without prematurely closing the object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not write the end object in the tokens buffer until all properties are processed.\n\nWait, perhaps the tokens buffer should be written with the start object, then all the remaining properties, and then the end object should be written after all properties are processed.\n\nBut in the current code, after processing the creator, it writes the end object immediately, which might be causing issues.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to move the tokens.writeEndObject() call outside of the creator processing block, so that it's only called once all properties are processed.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not write the end object at all, as the main parser will handle it.\n\nWait, perhaps the tokens buffer is used to collect the unwrapped properties, and the end object should be written only once, after all properties are processed.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to remove the tokens.writeEndObject() call inside the creator processing block, and instead write it after the main loop.\n\nBut looking at the original code, after the main loop, it does:\n\n// We hit END_OBJECT, so:\n... build bean ...\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n\nSo, perhaps the tokens",

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped method. The problem is that when a creator property isn't the last one, the remaining properties aren't processed correctly, leading to null values. The suggestion is to use a two-phase approach: first buffer the creator properties, then process the rest.\n\nLooking at the original code, when a creator property is found, it builds the bean immediately and then tries to process the remaining fields. But if there are more creator properties, this might not capture all of them correctly. Also, after building the bean, it might skip some properties.\n\nSo, the plan is to split the process into two phases. In the first phase, collect all creator properties and buffer them. Then, after all creator properties are processed, build the bean. In the second phase, process the remaining properties and set them on the bean.\n\nWait, but how do I know when all creator properties are processed? Because the JSON object might have other properties after the creator ones. So perhaps I should first collect all the creator properties, build the bean once, and then handle the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is that when a creator property is found, the code builds the bean too early, before all creator properties are read. So the buffer might not have all the necessary parameters, leading to incomplete data.\n\nHmm, in the original code, when a creatorProp is found, it assigns the parameter to the buffer. If that assignment completes all required parameters, it builds the bean immediately. But if there are more creator properties, this approach might not handle them correctly.\n\nWait, the creator's startBuilding method initializes the buffer, and each creator property is assigned via buffer.assignParameter. Once all required parameters are assigned, the creator can build the bean.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is that after building the bean, the code tries to process the remaining properties but doesn't correctly apply them because the bean is already built. Or maybe the remaining properties are not being set because the code assumes that after building, it's done.\n\nIn the original code, after building the bean, it enters a loop to copy the remaining fields into the tokens. Then it calls processUnwrapped. But perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the case where the bean was built early.\n\nSo, to fix this, I should separate the processing into two phases. First, read all the properties, buffering creator properties and others. Then, once all creator properties are processed, build the bean, and then apply the remaining properties.\n\nWait, but the current code already buffers regular properties. So maybe the issue is that when the creator properties are processed and the bean is built, the remaining properties are not correctly applied because the buffer is not used anymore.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code builds the bean as soon as one creator property is fully assigned, but there might be more creator properties to process, leading to an incomplete bean.\n\nWait, the buffer.assignParameter returns true when all required creator properties are assigned. So when that happens, the code builds the bean immediately. But if there are more creator properties, perhaps they are not being handled.\n\nWait, no. The creator's findCreatorProperty method returns null for non-creator properties. So once all creator properties are processed, the code will stop finding creatorProps and move on to regular properties.\n\nBut in the original code, after building the bean, it copies the remaining tokens and then processes unwrapped properties. But perhaps the regular properties that were buffered before building the bean are not being applied correctly.\n\nWait, no. The buffer is used to collect all properties, both creator and regular. So when the bean is built, it should have all the properties set. But maybe the problem is that when the bean is built early, the remaining properties are not being set because the code assumes that after building, it's done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where after building the bean, there are still properties left that need to be set via setters or other means.\n\nWait, looking at the code, after building the bean, it loops through the remaining fields, copies them into the tokens, and then calls processUnwrapped. But processUnwrapped might not be correctly handling these remaining properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is designed to handle the case where the bean is built, and then the remaining properties are applied. But in the original code, when the bean is built early, the tokens are being written, but maybe the order is causing issues.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to first collect all the creator properties, build the bean once all are collected, and then process the remaining properties. So, in the first phase, we read all creator properties and buffer them. Then, after all creator properties are processed, build the bean. Then, in the second phase, process the remaining properties and apply them to the bean.\n\nWait, but how do I know when all creator properties are processed? Because the JSON object is being read sequentially. So perhaps the approach is to read all the properties, separate creator properties and others, buffer the creator ones, and then build the bean once all creator properties are read. Then, apply the remaining properties.\n\nBut that might not be feasible because the creator properties can be in any order, and the buffer needs to collect all of them before building.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is building the bean as soon as one of the creator properties is fully assigned, but there are more creator properties that haven't been processed yet. So the bean is built prematurely, leading to missing data.\n\nWait, no. The buffer.assignParameter returns true only when all required creator properties are assigned. So the code builds the bean only when all required creator properties are present. So that part should be okay.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after building the bean, it's still processing the remaining properties. So perhaps the problem is that the remaining properties are being written into the tokens, but not correctly applied to the bean.\n\nWait, the processUnwrapped method is called with the tokens, which contain the remaining properties. So perhaps that method is supposed to apply those properties to the bean. But maybe it's not handling them correctly when the bean was built early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when the bean is built early, the buffer is not being used to set the regular properties, leading to nulls.\n\nWait, looking at the code again: after building the bean, it loops through the remaining fields, copies them into the tokens, and then calls processUnwrapped. So the tokens should have all the remaining properties, which are then processed.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling these properties, especially if the bean was built early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the object, leading to the buffer not being fully utilized.\n\nHmm, maybe the solution is to separate the processing into two phases: first, collect all creator properties and buffer them, then build the bean once all are collected. Then, process the remaining properties and apply them to the bean.\n\nSo, in the code, I can modify it to first loop through all the properties, buffering creator properties and others. Then, after the loop, build the bean. Then, process the remaining properties.\n\nWait, but the current code already does that. Let me see:\n\nThe code starts by initializing the buffer. Then, it reads each field. For each field, if it's a creator property, it assigns it to the buffer. If the assignment completes all required parameters, it builds the bean immediately, then copies the remaining fields into tokens, and processes unwrapped.\n\nOtherwise, it continues buffering.\n\nWait, but if the bean is built in the middle of processing, the remaining properties are processed as part of the tokens, but perhaps the buffer is not being used anymore.\n\nWait, after building the bean, the code writes the remaining fields into the tokens, then calls processUnwrapped, which probably applies those fields to the bean. But perhaps the buffer is not being used after that, leading to missing properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buffer is being used correctly, but the processUnwrapped is not handling the case where the bean was built early.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the code builds the bean too early, before all properties are read, leading to the buffer not containing all the necessary data.\n\nWait, but the buffer is supposed to collect all properties, both creator and regular. So when the bean is built, it should have all the properties up to that point. Then, the remaining properties are added via the tokens.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that when the bean is built early, the buffer is not being used to set the regular properties, leading to some properties being null.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the JSON object, leading to the remaining properties not being applied.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps the code should not build the bean until all properties are processed. That way, all creator and regular properties are buffered, and then the bean is built once, with all properties set.\n\nBut wait, the creator requires that all its parameters are set before building. So if we wait until all properties are read, including non-creator ones, then the buffer may have all the creator properties, allowing the bean to be built correctly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read all properties, buffering both creator and regular properties.\n2. Once all properties are read, build the bean using the buffer.\n3. Then, process any remaining properties (if any) via the tokens.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the bean is built either when all creator properties are assigned or at the end of the loop. So perhaps the problem is that when the bean is built in the middle, the remaining properties are not correctly applied.\n\nSo, to ensure that all properties are processed, perhaps the bean should be built only once, after all properties are read.\n\nSo, modifying the code to not build the bean in the middle, but only at the end.\n\nBut that might not be possible because the creator may require that the bean is built as soon as all creator properties are assigned.\n\nWait, but the creator's build method is called with the buffer, which contains all the properties, including regular ones. So perhaps building the bean at the end would include all properties.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think: the buffer is used to collect both creator and regular properties. So, if I build the bean at the end, after all properties are processed, the buffer should have all the necessary data.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the part where the bean is built in the middle, and only build it once at the end.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the creator may require that the bean is built as soon as all creator parameters are available.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that when the bean is built in the middle, the buffer is not fully populated with all regular properties, leading to some being missed.\n\nWait, in the original code, when a creator property is processed and the buffer is complete, the bean is built. Then, the remaining properties are read and added to the tokens. Then, processUnwrapped is called, which probably sets those properties on the bean.\n\nBut perhaps processUnwrapped is not correctly handling the case where the bean was built early, leading to some properties not being set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the buffer is not being used after building the bean, so any regular properties that were buffered before building are not being applied.\n\nWait, no. The buffer is passed to creator.build(), which should set all the properties, including regular ones that were buffered.\n\nWait, perhaps the buffer contains both creator and regular properties. So when the bean is built, all properties are set. Then, the remaining properties are processed via the tokens.\n\nBut in the original code, after building the bean, it's still processing the remaining properties and adding them to the tokens. So perhaps the processUnwrapped method is supposed to apply those properties to the bean.\n\nBut maybe the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the case where the bean is already built, leading to the 'name' object being null.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to ensure that all properties are processed and applied to the bean, regardless of when it's built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the bean is built early, the remaining properties are being written to the tokens, but not correctly applied because the processUnwrapped method expects the bean to be built after all properties are read.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. The method starts by initializing the buffer with the creator.\n2. It reads each field name and processes the value.\n3. If the field is a creator property, it's added to the buffer. If the buffer is complete, the bean is built, and the remaining fields are added to tokens.\n4. If not a creator property, it's either a regular property (buffered) or an ignorable or any property.\n5. After all fields are processed, the bean is built (if not already built) and processUnwrapped is called.\n\nThe problem occurs when the bean is built before all fields are processed, leading to some properties not being set correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that all properties are processed before building the bean. But that might not be possible because the creator may require building as soon as all its parameters are available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that after building the bean, the code doesn't correctly apply the remaining properties.\n\nWait, looking at the code after building the bean:\n\nIt writes the remaining fields into the tokens, then calls processUnwrapped with the tokens. So, processUnwrapped should handle those remaining properties.\n\nBut perhaps processUnwrapped is not correctly applying them when the bean is built early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the buffer is not being used after the bean is built, so any regular properties buffered before building are not being applied.\n\nWait, no. The buffer is passed to creator.build(), which should apply all buffered properties, including regular ones.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when the bean is built early, the buffer is not fully populated with all regular properties, leading to some being null.\n\nWait, no. The buffer should have all the regular properties that were processed before the bean was built. The remaining properties are added to the tokens and processed via processUnwrapped.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that processUnwrapped is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built early, leading to the 'name' object not being set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the JSON object, leading to the remaining properties not being applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is designed to handle the case where the bean is built at the end, and when it's called earlier, it doesn't process the tokens correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens are not being properly reset or written when the bean is built early.\n\nHmm, maybe the solution is to ensure that all properties are processed and applied to the bean, regardless of when it's built. So, perhaps the code should be restructured to collect all properties first, build the bean once, and then apply any remaining properties.\n\nBut that might not be feasible because the creator may require building as soon as all parameters are available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not build the bean in the middle, but wait until all properties are read.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the creator may need to be built as soon as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the bean is built in the middle, the buffer is not being used to set the regular properties, leading to some being null. So, perhaps the fix is to ensure that after building the bean, the buffer is still used to set any remaining regular properties.\n\nWait, no. The buffer is used to build the bean, which should include all properties up to that point. The remaining properties are handled via the tokens.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the JSON object, leading to the 'name' field not being set because it's part of the remaining properties.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to ensure that after building the bean, the remaining properties are correctly applied.\n\nLooking at the code, after building the bean, it loops through the remaining fields, copies them into the tokens, and then calls processUnwrapped. So, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly applying those properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is expecting the bean to be built after all properties are read, and when it's built earlier, it doesn't handle the tokens correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the processUnwrapped method, but since I can't change that, I need to adjust the current method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly resetting the buffer after building the bean, leading to regular properties not being applied.\n\nWait, perhaps after building the bean, the buffer is no longer used, so any regular properties that were buffered before building are not applied.\n\nNo, because the buffer is passed to creator.build(), which should apply all the properties, including regular ones.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think differently.\n\nThe root cause is that when a creator property is not the last, the remaining properties are not correctly processed, leading to nulls.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should not build the bean until all properties are read, ensuring that all creator and regular properties are buffered, and then the bean is built once, with all properties set.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nIn the original code, the bean is built either when all creator properties are assigned or at the end. So perhaps the problem is that when it's built in the middle, some regular properties are not yet buffered.\n\nWait, no. The buffer is collecting all properties, both creator and regular, as they are read. So when the bean is built, it should have all the properties up to that point, and the remaining are added via tokens.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the tokens when the bean is built early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the JSON object, leading to the 'name' field not being set.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'name' field is a regular property that is being buffered, but when the bean is built early, it's not being set because the buffer is not fully populated.\n\nNo, because the buffer is passed to the creator.build() method, which should set all buffered properties.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to ensure that all properties are processed and applied to the bean, regardless of when it's built.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified to collect all properties, build the bean once, and then apply any remaining properties.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not build the bean in the middle. Instead, it should collect all properties, and then build the bean at the end.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the creator may require building as soon as all parameters are available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should build the bean only once, after all properties are read.\n\nBut that might cause issues if the creator requires parameters that are not available until later.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the code is building the bean before all creator properties are read, leading to missing parameters.\n\nWait, no. The buffer.assignParameter returns true only when all required creator properties are assigned. So the bean is built only when all required creator properties are present.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that after building the bean, the remaining properties are not being applied correctly.\n\nLooking at the code again, after building the bean, it writes the remaining fields into the tokens, then calls processUnwrapped.\n\nSo, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the tokens when the bean is built early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens are not being written correctly.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n...\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n\nSo, the tokens contain all the remaining properties after the creator properties.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is expecting the tokens to represent the entire object, not just the remaining part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens are not being reset correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to ensure that all properties are processed, and that the bean is built only once, after all properties are read.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to implement that without changing the method's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the JSON object, leading to the 'name' property not being set.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that after building the bean, the remaining properties are correctly applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not return immediately after building the bean, but instead continue processing the remaining properties.\n\nBut in the original code, after building the bean, it loops through the remaining fields, copies them into tokens, and then returns.\n\nSo, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is supposed to apply those tokens to the bean.\n\nBut perhaps the processUnwrapped method is not correctly handling the tokens when the bean is built early.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens are not being written correctly.\n\nWait, in the code, after building the bean, it does:\n\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken();\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n\nSo, it's copying all the remaining fields into the tokens.\n\nThen, it calls processUnwrapped with the tokens.\n\nSo, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is supposed to deserialize the tokens and apply them to the bean.\n\nBut perhaps when the bean is built early, the tokens are not correctly structured, leading to the 'name' property not being applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is expecting the tokens to be in a certain state.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to ensure that the tokens are correctly written, including the start and end objects.\n\nWait, in the original code, tokens.writeStartObject() is called before the loop. Then, for each field, if it's a creator property and the bean is built, the remaining fields are copied into tokens, and then tokens.writeEndObject() is called.\n\nSo, the tokens should represent the remaining part of the JSON object.\n\nBut when processUnwrapped is called, it's given the tokens, which should be a valid JSON object.\n\nSo, perhaps the processUnwrapped method is correctly handling this.\n\nBut the issue is that the 'name' property is null, implying that it's not being set.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the 'name' property is part of the remaining properties, but it's not being correctly applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'name' property is a regular property that's being buffered, but when the bean is built early, it's not being set because the buffer is not fully populated.\n\nNo, because the buffer is passed to creator.build(), which should set all buffered properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'name' property is part of the tokens, but processUnwrapped is not correctly applying it.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to ensure that all properties, both buffered and tokenized, are applied to the bean.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to do that without changing the processUnwrapped method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the bean is built early, the buffer is not being used to set the regular properties, leading to some being null.\n\nWait, no. The buffer is passed to creator.build(), which should handle all properties.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the bean is built before the end of the JSON object, leading to the 'name' property not being set.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that all properties are processed, regardless of when the bean is built.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not build the bean until all properties are read, ensuring that all creator and regular properties are buffered.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the creator may require building as soon as all parameters are available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should build the bean only once, after all properties are read.\n\nBut that might not be feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to separate the processing into two phases: first, read all creator properties and buffer them, then build the bean, then read the remaining properties and apply them.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be modified to first loop through all properties, buffering creator and regular properties.
