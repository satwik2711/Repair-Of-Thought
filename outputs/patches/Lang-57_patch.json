      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `isAvailableLocale(Locale locale)` function does not handle null inputs properly. When the `locale` parameter is null, the function attempts to call `contains()` on the `cAvailableLocaleSet` set, which results in a `NullPointerException`. This is because the `contains()` method is called on a null object reference.\nSuggestion: Null Check\nAdd a null check at the beginning of the `isAvailableLocale(Locale locale)` function. If the `locale` parameter is null, return false immediately. This will prevent the `NullPointerException` from occurring. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    if (locale == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return cAvailableLocaleSet.contains(locale);\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, but it may not be the most elegant solution.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    return cAvailableLocaleSet.contains(locale);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This will prevent the `NullPointerException` from occurring and provide a more elegant solution. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    return Optional.ofNullable(locale).map(cAvailableLocaleSet::contains).orElse(false);\n}\n```\nThis solution uses the `Optional` class to wrap the `locale` parameter and provides a safe way to navigate the `cAvailableLocaleSet` set.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    return cAvailableLocaleSet.contains(locale);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When the `locale` parameter is null, the function attempts to call `contains()` on the `cAvailableLocaleSet` set, which results in a `NullPointerException`. This is because the `contains()` method is called on a null object reference.\nSuggestion: Defensive Programming\nUse defensive programming techniques to ensure that the `locale` parameter is never null. This can be achieved by adding a null check at the beginning of the function and throwing an exception if the `locale` parameter is null. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    if (locale == null) {\n        throw new NullPointerException(\"locale cannot be null\");\n    }\n    return cAvailableLocaleSet.contains(locale);\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the `locale` parameter is never null and provides a clear error message if it is.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean isAvailableLocale(Locale locale) {\n    return cAvailableLocaleSet.contains(locale);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
