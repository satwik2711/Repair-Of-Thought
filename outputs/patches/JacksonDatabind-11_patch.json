      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `_fromVariable` function does not properly handle recursive type variables. When the function encounters a recursive type variable, it tries to resolve it by adding a placeholder to the context. However, this approach is not sufficient to handle all cases of recursive type variables. Specifically, when the type variable is used as a bound in another type variable, the function fails to resolve it correctly.\nSuggestion: Improve Recursive Type Variable Resolution\nOne possible fix is to modify the `_fromVariable` function to use a more sophisticated approach to resolve recursive type variables. Instead of simply adding a placeholder to the context, we could try to resolve the type variable by recursively calling the `_fromVariable` function with the bound type as the new context. This would allow us to handle cases where the type variable is used as a bound in another type variable.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected JavaType _fromVariable(TypeVariable<?> type, TypeBindings context)\n{\n    // ...
