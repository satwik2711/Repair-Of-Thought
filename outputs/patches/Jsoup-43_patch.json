      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `indexInList` function is using the `equals` method to compare elements, which is not the correct way to compare elements in this context. The `equals` method checks for deep equality, which means it checks if the two elements have the same content, attributes, and child elements. However, in this case, we only need to check if the two elements are the same instance, not if they have the same content. This is because the `elementSiblingIndex` method is supposed to return the index of the element in the list of sibling elements, not the index of an element with the same content.\nSuggestion: Use Reference Equality\nOne possible fix is to use reference equality instead of deep equality. We can replace the `equals` method with the `==` operator, which checks if the two elements are the same instance. This will ensure that the `indexInList` function correctly identifies the index of the element in the list. The corrected `indexInList` function would be:\n```java\nprivate static <E extends Element> Integer indexInList(Element search, List<E> elements) {\n    Validate.notNull(search);\n    Validate.notNull(elements);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {\n        E element = elements.get(i);\n        if (element == search)\n            return i;\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static <E extends Element> Integer indexInList(Element search, List<E> elements) {\n    Validate.notNull(search);\n    Validate.notNull(elements);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {\n        E element = elements.get(i);\n        if (element.equals(search))\n            return i;\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the `elementSiblingIndex` method is supposed to return the index of the element in the list of sibling elements, not the index of an element with the same content.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Comparison Method\nAnother possible fix is to use a different comparison method that takes into account the specific requirements of the `elementSiblingIndex` method. For example, we could use a method that checks if the two elements have the same tag name and attributes, but not necessarily the same content. This would ensure that the `indexInList` function correctly identifies the index of the element in the list, while also allowing for different content. The corrected `indexInList` function would be:\n```java\nprivate static <E extends Element> Integer indexInList(Element search, List<E> elements) {\n    Validate.notNull(search);\n    Validate.notNull(elements);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {\n        E element = elements.get(i);\n        if (element.tagName().equals(search.tagName()) && element.attributes().equals(search.attributes()))\n            return i;\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static <E extends Element> Integer indexInList(Element search, List<E> elements) {\n    Validate.notNull(search);\n    Validate.notNull(elements);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {\n        E element = elements.get(i);\n        if (element.equals(search))\n            return i;\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the `elementSiblingIndex` method is supposed to return the index of the element in the list of sibling elements, not the index of an element with the same content.\nSuggestion: Use a Custom Comparison Method\nA third possible fix is to use a custom comparison method that is specifically designed for the `elementSiblingIndex` method. This method could take into account the specific requirements of the method, such as checking if the two elements are sibling elements, and return a boolean value indicating whether the two elements are the same. This would ensure that the `indexInList` function correctly identifies the index of the element in the list, while also allowing for custom comparison logic. The corrected `indexInList` function would be:\n```java\nprivate static <E extends Element> Integer indexInList(Element search, List<E> elements) {\n    Validate.notNull(search);\n    Validate.notNull(elements);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {\n        E element = elements.get(i);\n        if (isSiblingElement(element, search))\n            return i;\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\nprivate static boolean isSiblingElement(Element element1, Element element2) {\n    // Custom comparison logic to check if two elements are sibling elements\n    // This could involve checking if the two elements have the same parent element, etc.\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static <E extends Element> Integer indexInList(Element search, List<E> elements) {\n    Validate.notNull(search);\n    Validate.notNull(elements);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); i++) {\n        E element = elements.get(i);\n        if (element.equals(search))\n            return i;\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
