      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `nextToken()` function does not correctly handle the case when multiple matches are not allowed. Specifically, when the filter matches a name, it does not check if the current token is already included in the output. As a result, multiple tokens with the same name are included in the output, leading to incorrect results.\nSuggestion: Add a Flag to Track Included Tokens\nOne possible fix is to add a flag to track whether a token has already been included in the output. We can add a boolean field `included` to the `TokenFilterContext` class to track this. When a token is included in the output, we set the `included` flag to true. Before including a token in the output, we check the `included` flag. If it is true, we skip the token.\n// Buggy Function\n    public JsonToken nextToken() throws IOException\n    {\n    \t//Check for _allowMultipleMatches - false and atleast there is one token - which is _currToken\n    \t// check for no buffered context _exposedContext - null\n    \t//If all the conditions matches then check for scalar / non-scalar property\n    \t\t//if not scalar and ended successfully, then return null\n    \t\t//else if scalar, and scalar not present in obj/array and !includePath and INCLUDE_ALL matched once\n    \t\t// then return null \n        // Anything buffered?\n        TokenFilterContext ctxt = _exposedContext;\n\n        if (ctxt != null) {\n            while (true) {\n                JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n                if (t != null) {\n                    _currToken = t;\n                    return t;\n                }\n                // all done with buffered stuff?\n                if (ctxt == _headContext) {\n                    _exposedContext = null;\n                    if (ctxt.inArray()) {\n                        t = delegate.getCurrentToken();\n// Is this guaranteed to work without further checks?\n//                        if (t != JsonToken.START_ARRAY) {\n                        _currToken = t;\n                        return t;\n                    }\n\n                    // Almost!

Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `nextToken()` function does not correctly handle the case when multiple matches are not allowed. Specifically, when the filter matches a name, it does not check if the current token is already included in the output. As a result, multiple tokens with the same name are included in the output, leading to incorrect results.\nSuggestion: Use a More Efficient Data Structure\nA third possible fix is to use a more efficient data structure to keep track of the included tokens. We can use a `HashMap` to map the token names to their corresponding tokens. When a token is included in the output, we add it to the `HashMap`. Before including a token in the output, we check if it is already in the `HashMap`.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the nextToken() function. The root cause is that when multiple matches aren't allowed, the function doesn't check if a token is already included, leading to duplicates. The suggestion is to add a flag to track included tokens.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the TokenFilterContext class. I need to add a boolean field called 'included' to it. This will help track whether a token has been included in the output already.\n\nNow, looking at the nextToken() function. I need to modify it to use this new flag. When a token is included, I'll set 'included' to true. Before including a token, I'll check this flag. If it's true, I'll skip adding it again.\n\nI should go through the function step by step. Let's see where tokens are being added to the output. In the case where _exposedContext is not null, it loops to get the next token. I'll need to check if the token is already included before returning it.\n\nWait, in the loop where ctxt.nextTokenToRead() is called, I should add a condition. If the token is not null, I should check if it's already included. If not, include it and set the flag. Otherwise, skip.\n\nAlso, in other parts where tokens are returned, like after handling arrays or objects, I need to ensure that the 'included' flag is checked and set appropriately.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Every time I'm about to return a token, I should mark it as included in the context. Then, in the next calls, if the same token is encountered again, it will be skipped.\n\nSo, in the case where ctxt is not null, after getting t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead(), I'll check if t is not null. Then, I'll check if ctxt's included flag is false. If so, I'll include it, set the flag, and return t. Otherwise, I'll continue the loop.\n\nSimilarly, in other sections where tokens are returned, I'll need to set the included flag. For example, when handling scalar values, after deciding to include the token, I'll mark it as included.\n\nWait, but how is the context structured? Each context might represent a different scope, so the included flag should be per context. So, when a token is included in one context, it's not included in others. Hmm, maybe I need to have the included flag per token, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the context's included flag is sufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'included' flag should be part of the TokenFilterContext. So, each context has its own flag indicating whether the current token has been included. That way, when processing nested structures, each level can track its own included status.\n\nSo, in the loop where ctxt is processed, after getting t, I'll check if ctxt's included is false. If so, include t, set included to true, and return. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Add 'included' boolean field to TokenFilterContext.\n\n2. In the loop where ctxt is not null:\n   a. Get t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead()\n   b. If t is not null:\n      i. If ctxt.included is false:\n         - set ctxt.included = true\n         - return t\n      ii. Else, skip this token and continue the loop.\n\n3. In other parts of the function where tokens are returned, ensure that the context's included flag is set to true after including the token.\n\nWait, but in the current code, after getting t from delegate.nextToken(), there are various cases handled. For each case, when a token is returned, I should mark the context's included flag as true.\n\nFor example, in the case of ID_START_ARRAY, after creating the child context and returning t, I should set the context's included flag.\n\nBut wait, in the current code, when _exposedContext is set, the nextToken() function returns the token. So, perhaps the 'included' flag should be set in the context when the token is returned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'included' flag should be checked before including the token in the output.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\nWhen _exposedContext is not null, the function enters a loop to process buffered tokens. For each token, it checks if it's already included. If not, it includes it and sets the flag.\n\nIn other cases, when the function reads a new token from the delegate, it processes it based on its type. For each case, after deciding to include the token, it should mark the context's included flag.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'included' flag should be part of the context that's currently being processed. So, when a token is included in the output, the context's included flag is set to true, preventing it from being included again.\n\nSo, in the code, whenever a token is about to be returned, I should check if the current context's included flag is false. If so, include it and set the flag to true. Otherwise, skip.\n\nLet me look at the code again.\n\nIn the case where _exposedContext is not null, the loop is:\n\nwhile (true) {\n    JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n    if (t != null) {\n        _currToken = t;\n        return t;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nI need to modify this part to check if the token is already included. So, perhaps:\n\nwhile (true) {\n    JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n    if (t != null) {\n        if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n            ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n            _currToken = t;\n            return t;\n        } else {\n            // Token already included, skip\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nBut wait, the 'included' flag is per context. So, each context can have its own flag.\n\nNow, in other parts of the function, when a token is returned, I need to ensure that the context's included flag is set.\n\nFor example, in the case of ID_START_ARRAY:\n\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    _headContext = _headContext.createChildArrayContext(f, true);\n    return (_currToken = t);\n}\n\nHere, when returning t, I should set the context's included flag to true.\n\nBut wait, the context is _headContext, which is the parent context. Or perhaps the new child context?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nEach time a token is included in the output, the context that is responsible for that token should mark it as included, so that it's not included again.\n\nSo, in the case where _exposedContext is not null, and we're processing buffered tokens, each token is part of a specific context. So, when we include a token from that context, we mark it as included in that context.\n\nIn other cases, like when processing a new token from the delegate, the decision to include it is based on the current context's filter. Once included, the context's included flag should be set.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'included' flag should be part of the TokenFilterContext, indicating whether the current token in that context has been included.\n\nSo, when a context is created, its included flag is false. When a token is included from that context, the flag is set to true.\n\nThus, in the loop where we process the exposed context, each token is checked against the context's included flag.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (ctxt != null) {\n    while (true) {\n        JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n        if (t != null) {\n            if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n                ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n                _currToken = t;\n                return t;\n            } else {\n                // Already included, move to next token\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, the nextTokenToRead() method might be returning the same token multiple times if not handled correctly. So, perhaps the loop should continue until a token that hasn't been included is found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nextTokenToRead() method should handle the included flag internally, so that once a token is included, it's not returned again.\n\nBut that might require changes to the TokenFilterContext class's nextTokenToRead() method.\n\nAlternatively, in the nextToken() function, after getting t from nextTokenToRead(), check the included flag and proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\nJsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\nif (t != null) {\n    if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n        ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n        _currToken = t;\n        return t;\n    } else {\n        // Skip this token and continue\n        continue;\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, the loop will keep fetching tokens until it finds one that hasn't been included yet.\n\nNow, in other parts of the function, when a token is included, I need to set the context's included flag.\n\nFor example, in the case of ID_START_ARRAY:\n\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    _headContext = _headContext.createChildArrayContext(f, true);\n    // After including this token, set the included flag\n    _headContext.setIncluded(true);\n    return (_currToken = t);\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, the token is the START_ARRAY, and it's being included. So, the context that's handling this token should mark it as included.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of ID_FIELD_NAME, after including the token, set the context's included flag.\n\nWait, perhaps every time a token is returned, the current context's included flag should be set to true.\n\nSo, in the function, after setting _currToken = t and before returning, set the context's included flag.\n\nBut which context? Because the context could be _headContext or a child context.\n\nHmm, perhaps the context that is responsible for the current token is the one that should have its included flag set.\n\nWait, perhaps the _headContext is the current context, and when a token is included, the _headContext's included flag is set.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'included' flag should be a part of the TokenFilterContext, and each time a token is included from that context, the flag is set.\n\nSo, in the case where _exposedContext is not null, and we're processing buffered tokens, each token is part of the current context, and once included, the flag is set.\n\nIn other cases, when processing tokens from the delegate, the current context is _headContext, and when a token is included, the _headContext's included flag is set.\n\nWait, but in the code, after processing a token, the function returns it. So, perhaps after returning, the next call to nextToken() will continue processing.\n\nSo, perhaps the 'included' flag should be checked each time before including a token.\n\nAnother approach: whenever a token is about to be returned, check if it's already been included in the current context. If not, include it and mark it as included.\n\nSo, in the code, after obtaining a token (t), before returning it, check if the current context's included flag is false. If so, include it and set the flag. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut how to determine the current context? It depends on where the token is coming from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should have a helper method to check and set the included flag before returning a token.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to modify the code in the loop where _exposedContext is processed, adding the check for the included flag.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\nwhile (true) {\n    JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n    if (t != null) {\n        if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n            ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n            _currToken = t;\n            return t;\n        } else {\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n    // ... rest of the code\n}\n\nThis way, the loop will keep fetching tokens until it finds one that hasn't been included yet.\n\nIn other parts of the function, when a token is included, I need to set the context's included flag.\n\nFor example, in the case where t is a scalar value and is included:\n\nif ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL)\n        || ((f != null) && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n    if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n        ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, ctxt is _headContext. So, perhaps I should check _headContext's included flag before including the token.\n\nSo, in the default case (scalar value):\n\nf = _itemFilter;\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    if (!_headContext.isIncluded()) {\n        _headContext.setIncluded(true);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n// ... other conditions\n\nBut wait, perhaps the 'included' flag should be checked for the current context before including any token.\n\nSo, in all places where a token is about to be returned, I should check the context's included flag. If it's false, include the token and set the flag to true. Otherwise, skip.\n\nThis would require modifying all return points in the function to include this check.\n\nBut that might be a lot of changes. Alternatively, perhaps the function can be restructured to have a single point where the token is returned, after checking the included flag.\n\nBut given the complexity of the function, that might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'included' flag should be part of the TokenFilterContext, and each time a token is included, the context's flag is set. Then, in the nextToken() function, whenever a token is about to be returned, the function checks the context's included flag. If it's false, the token is included, and the flag is set. If it's true, the function skips returning it.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nIn the loop where _exposedContext is processed:\n\nJsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\nif (t != null) {\n    if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n        ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n        _currToken = t;\n        return t;\n    } else {\n        continue;\n    }\n}\n\nIn other cases, like when handling ID_START_ARRAY:\n\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    _headContext = _headContext.createChildArrayContext(f, true);\n    if (!_headContext.isIncluded()) {\n        _headContext.setIncluded(true);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, the token is START_ARRAY, and it's being included. So, the new child context's included flag should be set.\n\nBut perhaps the 'included' flag is for the context itself, indicating whether the context's token has been included.\n\nSo, each context has its own 'included' flag, which is set when its token is included.\n\nTherefore, in the case of creating a new child context, the included flag is initially false. When the token is included, the flag is set to true.\n\nSo, in the code, whenever a token is included, the corresponding context's included flag is set.\n\nThis approach should prevent multiple inclusions of the same token.\n\nNow, I'll need to modify the code accordingly.\n\nFirst, add the 'included' field to TokenFilterContext.\n\nThen, in the nextToken() function, whenever a token is about to be returned, check the context's included flag. If not included, include it and set the flag. Otherwise, skip.\n\nSo, let's outline the changes:\n\n1. In TokenFilterContext, add:\n\nprivate boolean included = false;\n\npublic boolean isIncluded() {\n    return included;\n}\n\npublic void setIncluded(boolean included) {\n    this.included = included;\n}\n\n2. In the nextToken() function, modify the loop where _exposedContext is processed:\n\nif (ctxt != null) {\n    while (true) {\n        JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n        if (t != null) {\n            if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n                ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n                _currToken = t;\n                return t;\n            } else {\n                // Token already included, continue to next\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code\n    }\n}\n\n3. In other parts of the function, when a token is included, set the context's included flag.\n\nFor example, in the case of ID_START_ARRAY:\n\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    _headContext = _headContext.createChildArrayContext(f, true);\n    if (!_headContext.isIncluded()) {\n        _headContext.setIncluded(true);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, the token is START_ARRAY, and it's being included. So, the new child context's included flag should be set.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of ID_FIELD_NAME, after including the token, set the context's included flag.\n\nBut wait, in the case of ID_FIELD_NAME, the token is FIELD_NAME, which is part of the current context. So, after including it, the context's included flag should be set.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\ncase ID_FIELD_NAME:\n    {\n        // ... existing code\n        if (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n            _itemFilter = f;\n            if (!_includePath) {\n                // ... existing code\n            }\n            if (!_headContext.isIncluded()) {\n                _headContext.setIncluded(true);\n                return (_currToken = t);\n            }\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code\n    }\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe the 'included' flag should be set right before returning the token, regardless of the case.\n\nSo, in all places where the function returns a token, I should check if the current context's included flag is false. If so, include it and set the flag. Otherwise, don't return it.\n\nBut how to determine the current context in each case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should have a helper method that, given a context and a token, checks if it's included and handles it.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the minimal change is to modify the loop where _exposedContext is processed, adding the check for the included flag, and setting it when the token is included.\n\nThis should handle the case where multiple tokens are being buffered and prevent duplicates.\n\nSo, to summarize, the main changes are:\n\n- Add 'included' field to TokenFilterContext.\n- In the loop processing _exposedContext, check and set the included flag before returning the token.\n\nI think this should fix the issue where multiple tokens with the same name are included when they shouldn't be.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the bug where the `nextToken()` function incorrectly includes multiple tokens with the same name when multiple matches are not allowed, we add a flag to track included tokens. This ensures each token is only included once.\n\n```java\npublic JsonToken nextToken() throws IOException\n{\n    // Anything buffered?\n    TokenFilterContext ctxt = _exposedContext;\n\n    if (ctxt != null) {\n        while (true) {\n            JsonToken t = ctxt.nextTokenToRead();\n            if (t != null) {\n                if (!ctxt.isIncluded()) {\n                    ctxt.setIncluded(true);\n                    _currToken = t;\n                    return t;\n                } else {\n                    continue;\n                }\n            }\n            // all done with buffered stuff?\n            if (ctxt == _headContext) {\n                _exposedContext = null;\n                if (ctxt.inArray()) {\n                    t = delegate.getCurrentToken();\n                    _currToken = t;\n                    return t;\n                }\n\n                // Almost!

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the nextToken() function. The problem is that when multiple matches are not allowed, the function doesn't check if a token with the same name is already included in the output. So, it ends up including multiple tokens with the same name, which is incorrect.\n\nThe suggestion is to use a HashMap to track included tokens. So, I'll need to add a HashMap, probably as a field in the class, to keep track of the token names that have been included.\n\nLet me look at the function step by step.\n\nFirst, when the function starts, it checks if there's an exposed context. If so, it processes buffered tokens. I need to make sure that when adding tokens from the buffer, I check the HashMap to avoid duplicates.\n\nWait, but the root cause is specifically when the filter matches a name, and it doesn't check if the token is already included. So, perhaps the issue is in the part where tokens are being added to the output without checking for duplicates.\n\nLooking at the code, in the case of ID_FIELD_NAME, after setting the field name, it processes the filter. If the filter includes the property, it might add the token. But it doesn't check if a token with the same name is already present.\n\nSo, I think the fix should be applied in the section where tokens are being included. Specifically, when a token is about to be returned, we should check if it's already in the HashMap. If it is, we skip it. If not, we add it to the HashMap and return it.\n\nWait, but the function is supposed to handle multiple matches. So, when _allowMultipleMatches is false, we should ensure that each token name is only included once.\n\nSo, perhaps in the case where a token is a scalar value, or a field name, we need to check if it's already been included.\n\nLet me think about where to place the check.\n\nIn the default case (scalar value), after checking the filter, if the token is to be included, we should check the HashMap. If the token's name is already present, we skip returning it. Otherwise, we add it to the HashMap and return it.\n\nSimilarly, in the ID_FIELD_NAME case, when the field is included, we should check if the name is already in the HashMap.\n\nWait, but field names are in objects, and each field name should be unique within an object, so maybe that's not the issue. The problem might be more with array elements where multiple items could have the same name or value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that when the filter includes a token, it doesn't check if a token with the same name has already been included in the output, leading to duplicates.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Add a HashMap to track the names of tokens that have been included. Let's call it includedTokens.\n\n2. When a token is about to be returned, check if its name is in includedTokens. If yes, skip it. If no, add it to the map and return it.\n\nBut wait, the function returns JsonToken, which has a method getCurrentName() perhaps? Or maybe the token's name is stored elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is obtained via delegate.getCurrentName() for field names, but for other tokens, it's different.\n\nHmm, this might complicate things. Because for different token types, the way to get the name varies.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is specifically with field names. So, when a field name is processed, if it's included, we add it to the HashMap. Then, if another field with the same name is encountered, it's skipped.\n\nBut in JSON, an object can't have duplicate field names, so that's probably not the case. So maybe the issue is with array elements where multiple items have the same value, and the filter includes them, but we only want to include the first occurrence.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is in the scalar case. When a scalar value is included, if it's already been included before, it should be skipped.\n\nSo, in the default case (scalar), after determining that the token should be included, we check if the value is already in the HashMap. If yes, we don't return it. If no, we add it and return.\n\nBut wait, the function is called nextToken(), which returns the next token in the stream. So, perhaps the approach is to track the names of the tokens that have been included, and when a new token is processed, if it's a scalar and its value is already in the map, we skip it by not returning it, thus moving to the next token.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- When processing a token, if it's a scalar and _allowMultipleMatches is false, check if its value is already in the includedTokens map.\n\n- If it is, skip this token and proceed to the next one.\n\n- If it's not, add it to the map and return it.\n\nBut how do we get the value of the scalar token? Because the delegate might have the current value, which can be retrieved via delegate.getText() or similar.\n\nSo, in the default case, after the filter allows the token, we get the value, check the map, and proceed accordingly.\n\nLet me look at the code again.\n\nIn the default case:\n\nf = _itemFilter;\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    return (_currToken = t);\n}\nif (f != null) {\n    f = _headContext.checkValue(f);\n    if ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL)\n            || ((f != null) && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n        // Here, the token is to be included\n        // So, before returning, check if it's already included\n        String value = delegate.getText();\n        if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n            // Skip this token\n            // So, do not return it, and proceed to next token\n            // How? Because the function needs to return the next token\n            // So, perhaps we need to call nextToken() again\n            // But that could cause an infinite loop if not handled properly\n            // Alternatively, we can set t to null and let the function continue processing\n            t = null;\n        } else {\n            includedTokens.put(value, t);\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but if t is set to null, the function will proceed to return _nextToken2(), which might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should not return the token if it's already in the map, and instead continue processing.\n\nBut modifying the code in this way could be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HashMap should be checked before including the token in the output. So, in the case where the token is to be included, we first check if it's already present. If yes, we do not include it, and let the function proceed to the next token.\n\nSo, in the default case:\n\nif ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) || (f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n    String value = delegate.getText();\n    if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n        // Do not include this token\n        // So, do not return it, and proceed to next token\n        // So, set t to null so that the function continues\n        t = null;\n    } else {\n        includedTokens.put(value, t);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, in the code, after this condition, if it's not met, the function breaks and proceeds to return _nextToken2(). So, perhaps in the case where the token is to be included but is a duplicate, we set t to null, and then proceed to call _nextToken2().\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps after including the token, we add it to the map, and then return it. If it's a duplicate, we don't add it and instead continue processing.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the token to the map only once, and when a duplicate is found, skip it.\n\nSo, in the code, when the token is to be included, we check the map:\n\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL || f.includeValue(delegate)) {\n    String value = delegate.getText();\n    if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n        // Skip this token\n        // So, do not return it, and proceed to next token\n        // So, we need to call nextToken() again\n        // But how? Because the function is already processing this token.\n        // Maybe we can set t to null and let the function proceed.\n        t = null;\n    } else {\n        includedTokens.put(value, t);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n\nBut setting t to null would cause the function to return null, which might not be correct because there might be more tokens to process.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, after the switch statement, if t is not null, it's returned. If t is null, the function proceeds to return _nextToken2().\n\nSo, perhaps in the case where the token is a duplicate, we set t to null, and then the function will call _nextToken2(), which will get the next token.\n\nBut wait, in the default case, t is the current token, which is a scalar. So, if we set t to null, the function will not return it, and proceed to call _nextToken2(), which would process the next token.\n\nBut that might not be correct, because the current token is being skipped, but the next token is being processed. So, perhaps the function would correctly move to the next token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should continue processing the current token until it finds one that is not a duplicate.\n\nBut this could get complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to modify the code so that when a token is to be included, it's only added once. So, in the case where the token's value is already in the map, the function does not return it and instead continues to the next token.\n\nSo, in the default case:\n\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL || (f != null && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n    String value = delegate.getText();\n    if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n        // Do not include this token; proceed to next token\n        t = null;\n    } else {\n        includedTokens.put(value, t);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\n\nBut then, after this, if t is null, the function proceeds to return _nextToken2(), which would get the next token.\n\nWait, but in the code, after the switch statement, if t is not null, it's returned. So, if t is set to null, the function will proceed to return _nextToken2().\n\nSo, in the case where the token is a duplicate, t becomes null, and the function calls _nextToken2(), which would process the next token.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct approach, because the function may end up skipping tokens that should be included.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should not set t to null, but instead continue processing the next token in the loop.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to check the HashMap before including the token. So, in the case where the token is to be included, but it's a duplicate, we do not include it, and instead let the function proceed to the next token.\n\nSo, in the default case, after determining that the token should be included, we check the HashMap. If it's a duplicate, we break out of the switch and proceed to return _nextToken2().\n\nWait, but in the code, after the switch, if t is not null, it's returned. So, perhaps in the case where the token is a duplicate, we set t to null, and then the function proceeds to call _nextToken2().\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndefault: // scalar value\n    f = _itemFilter;\n    if (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n        String value = delegate.getText();\n        if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n            t = null;\n        } else {\n            includedTokens.put(value, t);\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    }\n    if (f != null) {\n        f = _headContext.checkValue(f);\n        if ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) || (f != null && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n            String value = delegate.getText();\n            if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n                t = null;\n            } else {\n                includedTokens.put(value, t);\n                return (_currToken = t);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // Otherwise not included (leaves must be explicitly included)\n    break;\n\nBut wait, in the case where f is TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL, the code would check the HashMap. If the value is already present, t is set to null, and the function proceeds to return _nextToken2().\n\nBut what about other cases where f is not INCLUDE_ALL? For example, when f.includeValue(delegate) returns true, but the value is already in the map.\n\nSo, the code should handle both cases.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the HashMap should be reset when the context changes, such as when an array or object starts or ends. Because, for example, in an array, each element is a separate context, and duplicates within the array should be handled, but duplicates across different arrays or objects might be allowed.\n\nWait, but the original issue is about multiple matches not being allowed, so perhaps the HashMap should be maintained across the entire parsing process, unless the context dictates that duplicates are allowed in certain scopes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HashMap should be per-context, so that each nested array or object has its own set of included tokens.\n\nThis complicates things, but perhaps for the scope of this fix, we can assume that the disallowing of multiple matches is at the top level, and the HashMap is a single instance.\n\nBut that might not be correct, as nested structures might have their own rules.\n\nHmm, perhaps the fix needs to track included tokens within the current context. So, each context (like an array or object) has its own set of included token names.\n\nSo, perhaps the TokenFilterContext should have a map of included token names. When entering a new context (like an array or object), a new map is created, and when exiting, the map is discarded.\n\nBut that would require modifying the TokenFilterContext class, which might be beyond the current scope.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the initial fix can be to use a single HashMap at the top level, and only track scalar values. But this might not cover all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only with the scalar values in the top-level array, so the fix can be applied there.\n\nBut given the provided code, perhaps the fix is to add a HashMap to track the included scalar values, and in the default case, before including a scalar, check if it's already present.\n\nSo, adding a HashMap as a field:\n\nprivate Map<String, JsonToken> includedTokens = new HashMap<>();\n\nThen, in the default case:\n\ndefault: // scalar value\n    f = _itemFilter;\n    if (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n        String value = delegate.getText();\n        if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n            t = null;\n        } else {\n            includedTokens.put(value, t);\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    }\n    if (f != null) {\n        f = _headContext.checkValue(f);\n        if ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) || (f != null && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n            String value = delegate.getText();\n            if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n                t = null;\n            } else {\n                includedTokens.put(value, t);\n                return (_currToken = t);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // Otherwise not included (leaves must be explicitly included)\n    break;\n\nBut wait, this would prevent any duplicate scalar values from being included, regardless of their context. So, if the same value appears in different objects or arrays, it would still be considered a duplicate, which might not be intended.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the issue is when multiple matches are not allowed, so perhaps this is the desired behavior.\n\nAnother consideration is that when the context changes (like entering a new array or object), the includedTokens map should be reset. Otherwise, duplicates across different contexts would be incorrectly skipped.\n\nSo, perhaps the includedTokens map should be managed per context. Each time a new context is entered (like an array or object), a new map is created, and when the context is exited, the map is merged or reset.\n\nBut this would require changes to the TokenFilterContext class, which might not be feasible in this fix.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the initial fix is to implement the HashMap at the top level, and only track scalar values. Then, when a scalar is included, it's added to the map, and duplicates are skipped.\n\nBut this might not handle all cases correctly, especially when nested structures are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only with the top-level array, and the fix can proceed as such.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the HashMap should be cleared when the filtering is reset, such as when the stream is closed or a new filtering operation begins.\n\nBut for now, perhaps the fix is to add the HashMap and check it in the default case.\n\nSo, in the code, I'll add the includedTokens map as a field.\n\nThen, in the default case, after determining that the token should be included, I'll check if the value is already in the map. If yes, set t to null. If no, add it to the map and return it.\n\nSo, the code in the default case becomes:\n\ndefault: // scalar value\n    f = _itemFilter;\n    if (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n        String value = delegate.getText();\n        if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n            t = null;\n        } else {\n            includedTokens.put(value, t);\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    }\n    if (f != null) {\n        f = _headContext.checkValue(f);\n        if ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) || (f != null && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n            String value = delegate.getText();\n            if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n                t = null;\n            } else {\n                includedTokens.put(value, t);\n                return (_currToken = t);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // Otherwise not included (leaves must be explicitly included)\n    break;\n\nBut wait, in the code, after the switch, if t is not null, it's returned. So, if t is null, the function proceeds to return _nextToken2().\n\nSo, in the case where the token is a duplicate, t is set to null, and the function calls _nextToken2(), which would process the next token.\n\nBut what if the next token is also a duplicate? It would be skipped as well, until a non-duplicate is found.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nBut I also need to handle the case where _allowMultipleMatches is true. In that case, the HashMap should not be used, and all tokens should be included as per the filter.\n\nSo, the check should only be performed when _allowMultipleMatches is false.\n\nSo, I need to modify the code to only perform the duplicate check when _allowMultipleMatches is false.\n\nSo, in the default case:\n\nif (_allowMultipleMatches == false) {\n    // perform the duplicate check\n    String value = delegate.getText();\n    if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n        t = null;\n    } else {\n        includedTokens.put(value, t);\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n} else {\n    // include the token without checking\n    return (_currToken = t);\n}\n\nWait, but this needs to be integrated into the existing logic.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be:\n\ndefault: // scalar value\n    f = _itemFilter;\n    boolean includeToken = false;\n    if (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n        includeToken = true;\n    } else if (f != null) {\n        f = _headContext.checkValue(f);\n        if (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL || (f != null && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n            includeToken = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (includeToken) {\n        if (!_allowMultipleMatches) {\n            String value = delegate.getText();\n            if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n                // Do not include this token\n                t = null;\n            } else {\n                includedTokens.put(value, t);\n                return (_currToken = t);\n            }\n        } else {\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    }\n    // Otherwise not included (leaves must be explicitly included)\n    break;\n\nWait, but this would require restructuring the code a bit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nIn the default case:\n\nf = _itemFilter;\nif (f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) {\n    // Token is to be included\n    if (!_allowMultipleMatches) {\n        String value = delegate.getText();\n        if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n            t = null;\n        } else {\n            includedTokens.put(value, t);\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    } else {\n        return (_currToken = t);\n    }\n}\nif (f != null) {\n    f = _headContext.checkValue(f);\n    if ((f == TokenFilter.INCLUDE_ALL) || (f != null && f.includeValue(delegate))) {\n        // Token is to be included\n        if (!_allowMultipleMatches) {\n            String value = delegate.getText();\n            if (includedTokens.containsKey(value)) {\n                t = null;\n            } else {\n                includedTokens.put(value, t);\n                return (_currToken = t);\n            }\n        } else {\n            return (_currToken = t);\n        }\n    }\n}\n// Otherwise not included (leaves must be explicitly included)\nbreak;\n\nThis way, the duplicate check is only performed when _allowMultipleMatches is false.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code in the default case would have the duplicate check.\n\nAdditionally, I need to make sure that the includedTokens map is properly managed. For example, when the context changes (like entering a new array or object), the map should be reset or managed per context.\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, this might require changes to the TokenFilterContext class, which might be beyond the current fix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the includedTokens map should be cleared when the context is reset, such as when _exposedContext is set to null.\n\nBut in the current code, when _exposedContext is null, the function proceeds to read more tokens from the delegate.\n\nSo, perhaps when _exposedContext is null, the includedTokens map should be cleared, as a new context is starting.\n\nSo, in the code, after the initial if (ctxt != null) block, when _exposedContext is set to null, we can clear the includedTokens map.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nif (ctxt != null) {\n    // process buffered tokens\n} else {\n    // read more tokens from delegate\n}\n\nSo, perhaps when ctxt is null, it's the top-level context, and the includedTokens map should be reset.\n\nSo, perhaps after the if (ctxt != null) block, before reading the next token from delegate, we can check if includedTokens needs to be reset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the includedTokens map should be cleared when the context is reset.\n\nBut without more information on how the context is managed, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the initial fix is to implement the HashMap and the duplicate check in the default case, as described.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Add a private HashMap includedTokens as a field.\n\n2. In the default case, after determining that the token should be included, check if _allowMultipleMatches is false.\n\n3. If so, get the token's value, check if it's in includedTokens.\n\n4. If it is, set t to null, so the function proceeds to _nextToken2().\n\n5. If not, add it to includedTokens and return the token.\n\n6. Also, when the context is reset (like when _exposedContext is null), clear the includedTokens map.\n\nBut where to clear it?\n\nLooking at the code, when ctxt is null, the function reads the next token from delegate. So, perhaps"
