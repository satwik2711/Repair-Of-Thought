      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the _narrow function is not correctly checking if the subclass is a subtype of the current class. This is causing the deserialization process to fail when trying to deserialize a field that is not present in the current class. The TODO comment in the code suggests that this issue was known but not fixed in version 2.8.\nSuggestion: Implement Subclass Relationship Check\nWe can implement a subclass relationship check in the _narrow function to ensure that the subclass is a subtype of the current class. This can be done by using the isAssignableFrom method in Java. If the subclass is not a subtype of the current class, we can throw an IllegalArgumentException. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass) {\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    if (!_class.isAssignableFrom(subclass)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \" + subclass.getName() + \" not sub-type of \" + _class.getName());\n    }\n    return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces, _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass)\n{\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    // Should we check that there is a sub-class relationship?\n    // 15-Jan-2016, tatu: Almost yes, but there are some complications with\n    //    placeholder values (`Void`, `NoClass`), so can not quite do yet.\n    // TODO: fix in 2.8\n        /*\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \"+subclass.getName()+\" not sub-type of \"\n                +_class.getName());\n                */\n        return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces,\n                _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n    // Otherwise, stitch together the hierarchy. First, super-class\n    // if not found, try a super-interface\n    // should not get here but...\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is causing the deserialization process to fail when trying to deserialize a field that is not present in the current class. The TODO comment in the code suggests that this issue was known but not fixed in version 2.8.\nSuggestion: Use a More Robust Type Checking Mechanism\nWe can use a more robust type checking mechanism, such as the TypeFactory.findTypeParameters method, to check if the subclass is a subtype of the current class. This method can handle more complex type relationships and can provide more accurate results. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass) {\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    TypeFactory tf = TypeFactory.defaultInstance();\n    JavaType type = tf.constructType(_class);\n    if (!type.isTypeOrSubTypeOf(subclass)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \" + subclass.getName() + \" not sub-type of \" + _class.getName());\n    }\n    return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces, _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass)\n{\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    // Should we check that there is a sub-class relationship?\n    // 15-Jan-2016, tatu: Almost yes, but there are some complications with\n    //    placeholder values (`Void`, `NoClass`), so can not quite do yet.\n    // TODO: fix in 2.8\n        /*\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \"+subclass.getName()+\" not sub-type of \"\n                +_class.getName());\n                */\n        return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces,\n                _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n    // Otherwise, stitch together the hierarchy.

This can be done by setting the ignoreUnknownProperties property to true in the ObjectMapper. However, this may not be the best solution as it can lead to data loss during deserialization. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nmapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false);\n```\n// Buggy Function\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass)\n{\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    // Should we check that there is a sub-class relationship?\n    // 15-Jan-2016, tatu: Almost yes, but there are some complications with\n    //    placeholder values (`Void`, `NoClass`), so can not quite do yet.\n    // TODO: fix in 2.8\n        /*\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \"+subclass.getName()+\" not sub-type of \"\n                +_class.getName());\n                */\n        return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces,\n                _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n    // Otherwise, stitch together the hierarchy.
