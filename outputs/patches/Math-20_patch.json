      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `repairAndDecode` function is not properly repairing the optimized result to ensure it is within the specified bounds. The function is simply calling the `decode` function without any bounds checking or repair logic. This is causing the optimized result to exceed the upper bound, leading to the assertion failure.\nSuggestion: Simple Bounds Checking\nOne possible fix is to add simple bounds checking to the `repairAndDecode` function. We can check if the optimized result is within the specified bounds and if not, adjust it to the nearest bound. Here's an example of how the modified function could look:\n```java\npublic double[] repairAndDecode(final double[] x, final double[] lower, final double[] upper) {\n    double[] result = decode(x);\n    for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {\n        if (result[i] < lower[i]) {\n            result[i] = lower[i];\n        } else if (result[i] > upper[i]) {\n            result[i] = upper[i];\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, but it may not be suitable for all cases, especially if the optimized result is far outside the bounds.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double[] repairAndDecode(final double[] x) {\n    return\n        decode(x);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function is simply calling the `decode` function without any bounds checking or repair logic. This is causing the optimized result to exceed the upper bound, leading to the assertion failure.\nSuggestion: Proportional Repair\nAnother possible fix is to use a proportional repair approach. Instead of simply adjusting the optimized result to the nearest bound, we can proportionally adjust it based on the distance from the bound. Here's an example of how the modified function could look:\n```java\npublic double[] repairAndDecode(final double[] x, final double[] lower, final double[] upper) {\n    double[] result = decode(x);\n    for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {\n        if (result[i] < lower[i]) {\n            result[i] = lower[i] + (result[i] - lower[i]) * 0.5;\n        } else if (result[i] > upper[i]) {\n            result[i] = upper[i] - (result[i] - upper[i]) * 0.5;\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis fix is more sophisticated than the simple bounds checking approach, but it may still not be suitable for all cases.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double[] repairAndDecode(final double[] x) {\n    return\n        decode(x);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function is simply calling the `decode` function without any bounds checking or repair logic. This is causing the optimized result to exceed the upper bound, leading to the assertion failure.\nSuggestion: Reflection Repair\nA third possible fix is to use a reflection repair approach. Instead of adjusting the optimized result, we can reflect it around the bound. Here's an example of how the modified function could look:\n```java\npublic double[] repairAndDecode(final double[] x, final double[] lower, final double[] upper) {\n    double[] result = decode(x);\n    for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {\n        if (result[i] < lower[i]) {\n            result[i] = lower[i] - (result[i] - lower[i]);\n        } else if (result[i] > upper[i]) {\n            result[i] = upper[i] - (result[i] - upper[i]);\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis fix is more aggressive than the previous two approaches, but it may be more effective in certain cases.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double[] repairAndDecode(final double[] x) {\n    return\n        decode(x);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
