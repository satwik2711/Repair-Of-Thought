      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the function `getPct(Object v)` is calling `getCumPct((Comparable<?>) v)`, which is not the correct method to call in this case. The `getCumPct` method is supposed to return the cumulative percentage of values less than or equal to the given value, not the percentage of values equal to the given value. This is why the function is returning an incorrect percentage for the input `(Object) (Integer.valueOf(3))`.\nSuggestion: Implement a Separate Method to Count Occurrences\nImplement a separate method that counts the occurrences of the given value and divides it by the total number of values. This method can then be called from `getPct(Object v)`. Here is the corrected code:\n```java\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n    int count = 0;\n    int total = 0;\n    for (Object obj : values) {\n        if (obj.equals(v)) {\n            count++;\n        }\n        total++;\n    }\n    return (double) count / total;\n}\n```\nThis solution is efficient, easy to implement, and correctly handles the case where the given value is an `Integer` object.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n    return getCumPct((Comparable<?>) v);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is why the function is returning an incorrect percentage for the input `(Object) (Integer.valueOf(3))`.\nSuggestion: Modify `getCumPct` to Handle Equality\nModify the `getCumPct` method to handle the case where the given value is equal to the values in the frequency list. This can be done by adding a special case to the method that checks for equality and returns the correct percentage. However, this solution may be more complex and harder to implement than the first suggestion.\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n    return getCumPct((Comparable<?>) v);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This would allow for correct comparison of values even if they are of different types. However, this solution may not work correctly if the values are not comparable, and it may also be less efficient than the first suggestion.\n\n\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"}\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getPct(Object v) {\n    return getCumPct((Comparable<?>) v);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
