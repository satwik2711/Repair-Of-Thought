      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `solve` function is not using the provided `f` function and instead calls itself recursively with only `min` and `max` parameters, leading to a loss of the `f` function reference and causing a `NullPointerException` when trying to access it.\nSuggestion: Correctly Call the Recursive Function\nThe `solve` function should call itself recursively with the correct parameters, including the `f` function. However, this solution assumes that the `solve` function with five parameters is correctly implemented, which is not shown in the provided code. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    return solve(f, min, max, initial, getAbsoluteAccuracy());\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    return solve(min, max);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    double a = min;\n    double b = max;\n    double fa = f.value(a);\n    double fb = f.value(b);\n    if (fa * fb > 0) {\n        throw new FunctionEvaluationException(\"The function must have different signs at the endpoints of the interval.\");\n    }\n    while (b - a > getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n        double c = (a + b) / 2;\n        double fc = f.value(c);\n        if (fc * fa < 0) {\n            b = c;\n            fb = fc;\n        } else {\n            a = c;\n            fa = fc;\n        }\n    }\n    return (a + b) / 2;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    return solve(min, max);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    return f.value(initial);\n}\n```\nHowever, this solution is a very basic implementation and may not be suitable for all cases.
