      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `_bindAsTree` method is returning a `MissingNode` when the input is empty, instead of `null`. This is because the `_bindAsTree` method is not checking for the end-of-input condition and is returning a `MissingNode` by default.\nSuggestion: Check for End-of-Input Condition\nWe can add a check for the end-of-input condition in the `readTree` method. If the input is empty, we can return `null` immediately. Otherwise, we can call the `_bindAsTree` method as before. This solution is simple and effective, and it fixes the bug without introducing any new issues.\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n    if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.END_OF_INPUT) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    return (T) _bindAsTree(p);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    @Override\n    public <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n        return (T) _bindAsTree(p);\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the `_bindAsTree` method is not checking for the end-of-input condition and is returning a `MissingNode` by default.\nSuggestion: Modify _bindAsTree Method\nWe can modify the `_bindAsTree` method to return `null` when the input is empty. This would require adding a check for the end-of-input condition in the `_bindAsTree` method. However, this solution may be more complex and may require additional changes to the `_bindAsTree` method.\n\n```java\nprivate <T extends TreeNode> T _bindAsTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n    if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.END_OF_INPUT) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    // existing code\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    @Override\n    public <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n        return (T) _bindAsTree(p);\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the `_bindAsTree` method is not checking for the end-of-input condition and is returning a `MissingNode` by default.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Method\nWe can use a different method to bind the content as a JSON tree. For example, we can use the `readValue` method with a `JsonNode` type parameter. This would allow us to avoid the issue with the `_bindAsTree` method. However, this solution may require additional changes to the surrounding code and may not be as efficient as the other solutions.\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n    return (T) MAPPER.readTree(p);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n    @Override\n    public <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n        return (T) _bindAsTree(p);\n    }\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
