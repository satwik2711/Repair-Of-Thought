      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the function `handleBlockComment` only checks for '/* @' or '\\n * @' at the beginning of the comment value. However, in the trigger test, the '@type {number}' is not at the beginning of the comment value, but rather on a new line. This means that the function is not correctly identifying the JSDoc comment.\nSuggestion: Check for '@' symbol anywhere in the comment value\nInstead of only checking for '/* @' or '\\n * @' at the beginning of the comment value, we can check for the '@' symbol anywhere in the comment value. This can be done by using the `indexOf` method without specifying a starting index. However, this approach may also match non-JSDoc comments that contain the '@' symbol.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void handleBlockComment(Comment comment) {\n  if (comment.getValue().indexOf(\"/* @\") != -1 || comment.getValue().indexOf(\"\\n * @\") != -1) {\n    errorReporter.warning(\n        SUSPICIOUS_COMMENT_WARNING,\n        sourceName,\n        comment.getLineno(), \"\", 0);\n  }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

However, in the trigger test, the '@type {number}' is not at the beginning of the comment value, but rather on a new line.

This would allow us to correctly identify JSDoc comments even when the '@' symbol is not at the beginning of the comment value.
