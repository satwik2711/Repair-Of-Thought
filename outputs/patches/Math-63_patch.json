      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `equals()` function is using the `==` operator to compare the input values, which is not correct for NaN values. In Java, `Double.NaN` is not equal to itself when compared using the `==` operator. Instead, the `Double.isNaN()` method should be used to check if a value is NaN.\nSuggestion: Using Double.isNaN() for NaN Comparison\nOne possible fix is to use the `Double.isNaN()` method to check if either of the input values is NaN, and if so, return true if both values are NaN. Here's the modified code:\n```java\npublic static boolean equals(double x, double y) {\n    return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || (x == y);\n}\n```\nThis fix correctly handles NaN values by using the `Double.isNaN()` method to check if a value is NaN.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean equals(double x, double y) {\n    return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || x == y;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
