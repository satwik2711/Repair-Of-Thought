      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue arises from the calculation of the new buffer length in the `expandCurrentSegment` method. When the current buffer length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`, the new length is set to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN + 1`, which is incorrect because it does not actually increase the buffer size. This is due to the fact that the `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` is likely a power of 2 (262144 in this case), and adding 1 to it does not change the buffer size when copying the array using `Arrays.copyOf`.\nSuggestion: Increase Buffer Size by a Fixed Amount\nIncrease the buffer size by a fixed amount (e.g., 1024) when the current length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`. This ensures that the buffer size always increases, even when the current length is close to the maximum segment length. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] expandCurrentSegment()\n{\n    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;\n    final int len = curr.length;\n    int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ? (MAX_SEGMENT_LEN + 1024) : Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len + (len >> 1));\n    return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, newLen));\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic char[] expandCurrentSegment()\n{\n    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;\n    // Let's grow by 50% by default\n    final int len = curr.length;\n    // but above intended maximum, slow to increase by 25%\n    int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ?

This approach ensures that the buffer size increases rapidly, even when the current length is close to the maximum segment length. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] expandCurrentSegment()\n{\n    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;\n    final int len = curr.length;\n    int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ?
