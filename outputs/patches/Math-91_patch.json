      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `compareTo` function is using a simple comparison of the double values of the fractions, which can lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues. The function is not correctly handling cases where the fractions are approximately equal.\nSuggestion: Using a Tolerance for Comparison\nOne possible fix is to use a tolerance when comparing the double values of the fractions. This can be done by checking if the absolute difference between the two values is less than a certain threshold. If it is, we can consider the fractions to be equal. The modified `compareTo` function would be:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = doubleValue();\n    double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n    double tolerance = 1.0e-20;\n    if (Math.abs(nOd - dOn) < tolerance) {\n        return 0;\n    } else {\n        return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = doubleValue();\n    double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n    return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function is not correctly handling cases where the fractions are approximately equal.\nSuggestion: Using a More Precise Comparison Method\nAnother possible fix is to use a more precise comparison method, such as comparing the fractions using their numerator and denominator values instead of their double values. This can be done by using a method such as `compareCrossProduct`. The modified `compareTo` function would be:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long crossProduct = getNumerator() * object.getDenominator() - getDenominator() * object.getNumerator();\n    if (crossProduct < 0) {\n        return -1;\n    } else if (crossProduct > 0) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = doubleValue();\n    double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n    return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function is not correctly handling cases where the fractions are approximately equal.\nSuggestion: Rounding the Double Values\nA third possible fix is to round the double values of the fractions to a certain number of decimal places before comparing them. This can help to reduce the effect of floating-point precision issues. The modified `compareTo` function would be:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = round(doubleValue(), 20);\n    double dOn = round(object.doubleValue(), 20);\n    return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n\nprivate double round(double value, int decimalPlaces) {\n    double multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = doubleValue();\n    double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n    return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
