Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug appears to be related to the verification logic in the buggy function. Specifically, the issue arises when the verification mode is not null, and the mock object being verified is not the same as the mock object that was used to set up the verification mode. In this case, the function is not correctly handling the verification, leading to the assertion error.\nSuggestion: Modify Verification Mode Handling\nOne potential fix is to modify the way the verification mode is handled in the buggy function. Instead of checking if the verification mode is not null, we can check if the verification mode is an instance of MockAwareVerificationMode, and if so, we can use the getMock() method to get the correct mock object to verify. This will ensure that the correct mock object is being verified, even if it's not the same as the mock object that was used to set up the verification mode.\n\n```java\nif (verificationMode instanceof MockAwareVerificationMode) {\n    Mock mock = ((MockAwareVerificationMode) verificationMode).getMock();\n    if (mock == invocation.getMock()) {\n        VerificationDataImpl data = new VerificationDataImpl(invocationContainerImpl, invocationMatcher);\n        verificationMode.verify(data);\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object handle(Invocation invocation) throws Throwable {\n    if (invocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing()) {\n        // stubbing voids with stubVoid() or doAnswer() style\n        InvocationMatcher invocationMatcher = matchersBinder.bindMatchers(mockingProgress\n                        .getArgumentMatcherStorage(), invocation);\n        invocationContainerImpl.setMethodForStubbing(invocationMatcher);\n        return null;\n    }\n    VerificationMode verificationMode = mockingProgress.pullVerificationMode();\n\n    InvocationMatcher invocationMatcher = matchersBinder.bindMatchers(mockingProgress.getArgumentMatcherStorage(),\n                    invocation);\n\n    mockingProgress.validateState();\n\n    //if verificationMode is not null then someone is doing verify()        \n    if (verificationMode != null) {\n        //We need to check if verification was started on the correct mock \n        // - see VerifyingWithAnExtraCallToADifferentMockTest (bug 138)\n        if (verificationMode instanceof MockAwareVerificationMode && ((MockAwareVerificationMode) verificationMode).getMock() == invocation.getMock()) {                \n            VerificationDataImpl data = new VerificationDataImpl(invocationContainerImpl, invocationMatcher);            \n            verificationMode.verify(data);\n            return null;\n            // this means there is an invocation on a different mock.
