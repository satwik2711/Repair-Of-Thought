      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The getBasicRow function is not correctly identifying the basic row for a given column. This is because the function is iterating over the rows starting from the number of objective functions, but it should start from the first row. Additionally, the function is returning null if the column is not basic, but it should return the row that the variable is basic in, or null if the column is not basic in any row.\nSuggestion: Fix the Iteration Range\nThe getBasicRow function should iterate over all rows, not just the rows starting from the number of objective functions. This can be fixed by changing the loop condition to start from 0 instead of getNumObjectiveFunctions(). The corrected function would be:\nprivate Integer getBasicRow(final int col) {\n    Integer row = null;\n    for (int i = 0; i < getHeight(); i++) {\n        if (!MathUtils.equals(getEntry(i, col), 0.0, epsilon)) {\n            if (row == null) {\n                row = i;\n            } else {\n                return null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return row;\n}\n// Buggy Function\nprivate Integer getBasicRow(final int col) {\n    Integer row = null;\n    for (int i = getNumObjectiveFunctions(); i < getHeight(); i++) {\n        if (!MathUtils.equals(getEntry(i, col), 0.0, epsilon)) {\n            if (row == null) {\n            row = i;\n            } else {\n            return null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return row;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Additionally, the function is returning null if the column is not basic, but it should return the row that the variable is basic in, or null if the column is not basic in any row.\nSuggestion: Simplify the Function\nThe getBasicRow function can be simplified by removing the unnecessary null check and directly returning the row that the variable is basic in, or null if the column is not basic in any row.
