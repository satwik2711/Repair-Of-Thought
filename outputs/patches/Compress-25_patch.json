      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `PushbackInputStream` is not being properly initialized with the correct buffer size. The `buf.capacity()` method is being used to get the capacity of the buffer, but this method returns the current capacity of the buffer, not the maximum capacity. As a result, the `PushbackInputStream` is being initialized with a buffer size that is too small, causing the contents of the entry to be truncated.\nSuggestion: Increase Buffer Size to a Fixed Value\nOne possible fix is to increase the buffer size used to initialize the `PushbackInputStream`. This can be done by replacing the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());` with `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, 1024);`. This will increase the buffer size to 1024 bytes, which should be sufficient to hold the contents of the entry.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ZipArchiveInputStream(InputStream inputStream,\n                             String encoding,\n                             boolean useUnicodeExtraFields,\n                             boolean allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor) {\n    zipEncoding = ZipEncodingHelper.getZipEncoding(encoding);\n    this.useUnicodeExtraFields = useUnicodeExtraFields;\n    in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());\n    this.allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor =\n        allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor;\n    // haven't read anything so far\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

As a result, the `PushbackInputStream` is being initialized with a buffer size that is too small, causing the contents of the entry to be truncated.\nSuggestion: Use a Larger Buffer Size\nAnother possible fix is to use a larger buffer to initialize the `PushbackInputStream`. This can be done by replacing the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());` with `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, 4096);`. This will increase the buffer size to 4096 bytes, which should be sufficient to hold the contents of the entry.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ZipArchiveInputStream(InputStream inputStream,\n                             String encoding,\n                             boolean useUnicodeExtraFields,\n                             boolean allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor) {\n    zipEncoding = ZipEncodingHelper.getZipEncoding(encoding);\n    this.useUnicodeExtraFields = useUnicodeExtraFields;\n    in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());\n    this.allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor =\n        allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor;\n    // haven't read anything so far\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

As a result, the `PushbackInputStream` is being initialized with a buffer size that is too small, causing the contents of the entry to be truncated.\nSuggestion: Use a Dynamic Buffer Size Based on Entry Size\nA third possible fix is to use a dynamic buffer size that is based on the size of the entry. This can be done by replacing the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());` with `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, ze.getSize());`. This will set the buffer size to the size of the entry, which should ensure that the contents of the entry are not truncated.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ZipArchiveInputStream(InputStream inputStream,\n                             String encoding,\n                             boolean useUnicodeExtraFields,\n                             boolean allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor) {\n    zipEncoding = ZipEncodingHelper.getZipEncoding(encoding);\n    this.useUnicodeExtraFields = useUnicodeExtraFields;\n    in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());\n    this.allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor =\n        allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor;\n    // haven't read anything so far\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
