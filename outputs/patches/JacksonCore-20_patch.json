      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `writeEmbeddedObject` method is not implemented to handle embedded objects, and instead throws a `JsonGenerationException` with a message indicating that there is no native support for writing embedded objects. This is because the method is not designed to handle null objects or other types of objects, and instead relies on the caller to handle these cases.\nSuggestion: Implement Null Handling\nOne possible fix is to implement null handling in the `writeEmbeddedObject` method. This could involve checking if the input object is null, and if so, writing 'null' to the output instead of throwing an exception. This would allow the method to handle null objects correctly, and would fix the bug.\n\n```java\npublic void writeEmbeddedObject(Object object) throws IOException {\n    if (object == null) {\n        writeNull();\n    } else {\n        throw new JsonGenerationException(\"No native support for writing embedded objects\", this);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic void writeEmbeddedObject(Object object) throws IOException {\n    // 01-Sep-2016, tatu: As per [core#318], handle small number of cases\n    throw new JsonGenerationException(\"No native support for writing embedded objects\",\n            this);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the method is not designed to handle null objects or other types of objects, and instead relies on the caller to handle these cases.\nSuggestion: Implement Embedded Object Handling\nAnother possible fix is to implement embedded object handling in the `writeEmbeddedObject` method. This could involve checking if the input object is an instance of a specific class, and if so, writing the object's contents to the output instead of throwing an exception. This would allow the method to handle embedded objects correctly, and would fix the bug.\n\n```java\npublic void writeEmbeddedObject(Object object) throws IOException {\n    if (object instanceof EmbeddedObject) {\n        writeEmbeddedObject((EmbeddedObject) object);\n    } else {\n        throw new JsonGenerationException(\"No native support for writing embedded objects\", this);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void writeEmbeddedObject(EmbeddedObject object) throws IOException {\n    // implement writing the object's contents to the output\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic void writeEmbeddedObject(Object object) throws IOException {\n    // 01-Sep-2016, tatu: As per [core#318], handle small number of cases\n    throw new JsonGenerationException(\"No native support for writing embedded objects\",\n            this);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the method is not designed to handle null objects or other types of objects, and instead relies on the caller to handle these cases.\nSuggestion: Throw a More Informative Exception\nA third possible fix is to throw a more informative exception from the `writeEmbeddedObject` method. This could involve checking if the input object is null or an instance of a specific class, and if so, throwing a more informative exception that indicates the reason for the failure. This would allow the caller to handle the exception more effectively, and would fix the bug.\n\n```java\npublic void writeEmbeddedObject(Object object) throws IOException {\n    if (object == null) {\n        throw new JsonGenerationException(\"Null object cannot be written as an embedded object\", this);\n    } else if (object instanceof EmbeddedObject) {\n        throw new JsonGenerationException(\"Embedded objects are not supported\", this);\n    } else {\n        throw new JsonGenerationException(\"No native support for writing embedded objects\", this);\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic void writeEmbeddedObject(Object object) throws IOException {\n    // 01-Sep-2016, tatu: As per [core#318], handle small number of cases\n    throw new JsonGenerationException(\"No native support for writing embedded objects\",\n            this);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
