      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is in the line 'mant = str.substring(0, expPos);'. When the function encounters a string like '1eE', it tries to find the index of 'e' or 'E' in the string. However, since there are two 'e's in the string, the function gets confused and tries to access an index that is out of range, resulting in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.\nSuggestion: Check for Multiple 'e's\nWe can add a check for multiple 'e's before trying to find the index of 'e' or 'E'. If the string contains multiple 'e's, we can throw a NumberFormatException with a message indicating that the string is not a valid number. This can be implemented by adding the following code before the line 'int expPos = str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1;':\n```java\nif (str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e') || str.indexOf('E') != str.lastIndexOf('E')) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, and it handles the root cause of the bug.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static Number createNumber(String str) throws NumberFormatException {\n    if (str == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    if (StringUtils.isBlank(str)) {\n        throw new NumberFormatException(\"A blank string is not a valid number\");\n    }  \n    if (str.startsWith(\"--\")) {\n        // this is protection for poorness in java.lang.BigDecimal.\n        // it accepts this as a legal value, but it does not appear \n        // to be in specification of class.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the provided createNumber function. The root cause is that when the string has multiple 'e's or 'E's, it causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. \n\nLooking at the original code, the problem occurs at the line where expPos is calculated. The current code does str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1. If there are multiple 'e's or 'E's, this might result in an incorrect position or even a negative value, leading to substring issues.\n\nThe suggested fix is to add a check before calculating expPos. We need to ensure that the string doesn't have multiple 'e's or 'E's. So, if either 'e' or 'E' occurs more than once, we throw a NumberFormatException.\n\nI'll add the check right before the line where expPos is declared. The condition will be: if the first index of 'e' is not equal to the last index of 'e', or the same for 'E', then throw an exception.\n\nWait, actually, the condition should check if there are multiple 'e's or multiple 'E's. So, if indexOf('e') != lastIndexOf('e'), that means there are multiple 'e's. Similarly for 'E'. So the condition is correct as per the suggestion.\n\nSo, I'll insert the code:\n\nif (str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e') || str.indexOf('E') != str.lastIndexOf('E')) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n\nThis should prevent cases where multiple exponent indicators are present.\n\nI also need to make sure that this check is placed before any operations that rely on expPos. So, right before the line where expPos is calculated.\n\nLet me look at the original code structure. The expPos is declared after checking for the decimal point. So, inserting the check just before that line makes sense.\n\nI should also test this change. For example, if the string is \"1eE\", the indexOf('e') is 1, lastIndexOf('e') is 2 (if the string is \"1eE\", wait no, \"1eE\" has 'e' at index 1 and 'E' at index 2. So indexOf('e') is 1, lastIndexOf('e') is 1 because 'E' is different. Wait, no, indexOf('e') looks for lowercase 'e's, and lastIndexOf('e') also looks for lowercase. Similarly for 'E's.\n\nWait, in the string \"1eE3\", the 'e's are at positions 1 and 2. So indexOf('e') is 1, lastIndexOf('e') is 1 because the second 'E' is uppercase. So the condition would be false for 'e's but true for 'E's because indexOf('E') is 2, lastIndexOf('E') is 2. So in this case, the condition would not trigger. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The string \"1eE3\" has 'e' at index 1 and 'E' at index 2. So str.indexOf('e') is 1, str.lastIndexOf('e') is 1 because it's looking for 'e's. Similarly, str.indexOf('E') is 2, str.lastIndexOf('E') is 2. So the condition (str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e')) would be false because 1 == 1. Similarly for 'E's, 2 == 2. So the condition would not throw an exception, but the string is invalid because it has both 'e' and 'E', which is not allowed in a number.\n\nWait, but according to the Number format, the exponent can only have one 'e' or 'E', right? So having both is invalid. So the current check might not catch that case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial fix suggestion is insufficient because it only checks for multiple 'e's or multiple 'E's, but not a mix of both. So, for example, a string like \"1eE3\" would have one 'e' and one 'E', which is also invalid because the exponent can only be specified once, regardless of case.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should check if the total number of 'e's (both cases) is more than one. Alternatively, check if the string contains more than one 'e' or 'E' in any combination.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the expPos is calculated as indexOf('e') + indexOf('E') + 1. So if there are both 'e' and 'E', their indices would be added, which could result in a larger value. But that's incorrect because the exponent should only be specified once.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to check that the string contains at most one 'e' or 'E', regardless of case. So, if the count of 'e's (case-insensitive) is more than one, throw an exception.\n\nBut how to implement that? Because indexOf('e') gives the first occurrence, and lastIndexOf('e') gives the last. But if the string has 'e' and 'E', the indices would be different, but the count would be two.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of 'e's and 'E's. If the total is more than one, throw an exception.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint eCount = 0;\nfor (int i=0; i<str.length(); i++) {\n    if (Character.toLowerCase(str.charAt(i)) == 'e') {\n        eCount++;\n    }\n}\nif (eCount > 1) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(...);\n}\n\nBut that's more code. Alternatively, using a regular expression to check if the string contains more than one 'e' or 'E'.\n\nBut perhaps the initial fix is sufficient for the given bug, which is when the string has multiple 'e's or multiple 'E's. The case where it has one 'e' and one 'E' is another issue, but perhaps that's beyond the current bug scope.\n\nWait, the original bug was that when the string has two 'e's, like \"1eE\", the code throws an exception. So the initial fix addresses that case. But the case where it's \"1eE3\" would still be invalid, but perhaps that's a different issue.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial fix is sufficient for the problem described, but maybe the function should also handle the case where both 'e' and 'E' are present.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the root cause is when there are multiple 'e's or 'E's, so the fix is to check for that. So I'll proceed with the suggested fix.\n\nSo, in the code, I'll add the check before calculating expPos.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. After the initial checks (null, blank, starts with \"--\", 0x), before calculating expPos, add the check for multiple 'e's or 'E's.\n\n2. Insert the code:\n\nif (str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e') || str.indexOf('E') != str.lastIndexOf('E')) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n\n3. Then proceed to calculate expPos as before.\n\nWait, but in the original code, expPos is calculated as indexOf('e') + indexOf('E') + 1. That's incorrect because if both are present, their sum could be a large number, leading to incorrect substring positions.\n\nSo, perhaps after adding the check, we should find the exponent position correctly. Because after ensuring there's at most one 'e' or 'E', we can safely find the exponent.\n\nSo, perhaps after the check, we can find expPos as the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E', whichever comes first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expPos calculation should be modified to handle case insensitively.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's way of calculating expPos is incorrect. Because if the string has both 'e' and 'E', their indices are added, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct way is to find the first occurrence of either 'e' or 'E' and use that as the exponent position.\n\nSo, perhaps the expPos should be the minimum of indexOf('e') and indexOf('E'), but only if they are present.\n\nWait, no. Because if the string has 'E' but no 'e', then indexOf('e') returns -1, and adding them would be -1 + something.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's way of calculating expPos is flawed. Let me think about it.\n\nIn the original code:\n\nint expPos = str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1;\n\nThis is incorrect because if the string has both 'e' and 'E', their indices are added. For example, if 'e' is at position 2 and 'E' is at position 3, then expPos would be 2 + 3 +1 =6, which is beyond the string's length if it's shorter than that.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to find the position of 'e' or 'E', whichever comes first, but only one of them.\n\nSo, perhaps after the check, we can do:\n\nint ePos = str.indexOf('e');\nint EPos = str.indexOf('E');\nif (ePos != -1 && EPos != -1) {\n    // both present, which is invalid as per our check, but since we added the check, this won't happen\n    throw new NumberFormatException(...);\n} else if (ePos != -1) {\n    expPos = ePos;\n} else if (EPos != -1) {\n    expPos = EPos;\n} else {\n    expPos = -1;\n}\n\nBut wait, the check we added earlier ensures that there are no multiple 'e's or 'E's. So, after that, the string can have at most one 'e' or one 'E'.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to find the first occurrence of either 'e' or 'E' and set expPos to that.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nif (str.indexOf('e') > -1) {\n    expPos = str.indexOf('e');\n} else if (str.indexOf('E') > -1) {\n    expPos = str.indexOf('E');\n}\n\nBut wait, the original code adds 1 to the sum. So, perhaps the expPos is intended to be the position after the 'e' or 'E'. Because in the original code, when you have 'e', the substring starts after that.\n\nWait, looking back, in the original code, after getting expPos, it's used to split the string into mantissa and exponent. So, for example, in \"1e3\", expPos would be 1 (index of 'e') + (-1, since 'E' is not found) +1 =1 +0=1? Wait, no, because indexOf returns -1 if not found. So, 1 + (-1) +1 =1. So, expPos is 1.\n\nThen, when extracting the exponent, it's from expPos +1. So, in \"1e3\", exp is str.substring(1+1, ...), which is correct.\n\nBut if the string is \"1E3\", then indexOf('e') is -1, indexOf('E') is 1. So, expPos is (-1) +1 +1=1. So, same as before.\n\nWait, but if the string has both 'e' and 'E', like \"1eE3\", the original code would have expPos =1 +2 +1=4, which is beyond the string length, causing issues.\n\nBut with the added check, such cases would throw an exception before proceeding.\n\nSo, perhaps the original way of calculating expPos is incorrect and should be fixed. Because adding the indices is not the right approach.\n\nSo, perhaps after the check, we should correctly find the position of the exponent character.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after adding the check, I'll calculate expPos as the position of 'e' or 'E', whichever comes first.\n\nSo, I'll replace the line:\n\nint expPos = str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1;\n\nwith:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nif (str.indexOf('e') != -1) {\n    expPos = str.indexOf('e');\n} else if (str.indexOf('E') != -1) {\n    expPos = str.indexOf('E');\n}\nif (expPos != -1) {\n    expPos++; // because the exponent starts after 'e' or 'E'\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, expPos is set to the index of 'e' plus index of 'E' plus 1. So, in cases where both are present, it's incorrect. But with the check, we ensure that only one is present.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to set expPos to the index of 'e' or 'E' and then add 1 to it, as the exponent starts after that character.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = eIndex + 1;\n} else if (EIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = EIndex + 1;\n}\n\nBut wait, in the original code, expPos is used to split the string into mantissa and exponent. So, for \"1e3\", the mantissa is substring(0, expPos-1), because expPos is 1 (e's index) +1 =2. So, substring(0,2) is \"1e\", which is wrong. Wait, no, in the original code, when expPos is calculated as 1 + (-1) +1=1, then in the code:\n\nif (decPos > -1) {\n    if (expPos > -1) {\n        if (expPos < decPos) {\n            throw exception;\n        }\n        dec = substring(decPos+1, expPos);\n    } else {\n        dec = substring(decPos+1);\n    }\n    mant = substring(0, decPos);\n} else {\n    if (expPos > -1) {\n        mant = substring(0, expPos);\n    } else {\n        mant = str;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, in the original code, when expPos is 1 (for \"1e3\"), then in the else block (since decPos is -1), mant is substring(0,1), which is \"1\", and then exp is substring(1+1, ...) which is \"3\".\n\nSo, the original code expects expPos to be the index after 'e' or 'E'. So, in the fixed code, after the check, we should set expPos to the index of 'e' or 'E' plus 1.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after adding the check, I'll calculate expPos as:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = eIndex + 1;\n} else if (EIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = EIndex + 1;\n}\n\nThis way, expPos correctly points to the start of the exponent part.\n\nSo, to summarize, the steps are:\n\n1. Add the check for multiple 'e's or 'E's before calculating expPos.\n\n2. Correctly calculate expPos as the index after 'e' or 'E', whichever is present.\n\nI think this will fix the bug.\n\nSo, in the code, I'll insert the check right before the expPos calculation, then compute expPos correctly.\n\nLet me write the modified code.\n\nFirst, the check:\n\nif (str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e') || str.indexOf('E') != str.lastIndexOf('E')) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n\nThen, calculate expPos:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = eIndex + 1;\n} else if (EIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = EIndex + 1;\n}\n\nWait, but what if both 'e' and 'E' are present? The check we added earlier should have thrown an exception, so in the code after the check, only one of eIndex or EIndex can be valid.\n\nSo, this should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should fix the issue where multiple 'e's or 'E's cause incorrect parsing.\n\nTesting this with the example \"1eE\" would trigger the check, as indexOf('e') is 1, lastIndexOf('e') is 1, but indexOf('E') is 2, lastIndexOf('E') is 2. So, the condition is (1 !=1) || (2 !=2) \u2192 false || false \u2192 false. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, in the string \"1eE\", indexOf('e') is 1, lastIndexOf('e') is 1. So, the first part is false. For 'E's, indexOf('E') is 2, lastIndexOf('E') is 2. So, the condition is false || false \u2192 false. So, the check doesn't throw an exception, but the string is invalid because it has both 'e' and 'E'.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, the initial fix doesn't handle the case where both 'e' and 'E' are present, which is also invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition should be adjusted to check if the total number of 'e's (case-insensitive) is more than one.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nint eCount = 0;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nwhile (eIndex != -1) {\n    eCount++;\n    eIndex = str.indexOf('e', eIndex + 1);\n}\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nwhile (EIndex != -1) {\n    eCount++;\n    EIndex = str.indexOf('E', EIndex + 1);\n}\nif (eCount > 1) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n\nBut that's more code. Alternatively, using a regular expression to count the number of 'e's case-insensitively.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to check if the string contains both 'e' and 'E'.\n\nSo, if (str.indexOf('e') != -1 && str.indexOf('E') != -1), then throw.\n\nSo, adding that to the condition:\n\nif ((str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e')) || (str.indexOf('E') != str.lastIndexOf('E')) || (str.indexOf('e') != -1 && str.indexOf('E') != -1)) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n\nThis way, if the string has both 'e' and 'E', it will throw.\n\nSo, the condition now checks three cases:\n\n1. Multiple 'e's.\n\n2. Multiple 'E's.\n\n3. Both 'e' and 'E' present.\n\nThis should cover all cases where the exponent is specified more than once, regardless of case.\n\nSo, I'll update the condition to include the third case.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nif (str.indexOf('e') != str.lastIndexOf('e') || str.indexOf('E') != str.lastIndexOf('E') || (str.indexOf('e') != -1 && str.indexOf('E') != -1)) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\n\nThis should handle all invalid cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the fixed function would include this check before calculating expPos, and then correctly calculate expPos based on the presence of 'e' or 'E'.\n\nI think this should resolve the issue.\n</think>\n\n```java\npublic static Number createNumber(String str) throws NumberFormatException {\n    if (str == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    if (StringUtils.isBlank(str)) {\n        throw new NumberFormatException(\"A blank string is not a valid number\");\n    }  \n    if (str.startsWith(\"--\")) {\n        // this is protection for poorness in java.lang.BigDecimal.\n        // it accepts this as a legal value, but it does not appear \n        // to be in specification of class.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the createNumber function. The problem arises when the input string has multiple 'e's or 'E's, causing the code to incorrectly calculate the exponent position. This leads to a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nLooking at the original code, the issue is with how expPos is calculated. It uses str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1. If both 'e' and 'E' are present, this could result in an incorrect position. For example, if the string is \"1eE\", indexOf('e') is 1 and indexOf('E') is 2, so expPos becomes 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which is beyond the string length, causing an exception.\n\nThe suggested fix is to use a regular expression to parse the string more robustly. The regex pattern provided is \"([+-]?(?:\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d*)?|\\\\.\\\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?)\". This pattern should correctly capture the mantissa and exponent parts.\n\nSo, I'll replace the problematic lines with the regex-based approach. I'll create a Pattern and Matcher to check if the string matches the number format. If it doesn't match, throw a NumberFormatException. Then, extract the mantissa from the matcher group.\n\nI need to integrate this into the existing function without disrupting other parts. The original code handles various cases like hexadecimal, different number types (long, float, etc.), so I must ensure the new parsing doesn't interfere with those.\n\nI'll start by replacing the lines where decPos and expPos are calculated. Instead, I'll use the regex to get the mantissa. Then, I'll adjust the logic for extracting the decimal and exponent parts based on the regex result.\n\nWait, the original code also handles cases where the string ends with 'l', 'L', 'f', 'F', etc. So, I need to make sure that after extracting the numeric part, the suffix is correctly handled.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. After the initial checks (null, blank, starts with \"--\", hex), proceed to use the regex.\n2. Use the regex to match the string. If it doesn't match, throw an exception.\n3. Extract the mantissa (group 1) from the matcher.\n4. Then, check if the string has an exponent part by looking for 'e' or 'E' in the original string. But wait, the regex should have already captured that, so maybe I can extract the exponent from the mantissa string.\n\nWait, the regex captures the entire number, including exponent. So perhaps I can split the mantissa into the base and exponent parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should adjust the regex to separate the exponent. Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient because the regex ensures that the string is a valid number, and then the code can proceed to parse the mantissa and exponent correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's logic for handling the exponent and decimal parts can be simplified once we have a valid number from the regex. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to rely on the regex to extract the mantissa and exponent correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to first validate the string with the regex, then parse it accordingly.\n\nWait, the original code has a lot of logic after extracting mant, dec, and exp. So, perhaps after using the regex to get the mantissa, I can then process the string to find the exponent and decimal parts correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the regex can capture the exponent as a separate group. Let me think about modifying the regex to have groups for mantissa, exponent, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original approach of using the regex is sufficient to extract the entire number, and then the code can proceed to create the appropriate Number object without further parsing.\n\nWait, the original code is trying to determine whether the number is an integer, long, float, etc., based on the presence of a decimal point or exponent, and the suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps after validating the string with the regex, the code can proceed as before, but with a more reliable way of extracting the mantissa and exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps the main issue is the calculation of expPos. So, instead of calculating it as indexOf('e') + indexOf('E') +1, which is incorrect, I can find the position of the exponent correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to find the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E' and use that as the exponent position. So, perhaps:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nif (str.indexOf('e') != -1) {\n    expPos = str.indexOf('e');\n} else if (str.indexOf('E') != -1) {\n    expPos = str.indexOf('E');\n}\nif (expPos != -1) {\n    expPos++; // because the exponent starts after 'e' or 'E'\n}\n\nBut this approach would correctly find the first 'e' or 'E' and set expPos to the position after that character.\n\nWait, but in the original code, expPos is calculated as indexOf('e') + indexOf('E') +1, which is wrong because if both are present, it adds their positions. So, for \"1eE\", indexOf('e') is 1, indexOf('E') is 2, sum is 3, plus 1 is 4, which is beyond the string length (3), causing the exception when substring is called.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to find the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E' and set expPos to that index +1.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to correctly calculate expPos as the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E', then set expPos to that index +1.\n\nBut the user's suggestion is to use a regex, which is more robust. So, perhaps integrating the regex is better.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the regex approach.\n\nIn the fixed function, after the initial checks, I'll add:\n\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"([+-]?(?:\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d*)?|\\\\.\\\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?)\");\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(str);\nif (!matcher.matches()) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\nString numeric = matcher.group(1);\n\nWait, but the original code has logic to handle cases where the string ends with 'l', 'L', etc. So, perhaps the regex should not include those suffixes, and the code should handle them after extracting the numeric part.\n\nWait, the original code checks the last character to see if it's a letter, indicating a specific type (like 'L' for long). So, perhaps the regex should capture the numeric part without the suffix, and then the code can process the suffix as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the regex should capture the numeric part, and then the code can check the last character for the suffix.\n\nWait, but the original code's regex suggestion seems to capture the entire number, including the exponent. So, perhaps the code can be adjusted to extract the numeric part correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be modified to separate the mantissa and exponent.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, I can use the regex to validate the string and then proceed with the original parsing logic but with corrected expPos calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the root cause is the incorrect calculation of expPos, leading to substring calls with invalid indices. So, perhaps the fix is to correctly calculate expPos.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of using the regex, I can fix the way expPos is calculated.\n\nLet me think: the original code sets expPos as str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') +1. This is incorrect because if both 'e' and 'E' are present, their indices are added, leading to a value that's beyond the string length.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the first occurrence of either 'e' or 'E'. So, expPos should be the minimum of the two indices if both are present, or the index if only one is present.\n\nWait, no. Because 'e' and 'E' are in different positions. For example, in \"1e2E3\", the first exponent is at index 1, the second at index 3. So, the correct expPos should be the first occurrence.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should find the first 'e' or 'E' and set expPos to that index +1.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be modified as:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1 && EIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = Math.min(eIndex, EIndex) + 1;\n} else if (eIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = eIndex + 1;\n} else if (EIndex != -1) {\n    expPos = EIndex + 1;\n}\n\nBut this approach may not cover all cases correctly. For example, if 'e' is at position 2 and 'E' is at position 1, expPos should be 2 (since 'E' comes first). Wait, no, because 'E' is at 1, so the exponent starts at 1, so expPos should be 2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to loop through the string to find the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be adjusted to find the earliest 'e' or 'E' and set expPos accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the regex approach is more robust and handles all cases, including multiple exponents.\n\nSo, going back to the original suggestion, using the regex to extract the mantissa correctly.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, after the initial checks, I'll add the regex matching. If the string doesn't match, throw an exception. Then, extract the numeric part.\n\nWait, but the regex pattern is \"([+-]?(?:\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d*)?|\\\\.\\\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?)\", which captures the entire number, including the exponent. So, perhaps the code can then proceed to parse this numeric string into mantissa and exponent.\n\nWait, but the original code also handles cases where the string ends with a suffix like 'L' or 'F'. So, perhaps the regex should not include those suffixes, and the code should handle them separately.\n\nHmm, perhaps the regex should capture the numeric part without the suffix, and then the code can process the suffix as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture the numeric part, and then the code can check the last character for the suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can first extract the numeric part using the regex, then process the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's logic is as follows:\n\n- It checks if the last character is a digit or '.', otherwise, it checks for a suffix (like 'l', 'L', etc.) and processes accordingly.\n\nSo, perhaps integrating the regex into this flow would require:\n\n1. Use the regex to extract the numeric part (without the suffix).\n2. Then, check the last character of the original string to determine the suffix.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to adjust the regex to capture the entire number, including any exponent, and then process the suffix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be used to validate the string, and then the code can proceed with the original logic but with corrected expPos calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the main issue is the incorrect calculation of expPos, leading to substring exceptions. So, perhaps the fix is to correctly calculate expPos.\n\nSo, perhaps I can replace the line:\n\nint expPos = str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1;\n\nwith a correct way to find the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E' and set expPos to that index +1.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nIn Java, to find the first occurrence of either 'e' or 'E', I can do the following:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1 || EIndex != -1) {\n    if (eIndex == -1) {\n        expPos = EIndex + 1;\n    } else if (EIndex == -1) {\n        expPos = eIndex + 1;\n    } else {\n        expPos = Math.min(eIndex, EIndex) + 1;\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, expPos is set to the position after the first 'e' or 'E' in the string.\n\nThis should prevent the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException because expPos will correctly point to the start of the exponent part, and if there are multiple 'e's or 'E's, it will take the first one.\n\nSo, perhaps this is a simpler fix than using the regex, and it maintains the original code's structure.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has logic to handle the case where the exponent comes before the decimal point, which is invalid. So, after finding expPos, it checks if expPos < decPos and throws an exception.\n\nSo, with the corrected expPos, this logic should work correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to correctly calculate expPos by finding the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E' and setting expPos to that index +1.\n\nSo, in the code, I'll replace the line:\n\nint expPos = str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1;\n\nwith the logic above.\n\nLet me write that code:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1 || EIndex != -1) {\n    if (eIndex == -1) {\n        expPos = EIndex + 1;\n    } else if (EIndex == -1) {\n        expPos = eIndex + 1;\n    } else {\n        expPos = Math.min(eIndex, EIndex) + 1;\n    }\n}\n\nThis should correctly set expPos to the position after the first 'e' or 'E'.\n\nTesting this with the example \"1eE\":\n\n- eIndex is 1, EIndex is 2.\n- expPos is min(1,2) +1 = 2.\n\nSo, when the code does str.substring(0, expPos), it will take from 0 to 2, which is \"1e\", which is correct.\n\nThen, the exponent part is from expPos to the end, which is \"E\", but that's invalid because it's just 'E' without digits. So, the code should throw an exception, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after extracting mant and dec, it checks if the last character is not a digit or '.', and then processes the exponent.\n\nBut perhaps with the corrected expPos, the code will correctly handle the case where multiple 'e's or 'E's are present.\n\nSo, perhaps this fix is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, using the regex approach would make the parsing more robust, but it's a more significant change.\n\nGiven the instructions, the user provided a suggestion to use a regex, so perhaps I should follow that.\n\nSo, integrating the regex into the code.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. After the initial checks (null, blank, starts with \"--\", hex), proceed.\n2. Use the regex to match the string. If it doesn't match, throw an exception.\n3. Extract the mantissa from the matcher group.\n4. Then, process the string to find the exponent and decimal parts correctly.\n\nWait, but the regex captures the entire numeric part, including the exponent. So, perhaps the code can then proceed to create the appropriate Number object without further parsing.\n\nBut the original code has logic to handle different cases based on the presence of decimal points and exponents, and the suffix.\n\nHmm, perhaps the regex approach would simplify the parsing, but I need to ensure that all the original functionality is preserved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the regex can be used to extract the mantissa and exponent, and then the code can proceed as before.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to proceed with the regex approach as suggested.\n\nSo, in the code, after the initial checks, I'll add:\n\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"([+-]?(?:\\\\d+(?:\\\\.\\\\d*)?|\\\\.\\\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\\\d+)?)\");\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(str);\nif (!matcher.matches()) {\n    throw new NumberFormatException(str + \" is not a valid number.\");\n}\nString numeric = matcher.group(1);\n\nThen, the code can proceed to process 'numeric' as the main part, and check the last character for the suffix.\n\nWait, but the original code uses 'str' to find the last character. So, perhaps after extracting 'numeric', the code can process the suffix from the original string.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's logic is:\n\n- If the last character is a letter (like 'l', 'L', etc.), then it's a specific type.\n- Otherwise, it's a general number.\n\nSo, perhaps after extracting 'numeric' using the regex, the code can check the last character of the original string to determine the suffix.\n\nBut wait, the regex may have already consumed the exponent part, so the original string's last character may not be part of the numeric value.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to adjust the expPos calculation as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal fix is to correctly calculate expPos by finding the first occurrence of 'e' or 'E' and setting expPos to that index +1.\n\nThis would prevent the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException and handle cases with multiple 'e's or 'E's correctly.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, in the code, replace the line:\n\nint expPos = str.indexOf('e') + str.indexOf('E') + 1;\n\nwith the logic to find the first 'e' or 'E' and set expPos accordingly.\n\nLet me write that code:\n\nint expPos = -1;\nint eIndex = str.indexOf('e');\nint EIndex = str.indexOf('E');\nif (eIndex != -1 || EIndex != -1) {\n    if (eIndex == -1) {\n        expPos = EIndex + 1;\n    } else if (EIndex == -1) {\n        expPos = eIndex + 1;\n    } else {\n        expPos = Math.min(eIndex, EIndex) + 1;\n    }\n}\n\nThis should correctly set expPos.\n\nTesting this with \"1eE\":\n\n- eIndex is 1, EIndex is 2.\n- expPos is 1 +1 = 2.\n\nThen, when extracting mant = str.substring(0, expPos), it's \"1e\".\n\nThen, the code proceeds to check if decPos > -1, etc.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is \"1eE\", which is not a valid number because after 'e', there's another 'E' without digits. So, the code should throw an exception, which it does because when processing the exponent part, it finds that the exponent is not a valid number.\n\nSo, this fix should handle the case correctly.\n\nAnother test case: \"123e45E67\" would have expPos set to 3 (assuming 'e' is at 3), so mant is \"123e\", and the exponent is \"45E67\", which is invalid, so the code should throw an exception.\n\nThus, this fix should resolve the issue without introducing the regex, maintaining the original code's structure.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with this fix.\n</think>\n\n```java\npublic static Number createNumber(String str) throws NumberFormatException {\n    if (str == null) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    if (StringUtils.isBlank(str)) {\n        throw new NumberFormatException(\"A blank string is not a valid number\");\n    }  \n    if (str.startsWith(\"--\")) {\n        // this is protection for poorness in java.lang.BigDecimal.\n        // it accepts this as a legal value, but it does not appear \n        // to be in specification of class.
