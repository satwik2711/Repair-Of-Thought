      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the close() method of the CpioArchiveOutputStream class is not properly closing the underlying output stream, leading to an EOFException when trying to read the next entry from the CPIO archive input stream. This is because the close() method only calls the superclass's close() method, but does not properly close the underlying output stream.\nSuggestion: Close the Underlying Output Stream\nWe can modify the close() method to also close the underlying output stream. This can be done by calling the close() method on the underlying output stream after calling the superclass's close() method. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        super.close();\n        this.out.close();\n        this.closed = true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the underlying output stream is properly closed, preventing the EOFException.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        super.close();\n        this.closed = true;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the close() method only calls the superclass's close() method, but does not properly close the underlying output stream.\nSuggestion: Use a Try-with-Resources Statement\nWe can use a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the underlying output stream is properly closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This can be done by wrapping the code that uses the output stream in a try-with-resources statement. Here is an example:\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        try (OutputStream out = this.out) {\n            super.close();\n            this.closed = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the underlying output stream is properly closed, even if an exception is thrown.\n// Buggy Function\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        super.close();\n        this.closed = true;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
