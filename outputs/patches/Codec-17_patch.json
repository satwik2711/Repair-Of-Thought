      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `newStringIso8859_1` is not checking for null input before attempting to create a new string. The function is directly passing the input byte array to the `String` constructor, which throws a NullPointerException when the input is null.\nSuggestion: Check for Null Input Before Creating String\nCheck if the input byte array is null before attempting to create a new string. If the input is null, return null immediately. This is the most straightforward and efficient solution, as it aligns with the function's documentation and does not introduce any additional complexity.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static String newStringIso8859_1(final byte[] bytes) {\n    return new String(bytes, Charsets.ISO_8859_1);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function is directly passing the input byte array to the `String` constructor, which throws a NullPointerException when the input is null.\nSuggestion: Use Optional Class to Handle Null Input\nUse the Optional class to handle the null input. If the input is null, return an empty Optional. Otherwise, create a new string and return it wrapped in an Optional. This solution provides a more robust way of handling null inputs, but it may introduce additional complexity and may not be suitable for all use cases.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static String newStringIso8859_1(final byte[] bytes) {\n    return new String(bytes, Charsets.ISO_8859_1);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The function is directly passing the input byte array to the `String` constructor, which throws a NullPointerException when the input is null.\nSuggestion: Use Null-Object Pattern to Handle Null Input\nCreate a null-object that represents an empty string. If the input is null, return the null-object instead of throwing a NullPointerException. This solution provides a way to handle null inputs without introducing additional complexity, but it may not be suitable for all use cases, as it requires the creation of a null-object.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static String newStringIso8859_1(final byte[] bytes) {\n    return new String(bytes, Charsets.ISO_8859_1);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
