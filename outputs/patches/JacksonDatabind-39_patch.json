      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `deserialize` function is not properly handling unknown properties in the JSON string. The current implementation simply skips all children of the current JSON node, which means it's not able to deserialize the JSON string correctly. The `UnrecognizedPropertyException` is thrown because the deserializer is not able to recognize the field 'location' in the JSON string.\nSuggestion: Ignore Unknown Properties\nOne possible fix is to ignore unknown properties in the JSON string. We can do this by using the `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` feature and setting it to false. This will allow the deserializer to ignore unknown properties and continue deserializing the JSON string. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic Object deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\n    ctxt.getConfig().disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES);\n    // rest of the code\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException\n{\n    // 29-Jan-2016, tatu: Simple skipping for all other tokens, but FIELD_NAME bit\n    //    special unfortunately\n        p.skipChildren();\n    return null;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The `UnrecognizedPropertyException` is thrown because the deserializer is not able to recognize the field 'location' in the JSON string.\nSuggestion: Use a Custom Deserializer\nAnother possible fix is to use a custom deserializer that can handle unknown properties. We can create a custom deserializer that extends the `StdDeserializer` class and overrides the `handleUnknownProperty` method. In this method, we can ignore unknown properties or handle them in a custom way. Here is an example of how we can implement this:\n```java\npublic class CustomDeserializer extends StdDeserializer<Object> {\n    @Override\n    public Object deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\n        // handle unknown properties\n        return super.deserialize(p, ctxt);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected Object handleUnknownProperty(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt, Object beanOrClass, String propertyName) throws IOException {\n        // ignore unknown properties\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException\n{\n    // 29-Jan-2016, tatu: Simple skipping for all other tokens, but FIELD_NAME bit\n    //    special unfortunately\n        p.skipChildren();\n    return null;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This will allow the deserializer to ignore unknown properties and continue deserializing the JSON string.
