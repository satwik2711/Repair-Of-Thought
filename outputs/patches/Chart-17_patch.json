      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the getItemCount() method is returning 0 when the time series is empty, causing the end index to be -1. This is because the getItemCount() method is not checking if the time series is empty before returning the count. As a result, the createCopy method is being called with invalid indices, resulting in the IllegalArgumentException.\nSuggestion: Check for Empty Time Series\nCheck if the time series is empty before calling the createCopy method. If the time series is empty, return an empty clone. This approach ensures that the createCopy method is not called with invalid indices, preventing the IllegalArgumentException.\n\n```java\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    if (getItemCount() == 0) {\n        return new TimeSeries(\"Series\");\n    }\n    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);\n    return clone;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This is because the getItemCount() method is not checking if the time series is empty before returning the count.

This will ensure that the end index is not -1 when the time series is empty, preventing the IllegalArgumentException.\n\n```java\npublic int getItemCount() {\n    if (items.isEmpty()) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return items.size();\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);\n    return clone;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This approach avoids the issue of invalid indices altogether.\n\n```java\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    TimeSeries clone = new TimeSeries(\"Series\");\n    for (int i = 0; i < getItemCount(); i++) {\n        clone.add(getItem(i));\n    }\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);\n    return clone;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
