      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the copy constructor `XmlSerializerProvider(XmlSerializerProvider src)` is copying the `_rootNameLookup` field from the source instance `src` without considering the configuration of the new instance. This field is used to determine the root name of the XML output, and in this case, it is causing the output to contain the name 'AnnotatedName' instead of 'Pojo282'.\nSuggestion: Do Not Copy _rootNameLookup Field\nOne possible fix is to not copy the `_rootNameLookup` field from the source instance `src`. This can be done by removing the line `_rootNameLookup = src._rootNameLookup;` from the copy constructor. This will ensure that the new instance uses its own configuration to determine the root name of the XML output.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected XmlSerializerProvider(XmlSerializerProvider src) {\n    super(src);\n    // 21-May-2018, tatu: As per [dataformat-xml#282], should NOT really copy\n    //    root name lookup as that may link back to diff version, configuration\n    _rootNameLookup = src._rootNameLookup;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This field is used to determine the root name of the XML output, and in this case, it is causing the output to contain the name 'AnnotatedName' instead of 'Pojo282'.\nSuggestion: Use New Instance's Configuration\nAnother possible fix is to use the new instance's configuration to determine the root name of the XML output. This can be done by adding a line to the copy constructor to set the `_rootNameLookup` field based on the new instance's configuration. For example, `_rootNameLookup = new RootNameLookup(getConfig());`.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected XmlSerializerProvider(XmlSerializerProvider src) {\n    super(src);\n    // 21-May-2018, tatu: As per [dataformat-xml#282], should NOT really copy\n    //    root name lookup as that may link back to diff version, configuration\n    _rootNameLookup = src._rootNameLookup;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
