      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the ValueMarker constructor is calling the superclass constructor with the wrong parameters. Specifically, the constructor is passing the paint and stroke parameters twice, instead of passing the outline paint and outline stroke parameters. This is causing the outline paint color to be set to the same value as the paint color, instead of the expected blue color.\nSuggestion: Correct Constructor Call\nThe simplest fix for this bug is to correct the call to the superclass constructor in the ValueMarker constructor. Instead of passing the paint and stroke parameters twice, the constructor should pass the outline paint and outline stroke parameters. This can be done by changing the line `super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);` to `super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);`.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function",

Specifically, the constructor is passing the paint and stroke parameters twice, instead of passing the outline paint and outline stroke parameters. This is causing the outline paint color to be set to the same value as the paint color, instead of the expected blue color.\nSuggestion: Add Validation and Default Values\nAnother potential fix for this bug is to add validation to the ValueMarker constructor to ensure that the outline paint and outline stroke parameters are not null. If the outline paint or outline stroke parameters are null, the constructor can set a default value. This can be done by adding a simple null check at the beginning of the constructor and setting the outline paint and outline stroke parameters to default values if they are null.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This is causing the outline paint color to be set to the same value as the paint color, instead of the expected blue color.\nSuggestion: Use Constructor Overloading\nA third potential fix for this bug is to use constructor overloading to provide a default value for the outline paint and outline stroke parameters. This can be done by adding a new constructor that takes only the paint, stroke, and alpha parameters, and sets the outline paint and outline stroke parameters to default values. The existing constructor can then be modified to call the new constructor with the default values.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function"
