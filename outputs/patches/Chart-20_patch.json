      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue arises from the constructor of the ValueMarker class. In the call to the superclass constructor (super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha)), it mistakenly passes the paint and stroke again instead of the outlinePaint and outlineStroke. This results in the outlinePaint being set to the same value as the paint, which is Color.red in this case, instead of the intended Color.blue.\nSuggestion: Correct Parameter Passing\nThe constructor should pass the correct parameters to the superclass constructor. The corrected line should look like this: super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function",
