      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the constructor of the ValueMarker class is incorrectly setting the outline paint color. Specifically, the constructor is calling the superclass constructor with the wrong parameters, resulting in the outline paint color being set to the same value as the paint color.\nSuggestion: Correct Constructor Call\nThe constructor of the ValueMarker class should call the superclass constructor with the correct parameters. Specifically, the constructor should pass the outline paint and outline stroke as separate parameters, rather than passing the paint and stroke twice. This can be achieved by modifying the constructor call to super(outlinePaint, outlineStroke, paint, stroke, alpha).\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

Specifically, the constructor is calling the superclass constructor with the wrong parameters, resulting in the outline paint color being set to the same value as the paint color.\nSuggestion: Add Additional Validation\nAnother potential fix is to add additional validation in the constructor to ensure that the outline paint and outline stroke are not null. This can be achieved by adding null checks for these parameters and throwing an exception if they are null. However, this solution does not directly address the issue of the incorrect outline paint color being set.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Specifically, the constructor is calling the superclass constructor with the wrong parameters, resulting in the outline paint color being set to the same value as the paint color.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Constructor\nA third potential fix is to use a different constructor for the ValueMarker class. Specifically, the class could have a constructor that takes in separate parameters for the paint, stroke, outline paint, and outline stroke. This would allow the class to correctly set the outline paint color without relying on the superclass constructor. However, this solution would require significant changes to the class and may not be the most efficient solution.\n// Buggy Function\npublic ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, \n                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {\n    super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha);\n    this.value = value;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
