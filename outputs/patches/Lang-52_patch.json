      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `escapeJavaStyleString` is not correctly handling the forward slash character ('/') when escaping JavaScript strings. Specifically, the function is not writing the escaped forward slash character ('\\\\\\\\/') to the `Writer` object.\nSuggestion: Add Special Handling for Forward Slash\nWe can add a special case to handle the forward slash character ('/') in the `escapeJavaStyleString` function. We can add a new `case` statement to the `switch` block to handle this character. Here's the modified code:\n```java\n// ... (rest of the function remains the same)\nelse if (ch == '/') {\n    out.write('\\\\');\n    out.write('/');\n}\n// ...

We can use a regular expression to match all special characters and replace them with their escaped equivalents. However, this approach is not feasible in this case as we are not allowed to modify the class or add new functions. Instead, we can manually add the escape sequence for the forward slash character ('/') in the existing `switch` block. Here's the modified code:\n```java\n// ...
