      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the `multiplyFast` function is not handling large numbers correctly. When the input is a large number like 10000, the `multiplyFast` function is returning `NaN` instead of the correct result. This could be due to an overflow or underflow error in the `multiplyFast` function.\nSuggestion: Handling Large Numbers\nOne possible fix is to add a check for large numbers in the `multiply` function and handle them separately. For example, we could use a different algorithm or data structure to handle large numbers. This would require modifying the `multiply` function to check for large numbers and call a different function or use a different algorithm to handle them.\n\n```java\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n    // Check if the input is a large number\n    if (Math.abs(x) > 1000) {\n        // Use a custom multiplication algorithm to handle large numbers\n        return multiplyLargeNumbers(x);\n    } else {\n        // Use the original multiplication algorithm for small numbers\n        return multiplyFast(x);\n    }\n}\n\n// Custom multiplication algorithm for large numbers\nprivate Dfp multiplyLargeNumbers(final int x) {\n    // Implement a custom multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers accurately\n    // For example, use a divide-and-conquer approach or a recursive approach\n    // ...\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n        return multiplyFast(x);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

When the input is a large number like 10000, the `multiplyFast` function is returning `NaN` instead of the correct result. This could be due to an overflow or underflow error in the `multiplyFast` function.\nSuggestion: Using a Different Data Structure\nAnother possible fix is to use a different data structure to represent the `Dfp` object. For example, we could use a `BigInteger` or `BigDecimal` to represent the `Dfp` object, which would allow us to handle large numbers more accurately. This would require modifying the `Dfp` class to use a different data structure and updating the `multiply` function to work with the new data structure.\n\n```java\npublic class Dfp {\n    private BigInteger value;\n\n    public Dfp(BigInteger value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n\n    public Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n        return new Dfp(value.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(x)));\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n        return multiplyFast(x);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This could be due to an overflow or underflow error in the `multiplyFast` function.\nSuggestion: Implementing a Custom Multiplication Algorithm\nA third possible fix is to implement a custom multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers accurately. This would require modifying the `multiply` function to use a custom algorithm that can handle large numbers. For example, we could use a divide-and-conquer approach or a recursive approach to multiply the numbers.\n\n```java\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n    // Implement a custom multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers accurately\n    // For example, use a divide-and-conquer approach or a recursive approach\n    // ...\n    return new Dfp(value.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(x)));\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n        return multiplyFast(x);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
