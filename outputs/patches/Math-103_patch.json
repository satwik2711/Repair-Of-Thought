      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `Erf.erf` function is not able to converge for extreme values of `x`. This is because the `Erf.erf` function uses a series expansion to approximate the error function, and this expansion is not accurate for large values of `x`. When `x` is more than 20 standard deviations from the mean, the algorithm fails to converge, causing the `MaxIterationsExceededException` to be thrown.\nSuggestion: Use a More Accurate Approximation\nThe `Erf.erfc` function is more accurate for large values of `x` than the `Erf.erf` function. We can modify the `cumulativeProbability` function to use `Erf.erfc` instead of `Erf.erf` for extreme values of `x`. This will improve the accuracy of the cumulative probability calculation and prevent the `MaxIterationsExceededException` from being thrown.\n\n```java\npublic double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {\n    if (Math.abs(x - mean) > 20 * standardDeviation) {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erfc((x - mean) / (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n    } else {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((x - mean) / (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((x - mean) /\n                (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When `x` is more than 20 standard deviations from the mean, the algorithm fails to converge, causing the `MaxIterationsExceededException` to be thrown.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Algorithm\nThe `NormalDistributionImpl` class's `cumulativeProbability` method uses a different approximation of the error function that is more accurate for large values of `x`. We can modify the `cumulativeProbability` function to use this alternative algorithm for extreme values of `x`. This will improve the accuracy of the cumulative probability calculation and prevent the `MaxIterationsExceededException` from being thrown.\n\n```java\npublic double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {\n    if (Math.abs(x - mean) > 20 * standardDeviation) {\n        return NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability(x, mean, standardDeviation);\n    } else {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((x - mean) / (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((x - mean) /\n                (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When `x` is more than 20 standard deviations from the mean, the algorithm fails to converge, causing the `MaxIterationsExceededException` to be thrown.\nSuggestion: Handle Extreme Values Separately\nWe can handle extreme values of `x` separately by checking if `x` is more than 20 standard deviations from the mean, and if so, returning a special value (such as 0 or 1) instead of trying to calculate the cumulative probability. This will prevent the `MaxIterationsExceededException` from being thrown, but will also introduce a small error in the calculation of the cumulative probability.\n\n```java\npublic double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {\n    if (Math.abs(x - mean) > 20 * standardDeviation) {\n        if (x < mean) {\n            return 0.0;\n        } else {\n            return 1.0;\n        }\n    } else {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((x - mean) / (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n    }\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {\n        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((x - mean) /\n                (standardDeviation * Math.sqrt(2.0))));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
