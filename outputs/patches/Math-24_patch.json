Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the BrentOptimizer is not handling the step function correctly. The step function has a discontinuity at the point minSin + offset, which is causing the optimizer to converge to a wrong minimum. The optimizer is using a parabolic interpolation step, which is not suitable for functions with discontinuities.\nSuggestion: Use Golden Section Step\nOne possible fix is to use a golden section step instead of a parabolic interpolation step. This can be done by replacing the parabolic interpolation step with a golden section step in the BrentOptimizer. This will make the optimizer more robust to discontinuities in the function. The golden section step is a more conservative approach that is less likely to be affected by discontinuities.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected UnivariatePointValuePair doOptimize() {\n    final boolean isMinim = getGoalType() == GoalType.MINIMIZE;\n    final double lo = getMin();\n    final double mid = getStartValue();\n    final double hi = getMax();\n\n    // Optional additional convergence criteria.\n    final ConvergenceChecker<UnivariatePointValuePair> checker\n        = getConvergenceChecker();\n\n    double a;\n    double b;\n    if (lo < hi) {\n        a = lo;\n        b = hi;\n    } else {\n        a = hi;\n        b = lo;\n    }\n\n    double x = mid;\n    double v = x;\n    double w = x;\n    double d = 0;\n    double e = 0;\n    double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n    if (!isMinim) {\n        fx = -fx;\n    }\n    double fv = fx;\n    double fw = fx;\n\n    UnivariatePointValuePair previous = null;\n    UnivariatePointValuePair current\n        = new UnivariatePointValuePair(x, isMinim ? fx : -fx);\n\n    int iter = 0;\n    while (true) {\n        final double m = 0.5 * (a + b);\n        final double tol1 = relativeThreshold * FastMath.abs(x) + absoluteThreshold;\n        final double tol2 = 2 * tol1;\n\n        // Default stopping criterion.\n        final boolean stop = FastMath.abs(x - m) <= tol2 - 0.5 * (b - a);\n        if (!stop) {\n            double p = 0;\n            double q = 0;\n            double r = 0;\n            double u = 0;\n\n            if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) { // Fit parabola.\n                r = (x - w) * (fx - fv);\n                q = (x - v) * (fx - fw);\n                p = (x - v) * q - (x - w) * r;\n                q = 2 * (q - r);\n\n                if (q > 0) {\n                    p = -p;\n                } else {\n                    q = -q;\n                }\n\n                r = e;\n                e = d;\n\n                if (p > q * (a - x) &&\n                    p < q * (b - x) &&\n                    FastMath.abs(p) < FastMath.abs(0.5 * q * r)) {\n                    // Parabolic interpolation step.\n                    d = p / q;\n                    u = x + d;\n\n                    // f must not be evaluated too close to a or b.\n                    if (u - a < tol2 || b - u < tol2) {\n                        if (x <= m) {\n                            d = tol1;\n                        } else {\n                            d = -tol1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // Golden section step.\n                    if (x < m) {\n                        e = b - x;\n                    } else {\n                        e = a - x;\n                    }\n                    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Golden section step.\n                if (x < m) {\n                    e = b - x;\n                } else {\n                    e = a - x;\n                }\n                d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n            }\n\n            // Update by at least \"tol1\".\n            if (FastMath.abs(d) < tol1) {\n                if (d >= 0) {\n                    u = x + tol1;\n                } else {\n                    u = x - tol1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                u = x + d;\n            }\n\n            double fu = computeObjectiveValue(u);\n            if (!isMinim) {\n                fu = -fu;\n            }\n\n            // User-defined convergence checker.\n            previous = current;\n            current = new UnivariatePointValuePair(u, isMinim ? fu : -fu);\n\n            if (checker != null) {\n                if (checker.converged(iter, previous, current)) {\n                    return current;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Update a, b, v, w and x.\n            if (fu <= fx) {\n                if (u < x) {\n                    b = x;\n                } else {\n                    a = x;\n                }\n                v = w;\n                fv = fw;\n                w = x;\n                fw = fx;\n                x = u;\n                fx = fu;\n            } else {\n                if (u < x) {\n                    a = u;\n                } else {\n                    b = u;\n                }\n                if (fu <= fw ||\n                    Precision.equals(w, x)) {\n                    v = w;\n                    fv = fw;\n                    w = u;\n                    fw = fu;\n                } else if (fu <= fv ||\n                           Precision.equals(v, x) ||\n                           Precision.equals(v, w)) {\n                    v = u;\n                    fv = fu;\n                }\n            }\n        } else { // Default termination (Brent's criterion).\n            return current;\n        }\n        ++iter;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The smaller tolerance will also reduce the likelihood of overshooting the minimum.\n// Buggy Function\nprotected UnivariatePointValuePair doOptimize() {\n    final boolean isMinim = getGoalType() == GoalType.MINIMIZE;\n    final double lo = getMin();\n    final double mid = getStartValue();\n    final double hi = getMax();\n\n    // Optional additional convergence criteria.\n    final ConvergenceChecker<UnivariatePointValuePair> checker\n        = getConvergenceChecker();\n\n    double a;\n    double b;\n    if (lo < hi) {\n        a = lo;\n        b = hi;\n    } else {\n        a = hi;\n        b = lo;\n    }\n\n    double x = mid;\n    double v = x;\n    double w = x;\n    double d = 0;\n    double e = 0;\n    double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n    if (!isMinim) {\n        fx = -fx;\n    }\n    double fv = fx;\n    double fw = fx;\n\n    UnivariatePointValuePair previous = null;\n    UnivariatePointValuePair current\n        = new UnivariatePointValuePair(x, isMinim ? fx : -fx);\n\n    int iter = 0;\n    while (true) {\n        final double m = 0.5 * (a + b);\n        final double tol1 = relativeThreshold * FastMath.abs(x) + absoluteThreshold;\n        final double tol2 = 2 * tol1;\n\n        // Default stopping criterion.\n        final boolean stop = FastMath.abs(x - m) <= tol2 - 0.5 * (b - a);\n        if (!stop) {\n            double p = 0;\n            double q = 0;\n            double r = 0;\n            double u = 0;\n\n            if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) { // Fit parabola.\n                r = (x - w) * (fx - fv);\n                q = (x - v) * (fx - fw);\n                p = (x - v) * q - (x - w) * r;\n                q = 2 * (q - r);\n\n                if (q > 0) {\n                    p = -p;\n                } else {\n                    q = -q;\n                }\n\n                r = e;\n                e = d;\n\n                if (p > q * (a - x) &&\n                    p < q * (b - x) &&\n                    FastMath.abs(p) < FastMath.abs(0.5 * q * r)) {\n                    // Parabolic interpolation step.\n                    d = p / q;\n                    u = x + d;\n\n                    // f must not be evaluated too close to a or b.\n                    if (u - a < tol2 || b - u < tol2) {\n                        if (x <= m) {\n                            d = tol1;\n                        } else {\n                            d = -tol1;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    // Golden section step.\n                    if (x < m) {\n                        e = b - x;\n                    } else {\n                        e = a - x;\n                    }\n                    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n                }\n            } else {\n                // Golden section step.\n                if (x < m) {\n                    e = b - x;\n                } else {\n                    e = a - x;\n                }\n                d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n            }\n\n            // Update by at least \"tol1\".\n            if (FastMath.abs(d) < tol1) {\n                if (d >= 0) {\n                    u = x + tol1;\n                } else {\n                    u = x - tol1;\n                }\n            } else {\n                u = x + d;\n            }\n\n            double fu = computeObjectiveValue(u);\n            if (!isMinim) {\n                fu = -fu;\n            }\n\n            // User-defined convergence checker.\n            previous = current;\n            current = new UnivariatePointValuePair(u, isMinim ? fu : -fu);\n\n            if (checker != null) {\n                if (checker.converged(iter, previous, current)) {\n                    return current;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Update a, b, v, w and x.\n            if (fu <= fx) {\n                if (u < x) {\n                    b = x;\n                } else {\n                    a = x;\n                }\n                v = w;\n                fv = fw;\n                w = x;\n                fw = fx;\n                x = u;\n                fx = fu;\n            } else {\n                if (u < x) {\n                    a = u;\n                } else {\n                    b = u;\n                }\n                if (fu <= fw ||\n                    Precision.equals(w, x)) {\n                    v = w;\n                    fv = fw;\n                    w = u;\n                    fw = fu;\n                } else if (fu <= fv ||\n                           Precision.equals(v, x) ||\n                           Precision.equals(v, w)) {\n                    v = u;\n                    fv = fu;\n                }\n            }\n        } else { // Default termination (Brent's criterion).\n            return current;\n        }\n        ++iter;\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the BrentOptimizer's doOptimize method. The root cause is that the optimizer isn't handling step functions correctly because it uses parabolic interpolation, which doesn't work well with discontinuities. The suggestion is to add a check for discontinuities and handle them separately.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the current code works. The method uses a combination of the golden section search and parabolic interpolation. When the function is smooth, parabolic interpolation helps converge faster, but with a discontinuity, it can cause issues.\n\nSo, the plan is to detect discontinuities and switch to the golden section step when one is found. How can I detect a discontinuity? Maybe by checking the difference in function values between consecutive points. If the difference is large, it indicates a discontinuity.\n\nI'll need to introduce a threshold to determine what's considered a significant jump. Let's call it 'discontinuityThreshold'. I'll compute the absolute difference between the current function value (fx) and the previous value (fv or fw). If this difference exceeds the threshold, a discontinuity is present.\n\nWhen a discontinuity is detected, the code should avoid using parabolic interpolation and instead use the golden section step. So, I'll add a boolean flag, maybe 'discontinuityDetected', which is set to true when the function values jump beyond the threshold.\n\nI'll modify the section where the parabolic interpolation is considered. Before fitting the parabola, I'll check if a discontinuity was detected. If yes, I'll skip the parabolic step and use the golden section instead.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Define a new threshold variable, 'discontinuityThreshold', perhaps set to 1e-6 or similar, depending on the context.\n2. After computing 'fu', check the absolute difference between 'fu' and 'fx'. If it's greater than the threshold, set 'discontinuityDetected' to true.\n3. In the next iteration, before attempting parabolic interpolation, check if 'discontinuityDetected' is true. If so, use the golden section step instead.\n4. Reset 'discontinuityDetected' after each check to avoid it affecting subsequent iterations unnecessarily.\n\nWait, but how do I track the previous function values? Maybe I should store the previous function value each time and compare it with the current. Alternatively, since 'fv' and 'fw' are previous values, I can compare 'fx' with 'fv' or 'fw' to detect a sudden change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after computing 'fu', I can check if the change from 'fx' to 'fu' is significant. If |fu - fx| > threshold, then it's a discontinuity.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing 'fu', I'll add:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold) {\n    discontinuityDetected = true;\n}\n\nThen, in the next loop iteration, when deciding whether to fit the parabola, I'll check if 'discontinuityDetected' is true. If so, skip the parabolic step.\n\nBut wait, the parabolic interpolation is done when |e| > tol1. So, I'll need to modify that condition. Maybe change it to:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1 && !discontinuityDetected) { ... }\n\nAlternatively, inside the if block where parabolic interpolation is attempted, first check for discontinuity.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute the difference between the current function value and the previous one, and if it's above the threshold, force the use of the golden section step.\n\nLet me think about the variables. After computing 'fu', I can check if the absolute difference between 'fu' and 'fx' is greater than the threshold. If yes, set a flag.\n\nThen, in the next iteration, when the code is considering whether to use parabolic interpolation, it will check this flag. If the flag is set, it will use the golden section instead.\n\nSo, I'll add a boolean variable 'discontinuityDetected' initialized to false. After computing 'fu', I'll check:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold) {\n    discontinuityDetected = true;\n}\n\nThen, in the loop where it decides to fit the parabola:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    if (discontinuityDetected) {\n        // Use golden section\n        ...\n    } else {\n        // Proceed with parabola\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the 'discontinuityDetected' flag should be reset after each check so that it doesn't affect future iterations. So, perhaps after each iteration, set it back to false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to check the difference between the current and previous function values each time before attempting parabolic interpolation.\n\nAnother approach is to modify the condition where the parabolic interpolation is attempted. So, the code currently does:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) { // Fit parabola.\n\nI can add an additional condition here to check if a discontinuity is present. So, perhaps:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1 && !discontinuityDetected) { ... }\n\nBut how do I compute 'discontinuityDetected' each time?\n\nAlternatively, compute the difference between the current function value and the previous one each time before attempting the parabolic step.\n\nWait, perhaps the function values at x and u are being compared. So, after computing 'fu', I can check if the change is significant.\n\nSo, in the code, after 'fu' is computed, I can set a flag:\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nThen, in the next iteration, when considering the parabolic step, I can check this flag.\n\nWait, but in the next iteration, 'fx' would have been updated to 'fu', so perhaps I need to store the previous function value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to check the difference between 'fu' and 'fx' right after computing 'fu', and if it's above the threshold, then in the current iteration, avoid using parabolic interpolation.\n\nWait, but the parabolic interpolation is based on previous points. So, perhaps the discontinuity is between x and u. So, in the current iteration, after computing 'fu', if the difference is too big, we should not trust the parabolic model and instead use the golden section.\n\nSo, perhaps in the same iteration, after computing 'fu', check if |fu - fx| > threshold. If yes, then instead of proceeding with the parabolic step, use the golden section.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nAfter computing 'fu', check:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold) {\n    // Discontinuity detected, use golden section\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n    discontinuityDetected = true; // Maybe track this for next iteration?\n} else {\n    // Proceed with parabolic or golden as before\n}\n\nWait, but this might complicate the flow. Alternatively, perhaps within the parabolic interpolation block, after computing p, q, r, etc., check if the function values have changed significantly, and if so, discard the parabolic step and use golden section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem arises because the parabolic step can take us across the discontinuity, leading to incorrect minima. So, when a large change in function value is detected, we should avoid the parabolic step.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, after computing 'fu', before deciding whether to update a, b, etc., we can check if the function value changed abruptly. If so, we force a golden section step in the next iteration.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to add a check after computing 'fu' to see if the change is significant. If it is, then in the next iteration, the code will avoid the parabolic step.\n\nSo, I'll add a boolean flag 'discontinuityDetected' initialized to false. Then, after computing 'fu', I check:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold) {\n    discontinuityDetected = true;\n}\n\nThen, in the next loop iteration, when considering whether to fit the parabola, I check if 'discontinuityDetected' is true. If it is, I use the golden section step instead.\n\nSo, in the code, the condition for fitting the parabola becomes:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1 && !discontinuityDetected) { ... }\n\nAnd then, after handling the parabolic or golden step, I reset 'discontinuityDetected' to false for the next iteration.\n\nWait, but the 'discontinuityDetected' flag should be reset each iteration, so perhaps after each iteration, set it to false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the difference each time before attempting the parabolic step.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should check for a discontinuity each time before attempting the parabolic interpolation. So, in each iteration, after computing 'fu', check if the change is significant, and if so, avoid the parabolic step.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nCompute 'fu' as usual.\n\nThen, check if |fu - fx| > discontinuityThreshold. If yes, set a flag.\n\nThen, when deciding whether to fit the parabola, also check this flag.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nAdd a variable:\n\ndouble discontinuityThreshold = 1e-6; // Or another suitable value.\n\nThen, after computing 'fu':\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nThen, in the condition for fitting the parabola:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1 && !discontinuityDetected) { ... }\n\nElse, proceed with golden section.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the parabolic step is inside the 'if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1)' block. So, perhaps I should modify that condition to also exclude cases where a discontinuity is detected.\n\nSo, the code would become:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1 && !discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Fit parabola\n} else {\n    // Use golden section\n}\n\nBut wait, in the current code, even if e is not > tol1, it uses the golden section. So, perhaps the condition should be:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    if (!discontinuityDetected) {\n        // Fit parabola\n    } else {\n        // Use golden section\n    }\n} else {\n    // Use golden section\n}\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to first check for discontinuity, and if detected, use golden section regardless of e.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nCompute 'fu' as before.\n\nCheck for discontinuity:\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nThen, when deciding the step:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Use golden section\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    // Fit parabola\n    ... existing code ...\n} else {\n    // Use golden section\n    ... existing code ...\n}\n\nWait, but this changes the logic. Previously, when e is small, it uses golden section. Now, if there's a discontinuity, it uses golden section regardless of e.\n\nI think this approach makes sense because when a discontinuity is detected, the parabolic model isn't reliable, so we switch to a more robust method.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter computing 'fu' and before deciding the step, check for discontinuity.\n\nThen, structure the code as:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Golden section step\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    // Parabolic step\n    ... existing code ...\n} else {\n    // Golden section step\n    ... existing code ...\n}\n\nThis way, whenever a discontinuity is detected, the parabolic step is skipped.\n\nI also need to define 'discontinuityThreshold'. Since the original code uses 'relativeThreshold' and 'absoluteThreshold', perhaps the discontinuity threshold can be based on those, or a fixed value. For now, I'll set it as a small value, say 1e-6.\n\nSo, adding:\n\nfinal double discontinuityThreshold = 1e-6;\n\nNow, putting all together, the code will:\n\n1. Compute 'fu' as usual.\n2. Check if |fu - fx| > discontinuityThreshold. If yes, set 'discontinuityDetected' to true.\n3. When choosing the step, if 'discontinuityDetected' is true, use golden section. Else, proceed as before.\n\nI'll also need to declare 'discontinuityDetected' before the loop.\n\nWait, but in each iteration, 'discontinuityDetected' should be reset. So, perhaps inside the loop, after computing 'fu', set 'discontinuityDetected' based on the current 'fu' and 'fx'.\n\nSo, the steps inside the loop are:\n\n- Compute 'u' and 'fu'.\n- Check if |fu - fx| > threshold. Set 'discontinuityDetected' accordingly.\n- Decide the next step based on 'discontinuityDetected' and other conditions.\n\nWait, no. Because 'fu' is the function value at 'u', which is the new point. So, the discontinuity is between 'x' and 'u'. Therefore, in the next iteration, when considering the step from 'u', we need to check if the previous step had a discontinuity.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should store the previous function value and compare it with the current.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'discontinuityDetected' should be checked each time before attempting the parabolic step.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter computing 'fu', check if the change from 'fx' is significant. If yes, then in the next iteration, we avoid the parabolic step.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter computing 'fu':\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nThen, in the next iteration, when considering the step, if 'discontinuityDetected' is true, use golden section.\n\nBut since this is within the same iteration, perhaps I can adjust the step immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps within the same iteration, after computing 'fu', if the change is significant, then instead of proceeding with the parabolic step, switch to golden section.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nCompute 'fu' as before.\n\nCheck for discontinuity:\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nThen, in the same iteration, decide the step:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Use golden section\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    // Fit parabola\n    ... existing code ...\n} else {\n    // Use golden section\n    ... existing code ...\n}\n\nThis way, in the same iteration, if a discontinuity is detected, the step is adjusted.\n\nBut wait, in the current code, 'e' is computed before this. So, perhaps the 'e' needs to be recomputed if a discontinuity is detected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to first check for discontinuity, then decide the step.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n// After computing 'fu'\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Use golden section step\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else {\n    if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n        // Fit parabola\n        ... existing code ...\n    } else {\n        // Use golden section\n        ... existing code ...\n    }\n}\n\nThis would ensure that whenever a discontinuity is detected, the golden section is used, avoiding the parabolic step.\n\nI think this approach should handle the discontinuity correctly.\n\nNow, I'll implement these changes in the code.\n\nFirst, declare 'discontinuityThreshold' at the beginning:\n\nfinal double discontinuityThreshold = 1e-6;\n\nThen, after computing 'fu', add:\n\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nThen, modify the step selection logic:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    // Fit parabola\n    ... existing code ...\n} else {\n    // Use golden section\n    ... existing code ...\n}\n\nWait, but in the existing code, 'e' is computed before this. So, perhaps moving the 'e' computation inside the else block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should compute 'e' only when needed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code can be restructured as follows:\n\nRemove the initial 'e' computation, and compute 'e' inside each case.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, compute 'e' as before, but when discontinuity is detected, recompute 'e' based on the golden section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 'e' inside each conditional block.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 'e' is not needed anymore. Let me think.\n\nIn the original code, 'e' is computed as the distance from 'x' to 'a' or 'b' based on whether 'x' is less than 'm' or not. Then, 'd' is set to GOLDEN_SECTION * e.\n\nSo, perhaps in the discontinuity case, 'e' is recomputed in the same way.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else {\n    // Existing logic\n    if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) { ... } else { ... }\n}\n\nBut wait, in the existing code, 'e' is computed before the if-else. So, perhaps moving that computation inside the else block.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 'e' each time it's needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be restructured as:\n\n// Remove the initial 'e' computation.\n\nThen, in the step selection:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) { ... } else { ... }\n\nWait, but 'e' is not computed in this case. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 'e' can be kept, but when discontinuity is detected, 'e' is recomputed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 'e' each time inside the respective blocks.\n\nI think the key point is that when a discontinuity is detected, the code should use the golden section step, ignoring the parabolic interpolation.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter computing 'fu', check for discontinuity.\n\nIf discontinuity is detected:\n\n- Compute 'e' as (b - x) if x < m, else (a - x)\n- Set d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e\n\nElse:\n\n- Proceed with the existing logic, which uses parabolic if e > tol1, else golden.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else {\n    if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n        // Fit parabola\n        ... existing code ...\n    } else {\n        // Golden section step\n        if (x < m) {\n            e = b - x;\n        } else {\n            e = a - x;\n        }\n        d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the else block, the code is the same as the initial 'e' computation. So, perhaps the initial 'e' can be removed, and 'e' is computed inside each conditional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 'e' once before the conditionals, but then in the discontinuity case, recompute it.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to compute 'e' only when needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial 'e' computation can be removed, and 'e' is computed inside each case.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\n// Remove initial e computation.\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n    // Fit parabola\n    ... existing code ...\n} else {\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n}\n\nWait, but in the else if condition, 'e' is used, which hasn't been computed yet. So, perhaps the initial 'e' is still needed.\n\nThis is getting a bit messy. Maybe the initial 'e' should be kept, but when discontinuity is detected, 'e' is recomputed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured as follows:\n\nCompute 'e' as before.\n\nThen, check for discontinuity:\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Recompute 'e' based on x and m\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else {\n    // Proceed with existing logic\n    if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n        ... parabolic ...\n    } else {\n        ... golden ...\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, when discontinuity is detected, 'e' is recomputed, overriding the initial value.\n\nI think this approach would work.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n// Initial e computation remains\ndouble e = 0;\nif (x < m) {\n    e = b - x;\n} else {\n    e = a - x;\n}\n\n// Then, after computing 'fu'\nboolean discontinuityDetected = FastMath.abs(fu - fx) > discontinuityThreshold;\n\nif (discontinuityDetected) {\n    // Recompute e based on x and m\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n} else {\n    if (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) {\n        // Fit parabola\n        ... existing code ...\n    } else {\n        // Golden section step\n        d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the else block, 'd' is set to GOLDEN_SECTION * e, which is the same as the initial 'e' computation. So, perhaps the initial 'e' can be used.",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the BrentOptimizer's doOptimize method. The root cause is that the parabolic interpolation step isn't handling the step function's discontinuity well. So, the optimizer converges to the wrong minimum. The suggestion is to replace the parabolic step with a cubic interpolation and reduce the tolerance.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the original code. The parabolic step is used when the absolute value of 'e' is greater than 'tol1'. So, I need to replace this part with a cubic interpolation.\n\nIn the original code, when the parabola fit is done, variables p, q, r are calculated. Then, it checks if the parabolic step is within the bounds and if it's better than the golden section. If so, it takes that step; else, it uses the golden section.\n\nTo switch to cubic interpolation, I'll need to compute more points. But wait, cubic interpolation requires more data points. The original code uses x, v, w, which are the current, previous, and before previous points. Maybe I can use these to fit a cubic polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Brent's method can be modified to use inverse quadratic interpolation, which is more robust. Or maybe switch to a secant method when the function isn't smooth.\n\nWait, another approach is to adjust the conditions under which the parabolic step is taken. Maybe when the function is not smooth, the parabolic step isn't reliable, so we should fall back to the golden section more often.\n\nBut according to the suggestion, using a cubic interpolation with a smaller tolerance might help. So, perhaps I can implement a cubic interpolation step in place of the parabolic one.\n\nLet me think about how cubic interpolation works. It uses three points to fit a cubic curve. So, I can use the points (v, fv), (w, fw), (x, fx) to compute the coefficients of the cubic. Then, find the minimum of this cubic within the interval [a, b].\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the variables are a bit confusing. Let me see: x is the current point, v is the previous, w is before that. So, I have three points: v, w, x. Or maybe it's x, v, w. I need to make sure I'm using the correct points for interpolation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look up the Brent's method algorithm to see how it's typically implemented. Brent's method usually combines the golden section search with inverse quadratic interpolation. Oh, right, inverse quadratic is a form of parabolic interpolation but using three points.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the current implementation's parabolic step isn't handling the discontinuity, so perhaps the tolerance needs to be adjusted, and the step size needs to be more controlled.\n\nThe suggestion also says to reduce the tolerance for the interpolation step. So, perhaps I should modify the 'tol1' and 'tol2' variables, making them smaller to prevent overshooting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the function has a discontinuity, the parabolic step tries to go beyond the discontinuity, leading to incorrect minima. So, in such cases, the optimizer should avoid taking large steps based on the parabolic model.\n\nSo, maybe the fix is to adjust the conditions under which the parabolic step is accepted. For example, if the computed step 'd' would take 'u' too close to 'a' or 'b', then instead of taking the parabolic step, we take a golden section step.\n\nLooking at the original code, after computing 'd', it checks if 'u' is too close to 'a' or 'b'. If so, it adjusts 'd' to 'tol1' or '-tol1'. But perhaps this adjustment isn't sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: after computing 'u' via parabolic interpolation, check if 'u' is within the interval [a, b]. If not, clamp it. Or, perhaps, if the step would take 'u' outside the interval, use the golden section instead.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the parabolic step is being used even when the function isn't unimodal or smooth, leading to incorrect steps. So, maybe the condition to accept the parabolic step should be stricter.\n\nIn the original code, the parabolic step is accepted if p is within q*(a -x) and q*(b -x), and |p| < 0.5 * |q*r|. Maybe these conditions aren't sufficient when the function has a discontinuity.\n\nSo, perhaps I should add an additional condition that the function value at 'u' is actually better than the current minimum. Or, after computing 'u', evaluate the function and see if it's an improvement. If not, discard the parabolic step and take a golden section step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the tolerance 'tol1' is too large, allowing 'u' to be too close to the discontinuity. So, reducing 'tol1' and 'tol2' might help.\n\nWait, the suggestion says to use a more robust interpolation step, like cubic, with a smaller tolerance. So, perhaps I should replace the parabolic step with a cubic one.\n\nBut implementing a cubic interpolation step would require more changes. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nIn cubic interpolation, given four points, we can fit a cubic spline. But in this case, we have three points: v, w, x. So, perhaps we can fit a cubic polynomial using these three points and find its minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of finite differences to compute the coefficients of the cubic.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can switch to using the golden section step more often when the function isn't smooth.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the parabolic step is causing the optimizer to jump over the discontinuity, leading to convergence on the wrong side. So, perhaps the solution is to detect when the function is not smooth and switch to a more reliable method.\n\nBut how can I detect that? Maybe by checking if the function value at 'u' is significantly different than expected based on the model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tolerance for accepting the parabolic step should be smaller when the function is near a discontinuity.\n\nHmm, perhaps the simplest approach is to reduce the tolerance 'tol1' and 'tol2' so that the optimizer takes smaller steps, making it less likely to overshoot the discontinuity.\n\nLooking at the original code, 'tol1' is computed as relativeThreshold * |x| + absoluteThreshold. Maybe I can reduce the relativeThreshold or the absoluteThreshold.\n\nBut wait, the suggestion says to use a smaller tolerance for the interpolation step. So, perhaps I can adjust 'tol1' and 'tol2' to be smaller values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can modify the condition where the parabolic step is accepted. For example, only accept it if the step size is smaller than a certain threshold relative to the current interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the function has a discontinuity, the parabolic model isn't a good fit, so the step suggested by the model is incorrect. So, in such cases, the optimizer should not trust the model and instead take a golden section step.\n\nSo, perhaps I can add a condition to only accept the parabolic step if the function is sufficiently smooth around the current point. But how to measure smoothness?\n\nAlternatively, after computing 'u' via the parabolic step, evaluate the function at 'u' and compare it to the expected value based on the model. If it's too different, discard the step and take a golden section step.\n\nBut that would require an extra function evaluation, which might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can modify the conditions under which the parabolic step is taken. For example, only take it if the function has been evaluated enough times and the model is a good fit.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest approach is to switch to using the golden section step more often when the function isn't behaving as expected.\n\nWait, looking at the original code, after computing 'd' via the parabolic step, it checks if 'u' is too close to 'a' or 'b'. If so, it adjusts 'd' to 'tol1' or '-tol1'. But perhaps this isn't sufficient.\n\nAnother idea: after computing 'u', check if it's within the interval [a, b]. If not, clamp it to the nearest boundary. But that might not solve the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the function has a discontinuity, the parabolic step causes 'u' to jump over it, leading to incorrect behavior. So, perhaps the solution is to limit the maximum step size when using the parabolic interpolation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can add a condition that the step size 'd' must be less than a certain fraction of the current interval length. For example, if 'd' is larger than, say, 0.5*(b - a), then take a golden section step instead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the parabolic step is causing the optimizer to get stuck near the discontinuity. So, perhaps reducing the influence of the parabolic step when the function isn't smooth.\n\nBut how to detect that? Maybe by checking the difference in function values between iterations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial step size is too large, causing the optimizer to miss the correct minimum. So, perhaps reducing the initial step size or adjusting how 'd' is computed.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to replace the parabolic step with a cubic interpolation step. Let me think about how to implement that.\n\nIn the cubic interpolation, given three points (v, fv), (w, fw), (x, fx), we can fit a cubic polynomial and find its minimum. Then, the next step 'u' is the minimum of this cubic within [a, b].\n\nBut fitting a cubic requires solving for the coefficients. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Using points (v, fv), (w, fw), (x, fx), and possibly another point, fit a cubic polynomial.\n\nWait, three points can fit a quadratic, but for a cubic, we need four points. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the methods.\n\nWait, Brent's method typically uses inverse quadratic interpolation, which uses three points to fit a quadratic model of the function's inverse. So, perhaps the current code is using that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is using a parabolic step, which is the same as inverse quadratic interpolation. So, perhaps the problem is that the inverse quadratic model isn't suitable for functions with discontinuities.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to switch to a different interpolation method when the function isn't smooth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code allows the parabolic step to take 'u' too close to the boundaries, causing it to step over the discontinuity. So, perhaps the tolerance checks need to be stricter.\n\nLooking at the code, after computing 'u' as x + d, it checks if u is within tol2 of a or b. If so, it adjusts 'd' to tol1 or -tol1. But perhaps this isn't enough.\n\nMaybe I should reduce the 'tol2' value so that 'u' is not allowed to get too close to the boundaries, thus avoiding the discontinuity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'tol1' and 'tol2' should be computed differently, perhaps scaled by a smaller factor.\n\nWait, the suggestion says to use a smaller tolerance. So, perhaps I can adjust the relativeThreshold and absoluteThreshold variables to smaller values. But in the code, these are passed as parameters, so perhaps I can't change them directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps within the method, after computing 'tol1' and 'tol2', I can scale them down by a factor when performing the interpolation step.\n\nBut that might complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code uses the same 'tol1' for both the stopping criterion and the step adjustment. Maybe I should use a smaller tolerance specifically for the interpolation steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can introduce a new variable, say 'interpolationTol', which is a fraction of 'tol1', and use that for the step checks.\n\nBut that would require more changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code doesn't handle the case where the function is not unimodal, which is a requirement for Brent's method. So, perhaps the function in question doesn't meet the unimodality condition, causing the optimizer to fail.\n\nBut the user's context mentions a step function, which has a discontinuity but is piecewise constant. So, perhaps the function isn't unimodal, but Brent's method expects it to be.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the optimizer isn't suitable for such functions, but the user still wants it to work. So, perhaps the solution is to make the optimizer more robust by using a different interpolation method.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the simplest fix is to replace the parabolic interpolation with a cubic one and adjust the tolerance.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find an example of Brent's method with cubic interpolation and adapt it here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can modify the code to use the golden section step more often when the parabolic step would take 'u' outside a certain safe range.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the parabolic step is causing 'u' to be on the wrong side of the discontinuity. So, perhaps after computing 'u', I should check if the function value at 'u' is consistent with the surrounding points. If not, discard 'u' and take a golden section step.\n\nBut that would require an extra function evaluation, which might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the next step as the minimum between the parabolic step and the golden section step, ensuring that 'u' doesn't jump too far.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to reduce the step size when the function is near a discontinuity. But how to detect that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code's condition for accepting the parabolic step is too lenient. So, perhaps I can make it stricter by adding more conditions.\n\nLooking at the code, the parabolic step is accepted if:\n\np > q*(a - x) && p < q*(b - x) && |p| < 0.5 * |q*r|\n\nPerhaps I can add another condition that the step 'd' is not too large compared to the current interval.\n\nFor example, |d| < 0.5*(b - a), ensuring that the step doesn't take us too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the maximum allowed step as a fraction of the interval and cap 'd' accordingly.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing 'd = p/q', I can check if 'd' is larger than a certain fraction of (b - a). If so, reduce it.\n\nBut I'm not sure what fraction to use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code allows 'u' to be too close to 'a' or 'b', which could be near the discontinuity. So, perhaps the 'tol2' should be smaller.\n\nIn the original code, 'tol2' is 2 * tol1. So, perhaps I can make 'tol2' smaller by adjusting 'tol1'.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to modify the 'tol1' and 'tol2' variables. Let me see:\n\nIn the original code:\n\nfinal double tol1 = relativeThreshold * FastMath.abs(x) + absoluteThreshold;\nfinal double tol2 = 2 * tol1;\n\nIf I reduce 'tol1' by a factor, say 0.5, then 'tol2' becomes 1 * relativeThreshold * |x| + absoluteThreshold.\n\nBut how can I adjust this without changing the method's parameters? Because relativeThreshold and absoluteThreshold are probably passed in from outside.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps within the method, after computing 'tol1', I can scale it down for the interpolation steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute a smaller tolerance specifically for the interpolation step.\n\nLet me think: perhaps create a new variable, say 'interpolationTol' which is 0.5 * tol1. Then, use this for the conditions related to the parabolic step.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code uses the same 'tol1' for both the stopping condition and the step adjustment. Maybe I should use a smaller tolerance for the step adjustment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to switch to using a golden section step whenever the function isn't smooth, which can be detected by the change in function values.\n\nBut without knowing the function's behavior, it's hard to detect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code doesn't handle the case where the function has a step discontinuity, so the parabolic model is not a good fit, leading to incorrect steps. So, perhaps the solution is to use a more robust step, like the golden section, more often.\n\nSo, perhaps I can modify the condition under which the parabolic step is taken. For example, only take the parabolic step if the function values are consistent with a smooth function.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compare the function value at 'u' with the expected value from the parabolic model. If the actual value is too different, discard the step.\n\nBut that would require evaluating the function at 'u' before deciding, which is what the code already does. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the code, after computing 'u', it evaluates 'fu' and then decides whether to accept 'u' as the new point. So, perhaps the issue is that even after taking a parabolic step, the function value isn't better, leading to incorrect convergence.\n\nBut in that case, the code should fall back to the golden section step in the next iteration.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the parabolic step is causing the optimizer to get stuck near the discontinuity, oscillating between points. So, perhaps the solution is to reduce the step size when the function isn't improving.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to use a smaller 'relativeThreshold' and 'absoluteThreshold' to make the optimizer take smaller steps, thus avoiding jumping over the discontinuity.\n\nBut since these thresholds are parameters, perhaps the method can't change them directly. So, perhaps within the method, after computing 'tol1' and 'tol2', I can scale them down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code's condition for accepting the parabolic step is incorrect. Let me look at the condition again:\n\nif (p > q * (a - x) && p < q * (b - x) && FastMath.abs(p) < FastMath.abs(0.5 * q * r))\n\nThis condition ensures that 'p' is within the interval [q(a -x), q(b -x)] and that the magnitude of 'p' is less than half the magnitude of 'q r'.\n\nBut perhaps this isn't sufficient to prevent steps that jump over discontinuities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can add another condition that the step 'd' must be less than a certain fraction of the current interval length.\n\nSo, after computing 'd = p/q', I can check if |d| > 0.5*(b - a). If so, then take a golden section step instead.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(d) > 0.5 * (b - a)) {\n    // take golden section step\n    if (x < m) {\n        e = b - x;\n    } else {\n        e = a - x;\n    }\n    d = GOLDEN_SECTION * e;\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure if 0.5 is the right fraction. Maybe 0.25 or another value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cap 'd' to be no more than the golden section step.\n\nWait, the golden section step is about 0.618 times the interval, but perhaps that's too large. So, perhaps capping 'd' to a smaller fraction.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to replace the parabolic step with a cubic interpolation step. Let me outline how that would work.\n\nCubic interpolation uses four points to fit a cubic curve, but in our case, we have three points: v, w, x. So, perhaps we can fit a cubic using these three points and their function values.\n\nWait, three points can fit a quadratic, but for a cubic, we need four points. So, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method of finite differences to compute higher-order terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the existing points to compute a cubic model.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can refer to a standard implementation of Brent's method with cubic interpolation.\n\nWait, Brent's method typically uses inverse quadratic interpolation, which is a form of parabolic interpolation. So, perhaps the issue is that the current implementation isn't correctly handling the step function, and the solution is to adjust the conditions under which the parabolic step is taken.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code allows the parabolic step to take 'u' beyond the point where the function changes, leading to incorrect behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to limit the step size when the function is near a discontinuity.\n\nBut without knowing where the discontinuity is, it's hard to detect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to use a smaller tolerance for the interpolation steps, making the optimizer take smaller steps and thus less likely to jump over the discontinuity.\n\nSo, perhaps I can adjust 'tol1' and 'tol2' to be smaller values.\n\nBut in the code, 'tol1' is computed as relativeThreshold * |x| + absoluteThreshold. So, perhaps I can scale down 'relativeThreshold' and 'absoluteThreshold' within the method.\n\nBut since these are final variables, perhaps I can't change them directly. Alternatively, I can compute a smaller 'tol1' for the interpolation steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute a new 'interpolationTol' as 0.5 * tol1, and use that in the conditions related to the parabolic step.\n\nSo, in the code, after computing 'tol1' and 'tol2', I can compute:\n\ndouble interpolationTol = 0.5 * tol1;\n\nThen, in the condition where the parabolic step is considered, replace 'tol1' with 'interpolationTol'.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code's 'relativeThreshold' is too large, causing 'tol1' to be too big, allowing 'u' to be too close to the discontinuity.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to reduce 'relativeThreshold' and 'absoluteThreshold' when computing 'tol1' and 'tol2'.\n\nBut since these are parameters passed into the method, perhaps the method can't change them. So, perhaps the solution is to adjust them within the method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to use a different approach, such as taking the golden section step whenever the parabolic step would take 'u' outside a certain range.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let me think differently.\n\nThe user's suggestion is to replace the parabolic interpolation with a cubic one and reduce the tolerance. So, perhaps I can implement a cubic interpolation step.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the code, when the parabolic step is considered, I can replace that part with a cubic interpolation.\n\nSo, in the code, the parabolic step is:\n\nif (FastMath.abs(e) > tol1) { // Fit parabola.\n    r = (x - w) * (fx - fv);\n    q = (x - v) * (fx - fw);\n    p = (x - v) * q - (x - w) * r;\n    q = 2 * (q - r);\n\n    if (q > 0) {\n        p = -p;\n    } else {\n        q = -q;\n    }\n\n    r = e;\n    e = d;\n\n    if (p > q * (a - x) &&\n        p < q * (b - x) &&\n        FastMath.abs(p) < FastMath.abs(0.5 * q * r)) {\n        // Parabolic interpolation step.\n        d = p / q;\n        u = x + d;\n\n        // f must not be evaluated too close to a or b.\n        if (u - a < tol2 || b - u < tol2)"
