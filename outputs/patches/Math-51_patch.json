      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the doSolve() function. The root cause is that the function doesn't handle cases where the initial interval [x0, x1] doesn't bracket the root, leading to an infinite loop. The suggestion is to update the interval bounds when the new approximation x is outside the interval.\n\nLet me look at the original code. The function starts by setting x0 and x1 as the initial bounds. It checks if f0 or f1 is zero and returns the corresponding x. Then it verifies the bracketing, which probably ensures that f0 and f1 have opposite signs.\n\nIn the loop, it calculates the next approximation x using the formula x = x1 - (f1*(x1 - x0))/(f1 - f0). Then it computes fx. If fx is zero, it returns x.\n\nThen, the code checks if f1 * fx < 0. If so, it updates x0, f0, and inverts the interval. Otherwise, it applies the method (ILLINOIS or PEGASUS) to update f0. Then it sets x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nWait, the problem arises when the new x is outside [x0, x1]. The current code doesn't handle that. So, after computing x, if x is less than x0 or greater than x1, the interval isn't updated correctly, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fix suggestion says to add code that updates the interval bounds when x is outside. So, after computing x and fx, before the existing logic, I should check if x is outside [x0, x1]. If x < x0, set x1 = x0, x0 = x, and update f0 and f1 accordingly. Similarly, if x > x1, set x0 = x1, x1 = x, and update f0 and f1.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after computing x, it's possible that x is outside the current interval. So, the new x might not lie between x0 and x1. The current code doesn't adjust the interval in that case, leading to incorrect bracketing.\n\nSo, I need to insert the suggested code right after computing x and fx. Let me see where to place it.\n\nIn the original code, after computing x and fx, the first check is if fx is zero. Then, it proceeds to update the interval. So, I should insert the new code after that.\n\nWait, no. The new code should come after computing x and fx, but before the existing logic that checks if f1 * fx < 0.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute x and fx.\n2. If fx is zero, return x.\n3. Check if x is outside [x0, x1]. If so, update the interval bounds and the function values.\n4. Then proceed with the existing logic.\n\nSo, in the code, after the line where fx is computed, I should add the suggested if-else block.\n\nLet me outline the changes:\n\nAfter:\nfinal double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n\nAdd:\nif (x < x0) {\n    x1 = x0;\n    x0 = x;\n    f1 = f0;\n    f0 = fx;\n} else if (x > x1) {\n    x0 = x1;\n    x1 = x;\n    f0 = f1;\n    f1 = fx;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after computing x, it's possible that x is outside the interval. So, this new code will adjust the interval correctly.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after computing x, the code checks if f1 * fx < 0. If so, it swaps x0 and x1, etc. But if x is outside, that might not handle it correctly.\n\nSo, adding the new code right after computing fx should handle the case where x is outside the interval.\n\nLet me think about the flow:\n\n- Compute x as the new approximation.\n- Compute fx.\n- If x is less than x0, then the new interval becomes [x, x0], and f0 becomes fx, f1 becomes the old f0.\n- Similarly, if x is greater than x1, the new interval is [x1, x], and f0 becomes old f1, f1 becomes fx.\n- Then, proceed to check if f1 * fx < 0, which would handle the bracketing.\n\nWait, but after adjusting the interval, the existing logic may not be necessary. Or perhaps it's better to handle it this way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the existing logic is trying to handle the case where the root is bracketed, but when x is outside, it's not handled, leading to the interval not being updated correctly.\n\nSo, adding the new code should ensure that the interval is always updated, whether x is inside or outside.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example.\n\nSuppose x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x is computed as 0.5. So x < x0. Then, x1 becomes 1, x0 becomes 0.5. f1 becomes f0 (which was computeObjectiveValue(1)), f0 becomes fx (computeObjectiveValue(0.5)).\n\nThen, the code proceeds. Now, the interval is [0.5, 1], which is correct.\n\nAnother example: x0=1, x1=2, x=3. Then x1 becomes 2, x0 becomes 3. Wait, no: in the else if, x > x1, so x0 = x1 (2), x1 = x (3). f0 becomes f1, f1 becomes fx.\n\nWait, but in this case, the interval becomes [2,3], which is correct.\n\nSo, adding this code should handle the cases where x is outside the initial interval.\n\nI think this will fix the issue where the interval isn't updated correctly, preventing the infinite loop.\n\nSo, in the code, I'll insert the suggested if-else block after computing fx.\n\nNow, let me look at the original code structure.\n\nAfter computing x and fx, the code checks if fx is zero and returns x. Then, it proceeds to update the bounds.\n\nI should insert the new code after the fx computation and after the fx == 0 check.\n\nWait, no. Because if x is outside, but fx is zero, we would have already returned x. So, the new code should be placed after the fx == 0 check.\n\nSo, the order is:\n\nCompute x and fx.\n\nIf fx is zero, return x.\n\nThen, check if x is outside the interval and update accordingly.\n\nThen, proceed with the existing logic.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfinal double x = ...;\nfinal double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n\nif (fx == 0.0) {\n    return x;\n}\n\n// Update interval bounds if x is outside [x0, x1]\nif (x < x0) {\n    x1 = x0;\n    x0 = x;\n    f1 = f0;\n    f0 = fx;\n} else if (x > x1) {\n    x0 = x1;\n    x1 = x;\n    f0 = f1;\n    f1 = fx;\n}\n\nThen, the rest of the code.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after computing x, the code does:\n\nif (f1 * fx < 0) {\n    // invert interval\n} else {\n    // apply method\n}\n\nSo, after adding the new code, perhaps the existing logic can handle the bracketing correctly.\n\nI think this should fix the issue.\n\nSo, the fixed function will include this new block after the fx computation and the fx == 0 check.\n\nI need to make sure that the code is inserted correctly without disrupting the rest of the logic.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after updating x0 and x1, the code proceeds to update x1 and f1 again. Wait, no, because in the new code, if x is outside, x0 and x1 are updated, and f0 and f1 are set accordingly. Then, the code proceeds to the existing logic.\n\nWait, in the original code, after the if-else, it sets x1 = x and f1 = fx. But in the new code, if x is outside, x1 and x0 are already updated, so setting x1 = x again would overwrite that. That's a problem.\n\nOh, right! So, in the original code, after the if-else block, it does:\n\nx1 = x;\nf1 = fx;\n\nWhich would undo the changes made by the new code if x is outside.\n\nSo, that's a problem. Because after adjusting x0 and x1 in the new code, the original code sets x1 = x again, which would put x back as x1, possibly outside the interval.\n\nSo, that's an issue. So, perhaps the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed or adjusted.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nIn the original code, after the if-else, it does:\n\nx1 = x;\nf1 = fx;\n\nWhich effectively sets the new x as x1, regardless of where it is. But if the new code has already adjusted x0 and x1, then this line would set x1 back to x, which might not be correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the x1 = x and f1 = fx lines should be removed, or only executed under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should replace that part.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because the original code's logic is that after the if-else, it sets x1 to x and f1 to fx. But if the new code has already updated x0 and x1, then this would overwrite x1.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to remove the x1 = x and f1 = fx lines, because the new code already handles updating x0, x1, f0, and f1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing logic, and the existing x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe original code's structure is:\n\nCompute x and fx.\n\nIf fx is zero, return.\n\nCheck if f1 * fx < 0: if so, swap x0 and x1, invert the interval.\n\nElse, apply the method to update f0.\n\nThen, set x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nSo, the problem is that when x is outside the interval, the existing code doesn't handle it, leading to incorrect interval updates.\n\nSo, the new code should handle the case where x is outside the interval before the existing logic.\n\nBut then, after handling that case, the existing code's x1 = x and f1 = fx would overwrite the changes made by the new code.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to adjust the code so that after the new code runs, the existing code doesn't set x1 = x and f1 = fx again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed after the existing if-else, but before setting x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nWait, no, because the new code needs to handle the case where x is outside the interval, which should be done before the existing logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed after the existing if-else, but before the x1 = x line.\n\nWait, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute x and fx.\n\n2. If fx is zero, return x.\n\n3. Check if x is outside [x0, x1]. If so, update x0, x1, f0, f1.\n\n4. Then, check if f1 * fx < 0. If so, swap x0 and x1, invert interval.\n\n5. Else, apply method.\n\n6. Then, set x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nWait, but step 6 would overwrite the x1 and f1 set in step 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to remove step 6, because the new code already sets x0 and x1 correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed after step 6, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should restructure the code.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAfter computing x and fx, and checking if fx is zero:\n\n- Check if x is within [x0, x1]. If not, adjust the interval.\n\n- Then, check if the new x is within the updated interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing if-else.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCompute x and fx.\n\nIf fx is zero, return.\n\nCheck if x is outside [x0, x1]. Adjust interval.\n\nThen, proceed with the existing logic.\n\nBut then, the existing logic may not need to set x1 = x and f1 = fx, because the new code has already done that.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed, because the new code handles updating the interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing if-else, and the x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx is part of the problem, because it doesn't account for x being outside the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nAfter computing x and fx, and handling the fx == 0 case:\n\n- Check if x is outside [x0, x1]. If so, update x0, x1, f0, f1.\n\n- Then, proceed to the existing logic, but without setting x1 = x and f1 = fx again.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfinal double x = ...;\nfinal double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n\nif (fx == 0.0) {\n    return x;\n}\n\n// Update interval bounds if x is outside [x0, x1]\nif (x < x0) {\n    x1 = x0;\n    x0 = x;\n    f1 = f0;\n    f0 = fx;\n} else if (x > x1) {\n    x0 = x1;\n    x1 = x;\n    f0 = f1;\n    f1 = fx;\n}\n\n// Now, proceed with existing logic\nif (f1 * fx < 0) {\n    // invert interval\n    x0 = x1;\n    f0 = f1;\n    inverted = !inverted;\n} else {\n    switch (method) {\n    case ILLINOIS:\n        f0 *= 0.5;\n        break;\n    case PEGASUS:\n        f0 *= f1 / (f1 + fx);\n        break;\n    // ...\n    }\n}\n\n// Remove the x1 = x and f1 = fx lines here.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the if-else, it sets x1 = x and f1 = fx. So, perhaps that's incorrect because the new code has already updated x0 and x1.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to remove those lines.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the x1 = x and f1 = fx are outside the if-else. So, regardless of whether the if condition was met, x1 is set to x and f1 to fx.\n\nSo, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing if-else, and then the x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed after the existing if-else, but that might not solve the problem.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to outline the correct flow.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that after computing x, the interval [x0, x1] is updated correctly, whether x is inside or outside.\n\nSo, the steps should be:\n\n1. Compute x and fx.\n\n2. If fx is zero, return x.\n\n3. Check if x is outside [x0, x1]. If so, adjust the interval.\n\n4. Then, check if the function values at the new interval ends bracket a root.\n\n5. Update the interval accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the existing code's if (f1 * fx < 0) is meant to handle the bracketing, but it doesn't account for x being outside the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the new code should handle the case where x is outside, and then the existing code can handle the bracketing.\n\nBut I'm concerned that the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx lines are causing the interval to be set incorrectly after the new code has adjusted it.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is:\n\n- Insert the new code after computing fx and checking if it's zero.\n\n- Then, remove the x1 = x and f1 = fx lines from the original code.\n\nBecause, after the new code, x0 and x1 are already updated, so setting x1 = x again would be incorrect.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after the new code, the existing if-else should proceed without updating x1 and f1 again.\n\nSo, the fixed code would look like:\n\nCompute x and fx.\n\nIf fx is zero, return.\n\nCheck if x is outside and update interval.\n\nThen, check if f1 * fx < 0, etc.\n\nAnd remove the lines x1 = x; f1 = fx; at the end of the loop.\n\nWait, but in the original code, those lines are inside the loop, after the if-else.\n\nSo, perhaps the fixed code should have the new code inserted, and then the x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed.\n\nLet me adjust the code accordingly.\n\nSo, the fixed function would have:\n\nAfter computing x and fx, and checking if fx is zero:\n\nInsert the new if-else block to update x0, x1, f0, f1.\n\nThen, proceed with the existing if-else (checking f1 * fx < 0).\n\nThen, remove the lines x1 = x; f1 = fx; because the new code has already updated them.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the if-else, it sets x1 = x and f1 = fx regardless of the condition. So, perhaps that's incorrect and should be removed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing if-else, and then the x1 = x and f1 = fx should be kept, but only if x is within the interval.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should write the code step by step.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Compute x and fx.\n\n2. If fx is zero, return x.\n\n3. Check if x is outside [x0, x1]. If so, update x0, x1, f0, f1.\n\n4. Now, check if f1 * fx < 0. If yes, swap x0 and x1, invert the interval.\n\n5. Else, apply the method to update f0.\n\n6. Do NOT set x1 = x and f1 = fx again, because the new code has already done that.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after step 5, it sets x1 = x and f1 = fx, which would overwrite the changes made in step 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to remove steps 6 (x1 = x and f1 = fx) from the original code.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, after step 5, we don't set x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, the x1 = x and f1 = fx are part of the loop, so perhaps they are necessary for the next iteration.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original code's logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx are intended to update the interval for the next iteration, but they don't account for x being outside the interval.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- After computing x and fx, check if x is outside the interval and update x0, x1, f0, f1.\n\n- Then, proceed with the existing logic, which may further adjust the interval based on the function values.\n\n- Then, set x1 = x and f1 = fx for the next iteration.\n\nWait, but that would overwrite the changes made earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed before the existing logic, and then the existing logic can proceed as before, but without the x1 = x and f1 = fx lines.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar code or think about how the interval is managed.\n\nIn root-finding methods like the Illinois method, the interval is adjusted based on where the new approximation falls. If the new x is outside the current interval, the interval should be expanded to include x.\n\nSo, the new code correctly expands the interval when x is outside.\n\nBut then, the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx lines would set x1 back to x, which may not be necessary because the new code has already updated x0 and x1.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code's x1 = x and f1 = fx should be removed, because after the new code, x1 is already set correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should be placed after the existing if-else, but before setting x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct order is:\n\nCompute x and fx.\n\nIf fx is zero, return.\n\nCheck if x is outside, update interval.\n\nThen, check if f1 * fx < 0, etc.\n\nThen, set x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nBut that would overwrite the interval again.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new code should replace the existing logic that updates the interval.\n\nWait, perhaps the existing code's if (f1 * fx < 0) is meant to handle the case where the root is bracketed between x1 and x, but it doesn't handle when x is outside.\n\nSo, perhaps the new code should handle the outside case, and the existing code can handle the bracketing within the interval.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCompute x and fx.\n\nIf fx is zero, return.\n\nIf x is outside [x0, x1], update the interval.\n\nElse, check if f1 * fx < 0, etc.\n\nThen, set x1 = x and f1 = fx.\n\nWait, but in that case, the new code would handle the outside case, and the existing code would handle the inside case.\n\nBut then, the x1 = x and f1 = fx would still be necessary for the next iteration.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to write the code with the new block inserted after the fx computation and before the existing if-else.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nprotected final double doSolve() {\n    // ... initial setup ...\n\n    while (true) {\n        final double x = x1 - ((f1 * (x1 - x0)) / (f1 - f0));\n        final double fx = computeObjectiveValue(x);\n\n        if (fx == 0.0) {\n            return x;\n        }\n\n        // Update interval bounds if x is outside [x0, x1]\n        if (x < x0) {\n            x1 = x0;\n            x0 = x;\n            f1 = f0;\n            f0 = fx;\n        } else if (x > x1) {\n            x0 = x1;\n            x1 = x;\n            f0 = f1;\n            f1 = fx;\n        }\n\n        if (f1 * fx < 0) {\n            // invert interval\n            x0 = x1;\n            f0 = f1;\n            inverted = !inverted;\n        } else {\n            switch (method) {\n            case ILLINOIS:\n                f0 *= 0.5;\n                break;\n            case PEGASUS:\n                f0 *= f1 / (f1 + fx);\n                break;\n            // ...\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Update x1 and f1 for next iteration\n        x1 = x;\n        f1 = fx;\n\n        // ... rest of the code ...\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this way, after the new code updates x0 and",
