      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode)` function always returns `false`, indicating that there is no exception handler for the given node. However, the trigger test creates a function with two try-catch blocks, which implies that there are exception handlers for the nodes in the control flow graph. This inconsistency between the `hasExceptionHandler` function and the trigger test causes the bug.\nSuggestion: Check for Try-Catch Blocks\nCheck if the given node is a try-catch block by checking its type. If it is a try-catch block, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`. This fix assumes that the presence of a try-catch block implies the presence of an exception handler.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate boolean hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode) {\n  return false;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6.
