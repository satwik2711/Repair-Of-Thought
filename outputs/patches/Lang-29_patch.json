      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of this bug is that the function toJavaVersionInt is returning a float value (0.0) instead of an integer value (0) when the input is null. This is because the function is using the return type float, which is a primitive type that cannot be null. When the input is null, the function is returning the default value of float, which is 0.0.\nSuggestion: Change the return type of the function toJavaVersionInt to int\nThe function toJavaVersionInt should return an integer value instead of a float value. This can be achieved by changing the return type of the function to int. The corrected function would look like this:\nstatic int toJavaVersionInt(String version) {\n    return toVersionInt(toJavaVersionIntArray(version, JAVA_VERSION_TRIM_SIZE));\n}\n// Buggy Function\nstatic float toJavaVersionInt(String version) {\n    return toVersionInt(toJavaVersionIntArray(version, JAVA_VERSION_TRIM_SIZE));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

When the input is null, the function is returning the default value of float, which is 0.0.\nSuggestion: Add a null check at the beginning of the function toJavaVersionInt\nThe function toJavaVersionInt should check if the input is null at the beginning and return 0 immediately if it is. This can be achieved by adding a null check at the beginning of the function. The corrected function would look like this:\nstatic float toJavaVersionInt(String version) {\n    if (version == null) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    return toVersionInt(toJavaVersionIntArray(version, JAVA_VERSION_TRIM_SIZE));\n}\n// Buggy Function\nstatic float toJavaVersionInt(String version) {\n    return toVersionInt(toJavaVersionIntArray(version, JAVA_VERSION_TRIM_SIZE));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

When the input is null, the function is returning the default value of float, which is 0.0.\nSuggestion: Use the ternary operator to return 0 when the input is null\nThe function toJavaVersionInt can use the ternary operator to return 0 when the input is null. This can be achieved by replacing the return statement with a ternary operator.
