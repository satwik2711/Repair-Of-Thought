      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of this bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the two input vectors are nearly parallel. In such cases, the cross-product should be close to zero, but the function is returning a non-zero value due to numerical instability. This is because the function is not using the preconditioning technique correctly, which is intended to reduce cancellation errors. Specifically, the function is not computing the value of rho, which is used to rescale the vectors before computing the cross-product.\nSuggestion: Implement Preconditioning Technique\nWe can fix this bug by implementing the preconditioning technique correctly. We need to compute the value of rho, which is used to rescale the vectors before computing the cross-product. We can do this by adding the following lines of code before computing the cross-product:\ndouble rho = (v1.dotProduct(v2)) / (v2.dotProduct(v2));\nVector3D v3 = v1.subtract(v2.multiply(rho));\nThen, we can compute the cross-product using v3 and v2 instead of v1 and v2.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static Vector3D crossProduct(final Vector3D v1, final Vector3D v2) {\n\n\n    // rescale both vectors without losing precision,\n    // to ensure their norm are the same order of magnitude\n\n    // we reduce cancellation errors by preconditioning,\n    // we replace v1 by v3 = v1 - rho v2 with rho chosen in order to compute\n    // v3 without loss of precision.

We can use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize the two input vectors before computing the cross-product. This method is more robust and can handle cases where the two input vectors are nearly parallel.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static Vector3D crossProduct(final Vector3D v1, final Vector3D v2) {\n\n\n    // rescale both vectors without losing precision,\n    // to ensure their norm are the same order of magnitude\n\n    // we reduce cancellation errors by preconditioning,\n    // we replace v1 by v3 = v1 - rho v2 with rho chosen in order to compute\n    // v3 without loss of precision.

Specifically, the function is not computing the value of rho, which is used to rescale the vectors before computing the cross-product.\nSuggestion: Check for Parallel Vectors\nWe can also fix this bug by checking if the two input vectors are parallel before computing the cross-product. If the vectors are parallel, we can return a zero vector instead of attempting to compute the cross-product.
