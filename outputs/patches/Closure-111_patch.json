      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The function caseTopType is not correctly handling the type when goog.isArray returns true. The function is simply returning the topType without any modification, which is causing the type mismatch. The function should return the type Array when goog.isArray returns true.\nSuggestion: Return Array Type\nThe function caseTopType can be modified to return the type Array when goog.isArray returns true. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the topType is an array and return the type Array accordingly. The modified function would look like this:\nprotected JSType caseTopType(JSType topType) {\n  if (topType.isArray()) {\n    return ARRAY_TYPE;\n  }\n  return topType;\n}\n// Buggy Function\nprotected JSType caseTopType(JSType topType) {\n  return topType;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The function is simply returning the topType without any modification, which is causing the type mismatch. The function should return the type Array when goog.isArray returns true.\nSuggestion: Use Type Checking\nThe function caseTopType can be modified to use type checking to determine if the topType is an array. This can be achieved by using the isSubtype function to check if the topType is a subtype of the Array type. The modified function would look like this:\nprotected JSType caseTopType(JSType topType) {\n  if (topType.isSubtype(ARRAY_TYPE)) {\n    return ARRAY_TYPE;\n  }\n  return topType;\n}\n// Buggy Function\nprotected JSType caseTopType(JSType topType) {\n  return topType;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The modified function would look like this:\nprotected JSType caseTopType(JSType topType) {\n  JSType arrayType = topType.toMaybeArrayType();\n  if (arrayType != null) {\n    return arrayType;\n  }\n  return topType;\n}\n// Buggy Function\nprotected JSType caseTopType(JSType topType) {\n  return topType;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
