      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the safeMultiply function. The problem is that when multiplying val1 and val2, the product might overflow the long range, and the current check isn't handling all cases correctly. \n\nSo, looking at the root cause, the issue happens when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1. Their product is Long.MAX_VALUE + 1, which is outside the long range. The current check, total / val2 != val1, doesn't catch this because when you divide Long.MIN_VALUE by -1, you get Long.MAX_VALUE, which isn't equal to val1 (Long.MIN_VALUE), so it throws an exception. Wait, no, actually in that case, the check does catch it because total is Long.MIN_VALUE, and dividing by -1 gives Long.MAX_VALUE, which is not equal to val1. So why is there an assertion failure? Maybe the original function isn't correctly handling that case because the multiplication itself is causing an overflow, and the check isn't sufficient.\n\nThe suggestion is to check for overflow before multiplying. So, I should add conditions to see if the multiplication would cause an overflow without actually performing it.\n\nLet me think about the conditions where overflow can happen. \n\nIf val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is less than -1, then multiplying would cause an overflow because Long.MIN_VALUE is negative and the product would be a very large positive number, exceeding Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSimilarly, if val1 is Long.MAX_VALUE and val2 is greater than 1, multiplying would exceed the positive long range.\n\nSo, I should add these checks before performing the multiplication.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Handle the switch cases as before for val2 being -1, 0, or 1. These are simple and can return immediately.\n\n2. For other cases, before multiplying, check if the multiplication would cause an overflow.\n\n3. The overflow conditions are:\n   a. val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 < -1\n   b. val1 is Long.MAX_VALUE and val2 > 1\n\n4. If either condition is true, throw an ArithmeticException.\n\n5. Otherwise, proceed with the multiplication and the existing check.\n\nWait, but what about other cases where the product might overflow? For example, if val1 is a large positive number and val2 is a large positive number, their product could exceed Long.MAX_VALUE. But checking all possible cases before multiplication might be complex. However, the suggestion is to handle these specific edge cases where the current check fails.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach of checking after multiplication isn't sufficient, so adding these specific checks can cover the problematic cases.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, after handling the switch cases, I'll add these two conditions. If either is true, throw an exception. Otherwise, proceed with the multiplication and the existing check.\n\nWait, but what about when val2 is negative and not -1? For example, val1 is positive and val2 is a large negative number. Or other combinations. Maybe the initial approach misses some cases, but the specific edge cases mentioned are the main culprits.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nAfter the switch, check:\n\nif (val1 == Long.MIN_VALUE && val2 < -1) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(...);\n}\nif (val1 == Long.MAX_VALUE && val2 > 1) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(...);\n}\n\nThen, compute total = val1 * val2.\n\nThen, perform the existing check: if (total / val2 != val1), throw.\n\nWait, but why do we still need the existing check? Because there might be other overflow cases that the initial conditions don't cover. For example, val1 is 2^62 and val2 is 2, which would exceed Long.MAX_VALUE. The initial conditions wouldn't catch this because val1 isn't Long.MAX_VALUE. So, the existing check is still necessary.\n\nBut wait, when val1 is 2^62, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE? No, because Long.MAX_VALUE is 2^63 -1. So 2^62 is less than that. So 2^62 * 2 is 2^63, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE, so it overflows. But in that case, the initial conditions wouldn't catch it because val1 isn't Long.MAX_VALUE. So, the existing check would catch it because total would be incorrect.\n\nHmm, but in the case where val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, the product is Long.MAX_VALUE +1, which is outside of long. But when you multiply, in Java, it overflows and wraps around. So, the result would actually be Long.MIN_VALUE because of two's complement. So, when you do total / val2, which is -1, you get Long.MAX_VALUE, which is not equal to val1 (Long.MIN_VALUE), so the check correctly throws an exception.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the function would throw an exception in that case. So why is there an assertion failure? Maybe the original code isn't handling that case correctly because the multiplication is causing an overflow, but the check is passing.\n\nWait, let me test this scenario:\n\nval1 = Long.MIN_VALUE (-9223372036854775808)\nval2 = -1\n\ntotal = val1 * val2 = 9223372036854775808, which is Long.MAX_VALUE +1, but since it's a long, it overflows to -9223372036854775808 (Long.MIN_VALUE).\n\nThen, total / val2 is (-9223372036854775808) / (-1) = 9223372036854775808, which is outside the range of long, so it wraps to -9223372036854775808 again? Or does it become Long.MAX_VALUE?\n\nWait, no. Let me think: in Java, dividing Long.MIN_VALUE by -1 gives Long.MAX_VALUE because mathematically, (-Long.MIN_VALUE) is Long.MAX_VALUE. But since long is 64-bit two's complement, dividing Long.MIN_VALUE by -1 can't be represented as a positive long because it's 2^63, which is beyond the maximum positive value (2^63 -1). So, in Java, what happens is that it results in Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nWait, no. Let me check: \n\nLong.MIN_VALUE is -2^63, which is -9223372036854775808.\n\nDivided by -1, it's 9223372036854775808, which is 2^63. But a long can only go up to 2^63 -1. So, in Java, this would cause an overflow, but since it's a division, it would result in 9223372036854775808L, but that's not possible because it's beyond the maximum. So, in reality, it would wrap around to -9223372036854775808 again? Or does it throw an exception?\n\nWait, no, division in Java for longs doesn't throw exceptions for overflow. So, when you divide Long.MIN_VALUE by -1, the result is Long.MAX_VALUE, because mathematically, it's 9223372036854775808, which is 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF in hex, but wait, 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF is 2^63 -1, which is Long.MAX_VALUE. Wait, no, 9223372036854775808 is 2^63, which is one more than Long.MAX_VALUE. So, how does Java handle this?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of two's complement. Long.MIN_VALUE is 0x8000000000000000. When you divide by -1, it's equivalent to multiplying by -1 again. So, 0x8000000000000000 * (-1) is 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, which is Long.MAX_VALUE. So, in Java, Long.MIN_VALUE / -1 is Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, in the original code, when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, total is Long.MIN_VALUE (because val1 * val2 overflows). Then, total / val2 is Long.MAX_VALUE, which is not equal to val1 (Long.MIN_VALUE), so the check throws an exception. So why is the original code failing?\n\nWait, maybe the original code isn't handling the case where the multiplication itself overflows, but the check is still catching it. So why is there an assertion failure? Maybe the problem is that the multiplication is causing an overflow, but the check is not sufficient in some other cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original code is correct, but the test case expects it to return a certain value without throwing an exception, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the current implementation's check is flawed. So, perhaps in some cases, the product overflows, but the check doesn't catch it.\n\nWait, another example: val1 = Long.MAX_VALUE, val2 = 2. The product is 2 * Long.MAX_VALUE, which is 2^64 - 2, which is way beyond Long.MAX_VALUE. So, when you multiply, it overflows to some negative number. Then, when you do total / val2, which is (negative number) / 2, it may not equal val1. So, the check would catch it. But perhaps in some cases, it doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, the product is Long.MAX_VALUE +1, which is outside the long range. But in Java, when you multiply, it wraps around, so the result is Long.MIN_VALUE. Then, when you do total / val2 (which is -1), you get Long.MAX_VALUE, which is not equal to val1 (Long.MIN_VALUE), so the check correctly throws an exception. So why is the original code causing an assertion failure? Maybe the test case expects the function to return Long.MAX_VALUE +1, but since it's not possible, it's an overflow, so the function should throw. So perhaps the original code is correct, but the test case is expecting a different behavior.\n\nWait, perhaps the original code is not handling the case where val2 is 0 correctly, but that's unlikely because the switch handles val2=0.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The root cause says that the current check is flawed because when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, the product is outside the long range, but the check passes. Wait, no, in that case, the check would throw because total / val2 != val1.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nval1 = Long.MIN_VALUE (-9223372036854775808)\nval2 = -1\n\ntotal = val1 * val2 = 9223372036854775808, which is beyond Long.MAX_VALUE, so it overflows. In Java, multiplying a long by another long is done in two's complement, so the result would be -9223372036854775808 (Long.MIN_VALUE) because it's an overflow.\n\nSo, total is Long.MIN_VALUE.\n\nThen, total / val2 is Long.MIN_VALUE / (-1) = Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, the check is: if (Long.MAX_VALUE != val1) \u2192 which is true because val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE. So, the check throws an exception.\n\nSo, in this case, the original code correctly throws an exception. So why is there an assertion failure? Maybe the test case expects the function to return Long.MAX_VALUE +1, but that's impossible, so the function correctly throws.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the function is not throwing when it should. Or maybe the function is throwing when it shouldn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, the product is Long.MAX_VALUE +1, which is outside the range, but the function's check doesn't catch it because the division wraps around.\n\nWait, no, because the function does catch it. So, perhaps the problem is elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the original code doesn't handle when val2 is positive and val1 is such that their product overflows. For example, val1 = 3e18 and val2 = 2. The product is 6e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (about 9e18). Wait, no, Long.MAX_VALUE is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, which is approximately 9e18. So 6e18 is less than that. Hmm, maybe another example.\n\nWait, perhaps when val1 is 2^62 and val2 is 2, the product is 2^63, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE. So, the product would overflow, but the check may not catch it.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\nval1 = 1L << 62 \u2192 4,611,686,018,427,387,904\nval2 = 2\n\ntotal = val1 * val2 \u2192 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, which is 2^63, which is one more than Long.MAX_VALUE. So, in Java, this overflows to -9,223,372,036,854,775,808, which is Long.MIN_VALUE.\n\nThen, total / val2 is (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808) / 2 \u2192 -4,611,686,018,427,387,904, which is equal to val1. So, the check (total / val2 != val1) would be false, so it doesn't throw an exception, even though the multiplication overflowed.\n\nAh, that's the problem. So, in this case, the product overflows, but the check doesn't catch it because (total / val2) equals val1.\n\nSo, the original code's check is insufficient because in some cases, the overflowed result, when divided by val2, gives back val1, thus not triggering the exception.\n\nSo, the root cause is that the current check doesn't catch all overflow cases. Therefore, the suggestion is to check for potential overflow before performing the multiplication.\n\nSo, the solution is to add checks before multiplying to see if the multiplication would cause an overflow.\n\nThe suggested conditions are:\n\n1. If val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 < -1 \u2192 multiplying would cause overflow because Long.MIN_VALUE * (-1) is Long.MAX_VALUE +1, which is outside the range. But wait, if val2 is -2, then val1 * val2 is (Long.MIN_VALUE) * (-2) = 1.844674407370955e+19, which is way beyond Long.MAX_VALUE. So, this condition would catch that.\n\n2. If val1 is Long.MAX_VALUE and val2 > 1 \u2192 multiplying would cause overflow because Long.MAX_VALUE * 2 is 1.844674407370955e+19, which is beyond Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, adding these two conditions before the multiplication would catch these specific overflow cases.\n\nBut wait, what about other cases where val1 is a large positive number and val2 is a large positive number, causing overflow? For example, val1 = 5e18 and val2 = 2 \u2192 product is 1e19, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE. The initial conditions wouldn't catch this because val1 isn't Long.MAX_VALUE. So, perhaps the initial conditions are not sufficient, but they address the specific cases mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial conditions plus the existing check would cover all cases.\n\nWait, in the example I had earlier where val1 is 1L << 62 and val2 is 2, the initial conditions wouldn't trigger because val1 isn't Long.MAX_VALUE. So, the multiplication proceeds, and the existing check doesn't catch it because (total / val2) == val1. So, the function would return an incorrect value without throwing an exception.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial conditions are not enough. But according to the problem statement, the suggestion is to add these specific checks. So, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, after handling the switch cases, I'll add:\n\nif (val1 == Long.MIN_VALUE && val2 < -1) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(...);\n}\nif (val1 == Long.MAX_VALUE && val2 > 1) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(...);\n}\n\nThen, compute total = val1 * val2.\n\nThen, perform the existing check: if (total / val2 != val1), throw.\n\nWait, but in the example where val1 is 1L << 62 and val2 is 2, the initial conditions don't trigger, so the multiplication proceeds. The product overflows, but the check doesn't catch it. So, the function would return the overflowed value, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial conditions are not sufficient. Maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should check whether the multiplication would overflow before performing it, using a different method.\n\nAnother approach is to use the following condition to check for overflow:\n\nif (val2 != 0 && (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2 || val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2)) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(...);\n}\n\nBut this approach has issues when val2 is negative, because dividing Long.MIN_VALUE by a negative val2 could cause overflow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the approach from the Java standard libraries, such as Long.multiplyExact, which throws an exception if the multiplication overflows.\n\nWait, but Long.multiplyExact is available in Java 8 and later. Since the original code is using a custom implementation, perhaps it's better to replicate the logic.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to check if the multiplication would overflow before performing it.\n\nThe standard way to check for overflow in multiplication is:\n\nif (val1 > 0) {\n    if (val2 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val1) {\n        // overflow\n    }\n} else if (val1 < 0) {\n    if (val2 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val1) {\n        // overflow\n    }\n} else {\n    // val1 is 0, no overflow\n}\n\nBut this can get complicated, especially with negative numbers.\n\nAlternatively, using the approach from the suggestion, which is to handle the specific cases where the product would definitely overflow.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, I'll add the two conditions as suggested, and then proceed with the multiplication and the existing check.\n\nSo, the fixed function would look like this:\n\npublic static long safeMultiply(long val1, int val2) {\n    switch (val2) {\n        case -1:\n            return -val1;\n        case 0:\n            return 0L;\n        case 1:\n            return val1;\n    }\n    if (val1 == Long.MIN_VALUE && val2 < -1) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Multiplication overflows a long: \" + val1 + \" * \" + val2);\n    }\n    if (val1 == Long.MAX_VALUE && val2 > 1) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Multiplication overflows a long: \" + val1 + \" * \" + val2);\n    }\n    long total = val1 * val2;\n    if (total / val2 != val1) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Multiplication overflows a long: \" + val1 + \" * \" + val2);\n    }\n    return total;\n}\n\nWait, but in the example where val1 is 1L << 62 and val2 is 2, the initial conditions don't trigger, so the multiplication proceeds. The product is 1L << 63, which is Long.MIN_VALUE. Then, total / val2 is (Long.MIN_VALUE) / 2, which is -4611686018427387904, which is equal to val1 (1L << 62 is 4611686018427387904). So, the check (total / val2 != val1) would be false, so no exception is thrown, and the function returns Long.MIN_VALUE, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the function still doesn't handle this case correctly. Therefore, the initial fix is insufficient.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial suggestion isn't enough. Maybe a better approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function should use a different method to check for overflow, such as using a wider data type, like BigInteger, to check if the product exceeds Long's range.\n\nBut that might be overkill and could affect performance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function can compute the maximum possible val2 for a given val1 without causing overflow.\n\nSo, for positive val1:\n\nmaxVal2 = Long.MAX_VALUE / val1\n\nif val2 > maxVal2, overflow.\n\nFor negative val1:\n\nminVal2 = Long.MIN_VALUE / val1\n\nif val2 < minVal2, overflow.\n\nBut this requires careful handling, especially when val1 is negative.\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nIf val1 is positive:\n\nThe maximum product without overflow is Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, val2 must be <= Long.MAX_VALUE / val1.\n\nIf val1 is negative:\n\nThe minimum product without overflow is Long.MIN_VALUE.\n\nSo, val2 must be >= Long.MIN_VALUE / val1.\n\nBut wait, when val1 is negative, and val2 is positive, the product is negative, so the maximum negative product is Long.MIN_VALUE.\n\nSo, for val1 < 0 and val2 > 0:\n\nif val1 * val2 < Long.MIN_VALUE \u2192 overflow.\n\nWhich can be checked by val2 > Long.MIN_VALUE / val1.\n\nBut since val1 is negative, dividing Long.MIN_VALUE by val1 (which is negative) would give a positive number.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the maximum allowed val2 for a given val1.\n\nSo, the logic would be:\n\nif (val2 != 0) {\n    if (val1 > 0) {\n        if (val2 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val1) {\n            throw exception;\n        }\n    } else if (val1 < 0) {\n        if (val2 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val1) {\n            throw exception;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, let's test this with val1 = Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 = -1.\n\nval1 is negative, val2 is negative.\n\nSo, val1 * val2 is positive.\n\nLong.MIN_VALUE is -9223372036854775808.\n\nLong.MIN_VALUE / val1 (which is -1) is 9223372036854775808, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9223372036854775807). So, val2 (-1) is less than 9223372036854775808, so the condition (val2 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val1) would be true, and the exception is thrown.\n\nWhich is correct because val1 * val2 would be 9223372036854775808, which is beyond Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nAnother test case: val1 = 1L << 62 (4611686018427387904), val2 = 2.\n\nval1 is positive, so check if val2 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val1.\n\nLong.MAX_VALUE is 9223372036854775807.\n\n9223372036854775807 / 4611686018427387904 = 2 exactly (since 4611686018427387904 * 2 = 9223372036854775808, which is 1 more than Long.MAX_VALUE). So, 2 is greater than 2? No, it's equal. So, the condition would not trigger, but the multiplication would overflow.\n\nSo, this approach would miss this case.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the condition should be val2 > (Long.MAX_VALUE / val1). But in this case, val2 is equal to (Long.MAX_VALUE / val1) + 1? Wait, no.\n\nWait, 4611686018427387904 * 2 = 9223372036854775808, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9223372036854775807). So, the maximum allowed val2 is 1, because 4611686018427387904 * 2 is beyond the limit.\n\nSo, in this case, Long.MAX_VALUE / val1 is 9223372036854775807 /",
      "public static long safeMultiply(long val1, int val2) {\n    BigInteger product = BigInteger.valueOf(val1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(val2));\n    if (product.compareTo(BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE)) > 0 || \n        product.compareTo(BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE)) < 0) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Multiplication overflows a long: \" + val1 + \" * \" + val2);\n    }\n    return product.longValue();\n}",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the safeMultiply function. The problem is that the current overflow check isn't handling all cases correctly, especially when the product exceeds the range of long. \n\nLooking at the root cause, when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, the product is Long.MAX_VALUE + 1, which overflows. The current check (total / val2 != val1) fails to catch this because dividing Long.MIN_VALUE by -1 gives Long.MAX_VALUE, which isn't equal to val1 (Long.MIN_VALUE), so it throws an exception. Wait, actually, in this case, the check does catch it because total is Long.MIN_VALUE, and dividing by -1 gives Long.MAX_VALUE, which isn't equal to val1. So why is there an issue?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, right, the problem is that the initial approach doesn't correctly handle cases where the multiplication overflows, but the division check doesn't catch it because of how integer division works with negative numbers.\n\nThe suggestion is to check if the product would exceed Long.MAX_VALUE or be less than Long.MIN_VALUE. So, instead of relying on the division check, we should compute whether val1 is too big when multiplied by val2.\n\nSo, how do I implement that? Let's think about the conditions.\n\nFor positive val2:\n- If val2 is positive, then if val1 exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE / val2, the product will overflow.\n- Similarly, if val1 is less than Long.MIN_VALUE / val2, it will underflow.\n\nFor negative val2:\n- The logic is similar but needs to handle the signs correctly. Maybe it's better to compute the maximum and minimum possible values that can be multiplied without overflow.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to check if the absolute value of val1 is greater than (Long.MAX_VALUE) / (absolute value of val2). If so, overflow occurs. But I also need to consider the signs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute the maximum and minimum possible values that can be multiplied by val2 without causing overflow.\n\nSo, for a given val2, the maximum val1 can be is Long.MAX_VALUE / val2, but only if val2 is positive. If val2 is negative, then the maximum would be (Long.MAX_VALUE) / val2, but since val2 is negative, it's actually a lower bound.\n\nHmm, maybe I should compute the maximum positive and minimum negative values that can be multiplied by val2 without causing overflow.\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard way to check for multiplication overflow:\n\nif (val2 != 0) {\n    if (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2 || val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but this might not handle all cases correctly, especially when val2 is negative. For example, if val2 is negative, dividing Long.MAX_VALUE by val2 could result in a negative number, and comparing val1 (which could be positive) might not work.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to handle the cases where val2 is positive and negative separately.\n\nLet me think about the conditions:\n\nIf val2 is positive:\n- The maximum product is Long.MAX_VALUE, so val1 must be <= Long.MAX_VALUE / val2.\n- The minimum product is Long.MIN_VALUE, so val1 must be >= Long.MIN_VALUE / val2.\n\nIf val2 is negative:\n- Since multiplying by a negative val2 reverses the inequality, the maximum product would be when val1 is as small as possible, and the minimum when val1 is as large as possible.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the maximum and minimum possible val1 for a given val2.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the product and then check if it's outside the range of long, but that's not possible because once it overflows, the value wraps around.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to check before multiplying whether the multiplication would cause an overflow.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Handle the special cases where val2 is -1, 0, or 1, as the original function does. These cases can be handled without any multiplication, so they're safe.\n\n2. For other values of val2, check if multiplying val1 by val2 would cause an overflow.\n\n3. To check for overflow, determine if val1 is outside the range that can be multiplied by val2 without exceeding Long.MAX_VALUE or going below Long.MIN_VALUE.\n\nSo, let's formalize the condition:\n\nIf val2 is positive:\n- The maximum val1 can be is Long.MAX_VALUE / val2.\n- The minimum val1 can be is Long.MIN_VALUE / val2.\n\nBut wait, since val2 is positive, dividing Long.MIN_VALUE by val2 will give a negative value, which is correct.\n\nIf val2 is negative:\n- The maximum val1 can be is Long.MAX_VALUE / val2, but since val2 is negative, this is equivalent to Long.MAX_VALUE divided by a negative number, which could be a very negative number. Hmm, perhaps I should take absolute values.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to compute the maximum and minimum possible products and see if val1 * val2 would be within the long range.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, here's a method that's often used:\n\npublic static long safeMultiply(long val1, int val2) {\n    if (val2 == 0) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (val2 == 1) {\n        return val1;\n    }\n    if (val2 == -1) {\n        return -val1;\n    }\n    if (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2 || val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Overflow\");\n    }\n    return val1 * val2;\n}\n\nWait, but this might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if val2 is negative, the division might not give the correct bounds.\n\nWait, let's test with val1 = Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 = -1.\n\nLong.MAX_VALUE is 9223372036854775807.\n\nLong.MIN_VALUE is -9223372036854775808.\n\nSo, for val2 = -1:\n\nCheck if val1 > (Long.MAX_VALUE / (-1)) => Long.MAX_VALUE / -1 is -9223372036854775808.\n\nval1 is Long.MIN_VALUE, which is -9223372036854775808.\n\nSo, val1 > (Long.MAX_VALUE / val2) is (-9223372036854775808) > (-9223372036854775808)? No, it's equal. So the condition is false.\n\nThen check if val1 < (Long.MIN_VALUE / val2). Long.MIN_VALUE is -9223372036854775808, divided by -1 is 9223372036854775808.\n\nSo val1 (-9223372036854775808) < 9223372036854775808? Yes. So the condition is true, and it throws an exception.\n\nWhich is correct because Long.MIN_VALUE * (-1) is 9223372036854775808, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9223372036854775807), so it overflows.\n\nSo in this case, the condition correctly throws an exception.\n\nAnother test case: val1 = 2, val2 = 3. Long.MAX_VALUE /3 is about 3e18. 2 is less than that, so no exception.\n\nAnother case: val1 = Long.MAX_VALUE, val2 = 2. Long.MAX_VALUE /2 is 4611686018427387903. val1 is 9223372036854775807, which is larger, so condition is true, exception is thrown.\n\nWhat about val1 = -1 and val2 = -2. Long.MIN_VALUE / val2 is (-9223372036854775808)/(-2) = 4611686018427387904. val1 is -1, which is greater than 4611686018427387904? No, because -1 is less than that positive number. So condition is false, no exception. The product is 2, which is correct.\n\nWait, but wait: val1 is -1, val2 is -2. The product is 2, which is within long range. So no exception should be thrown. So the condition correctly allows it.\n\nAnother test case: val1 = 3, val2 = 4. 3*4=12, which is fine.\n\nWhat about val1 = Long.MAX_VALUE - 1, val2 = 2. (Long.MAX_VALUE -1) is 9223372036854775806. 9223372036854775806 *2 = 18446744073709551612, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE. So the condition should catch it.\n\nLong.MAX_VALUE /2 is 4611686018427387903. val1 is 9223372036854775806, which is larger than 4611686018427387903, so condition is true, exception is thrown.\n\nSo this seems to handle the cases correctly.\n\nWait, but what if val2 is a negative number, say -2, and val1 is a large negative number.\n\nFor example, val1 = -3000000000000000000, val2 = -2.\n\nLong.MAX_VALUE / val2 is 9223372036854775807 / (-2) = -4611686018427387903.\n\nval1 is -3e18, which is less than -4611686018427387903? No, because -3e18 is more negative. So val1 < (Long.MIN_VALUE / val2)?\n\nWait, Long.MIN_VALUE is -9223372036854775808. Divided by val2 (-2) is 4611686018427387904.\n\nSo val1 (-3e18) < 4611686018427387904? Yes, because -3e18 is a very negative number, which is less than a positive 4e18. So condition is true, exception is thrown.\n\nBut wait, val1 * val2 is (-3e18) * (-2) = 6e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9e18 is way larger than 9e18? Wait, Long.MAX_VALUE is 9e18 approximately. 6e18 is less than that. So 6e18 is within the range. So the condition would incorrectly throw an exception.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So in this case, the condition is incorrectly triggering.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the approach isn't correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in this example, val1 is -3e18, val2 is -2.\n\nval1 * val2 = 6e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (which is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807). Wait, 6e18 is 6,000,000,000,000,000,000. Long.MAX_VALUE is about 9e18, so 6e18 is less than that. So the product is 6e18, which is within the long range. So the function should not throw an exception.\n\nBut according to the condition, val1 < (Long.MIN_VALUE / val2). Let's compute:\n\nLong.MIN_VALUE is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808. Divided by val2 (-2) is 4,611,686,018,427,387,904.\n\nval1 is -3e18, which is -3,000,000,000,000,000,000.\n\nIs -3e18 < 4.6e18? Yes, because -3e18 is a negative number, and 4.6e18 is positive. So the condition (val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) is true, which would throw an exception, but in reality, the product is within the long range.\n\nSo this approach is flawed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the condition isn't sufficient. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: compute the product, but before that, check if the multiplication would cause an overflow by comparing against the maximum and minimum possible values.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nif (val2 > 0) {\n    if (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n    if (val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n} else {\n    // val2 is negative\n    if (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2) { // since val2 is negative, division flips inequality\n        throw exception;\n    }\n    if (val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) { // same here\n        throw exception;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, let's test this with the previous example.\n\nval1 = -3e18, val2 = -2.\n\nval2 is negative, so we enter the else block.\n\nCheck if val1 > (Long.MAX_VALUE / val2). Long.MAX_VALUE is 9e18, divided by -2 is -4.5e18.\n\nval1 is -3e18, which is greater than -4.5e18. So condition is true, throw exception. But in reality, the product is 6e18, which is within the range. So this approach is also incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a standard way to check for multiplication overflow in Java.\n\nUpon checking, I recall that the standard approach is to check if the product exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE or is less than Long.MIN_VALUE, but since we can't compute the product directly without overflowing, we need to do it via division.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nif (val2 != 0 && (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2 || val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2)) {\n    throw new ArithmeticException(...);\n}\n\nBut as we saw earlier, this can fail in some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that when val2 is negative, the division may not correctly represent the boundary.\n\nAlternative approach: use the Math.multiplyExact method, but that's only available in Java 8 and later, and it's for integers, not longs. So not helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the maximum and minimum possible values for val1 given val2.\n\nThe maximum possible val1 without overflow is floor(Long.MAX_VALUE / val2).\n\nThe minimum possible val1 is ceil(Long.MIN_VALUE / val2).\n\nWait, but how to compute that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition should be:\n\nif (val2 > 0) {\n    if (val1 > Long.MAX_VALUE / val2) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n    if (val1 < Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) {\n        throw exception;\n    }\n} else {\n    // val2 is negative\n    if (val1 < Long.MAX_VALUE / val2) { // because dividing by negative flips inequality\n        throw exception;\n    }\n    if (val1 > Long.MIN_VALUE / val2) { // same here\n        throw exception;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, let's test this with val1 = -3e18, val2 = -2.\n\nval2 is negative, so:\n\nCheck if val1 < (Long.MAX_VALUE / val2). Long.MAX_VALUE is 9e18, divided by -2 is -4.5e18.\n\nval1 is -3e18, which is greater than -4.5e18, so condition is false.\n\nNext, check if val1 > (Long.MIN_VALUE / val2). Long.MIN_VALUE is -9.2e18, divided by -2 is 4.6e18.\n\nval1 is -3e18, which is less than 4.6e18, so condition is false.\n\nSo no exception is thrown, which is correct because the product is 6e18, which is within the long range.\n\nAnother test case: val1 = Long.MIN_VALUE, val2 = -1.\n\nval2 is negative.\n\nCheck if val1 < (Long.MAX_VALUE / val2). Long.MAX_VALUE / -1 is -9.2e18.\n\nval1 is -9.2e18, which is equal, so condition is false.\n\nNext, check if val1 > (Long.MIN_VALUE / val2). Long.MIN_VALUE is -9.2e18, divided by -1 is 9.2e18.\n\nval1 is -9.2e18, which is less than 9.2e18, so condition is false. So no exception is thrown, but the product is 9.2e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9.2e18 -1), so it should throw.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the condition isn't catching this case.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternative idea: compute the maximum and minimum possible values that val1 can take without causing overflow when multiplied by val2.\n\nThe maximum product is Long.MAX_VALUE, so val1 must be <= Long.MAX_VALUE / val2.\n\nThe minimum product is Long.MIN_VALUE, so val1 must be >= Long.MIN_VALUE / val2.\n\nBut when val2 is negative, the division may not behave as expected.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nif (val2 != 0) {\n    long max = Long.MAX_VALUE / val2;\n    long min = Long.MIN_VALUE / val2;\n    if (val2 > 0) {\n        if (val1 > max || val1 < min) {\n            throw exception;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // val2 is negative, so the inequalities flip\n        if (val1 < max || val1 > min) {\n            throw exception;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nTest case 1: val1 = Long.MIN_VALUE, val2 = -1.\n\nval2 is -1, which is negative.\n\nmax = Long.MAX_VALUE / (-1) = -9.2e18.\n\nmin = Long.MIN_VALUE / (-1) = 9.2e18.\n\nSince val2 is negative, check if val1 < max OR val1 > min.\n\nval1 is -9.2e18.\n\nIs -9.2e18 < max (-9.2e18)? No, equal.\n\nIs -9.2e18 > min (9.2e18)? No.\n\nSo condition is false, no exception. But the product is 9.2e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9.2e18 -1), so it should throw.\n\nHmm, so this approach is also failing.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that in Java, the multiplication of two longs can be checked for overflow by using the following method:\n\npublic static long safeMultiply(long a, long b) {\n    long result = a * b;\n    if (a != 0 && b != 0 && (result / a != b)) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Overflow\");\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\nBut wait, this is similar to the original code, which had issues.\n\nWait, in the original code, the condition is (total / val2 != val1). But when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1, total is Long.MIN_VALUE, and total / val2 is Long.MAX_VALUE, which is not equal to val1, so it throws. But in reality, the product is Long.MAX_VALUE +1, which overflows. So the condition correctly throws.\n\nWait, but according to the root cause, the original code doesn't handle this case correctly. So perhaps the original code is correct, but the root cause analysis is wrong?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the original code, when val1 is Long.MIN_VALUE and val2 is -1:\n\ntotal = Long.MIN_VALUE * (-1) = Long.MAX_VALUE + 1, which overflows to Long.MIN_VALUE (because of two's complement). So total is Long.MIN_VALUE.\n\nThen, the condition is total / val2 != val1.\n\ntotal is Long.MIN_VALUE, val2 is -1.\n\nLong.MIN_VALUE / (-1) is Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nSo, Long.MAX_VALUE != val1 (Long.MIN_VALUE), so condition is true, exception is thrown.\n\nWhich is correct because the product overflows.\n\nSo why is the root cause saying that the current implementation is flawed? Because in this case, the condition correctly throws an exception.\n\nWait, perhaps the root cause is incorrect, and the original code is correct. But that can't be, because the user says that the function is buggy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root cause is referring to another scenario where the condition fails.\n\nWait, perhaps when val1 is 1 and val2 is Long.MAX_VALUE, but wait, val2 is an int, so it can't be Long.MAX_VALUE.\n\nWait, val2 is an int, so it's 32-bit. So val2 can be up to 2^31-1.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is when val2 is positive and val1 is such that val1 * val2 exceeds Long.MAX_VALUE, but the division check doesn't catch it.\n\nWait, let's take val1 = 3e18 and val2 = 3. 3e18 *3 is 9e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9.2e18). So the product is 9e18, which is within the range. Wait, no, 3e18 *3 is 9e18, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE (9,223,372,036,854,775,807) is approximately 9.2e18. So 9e18 is less than that. So no overflow.\n\nWait, perhaps another example: val1 = 3e18, val2 = 4. 3e18 *4 = 1.2e19, which is larger than Long.MAX_VALUE. So the product would overflow.\n\nIn the original code, total = 3e18 *4 = which overflows to some negative number.\n\nThen, the condition is total /4 != 3e18.\n\nBut 3e18 *4 is 1.2e19, which is beyond long's capacity, so it wraps around to a negative number. Let's say total is -x.\n\nThen, total /4 is (-x)/4, which is not equal to 3e18, so condition is true, exception is thrown.\n\nSo in this case, the original code correctly throws.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the original code is correct, but the root cause analysis is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the user, the function is buggy, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is when val1 is the minimum value and val2 is -1, but in that case, the original code correctly throws.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is when val1 is 1 and val2 is Long.MAX_VALUE, but val2 is an int, so it can't be that large.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when val2 is 1, the function returns val1 without checking for overflow. But that's correct because multiplying by 1 can't cause overflow.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for other test cases where the original code fails.\n\nAnother test case: val1 = 2^62, val2 = 2. 2^62 is 4,611,686,018,427,387,904. Multiplying by 2 gives 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, which is exactly Long.MAX_VALUE +1. So it overflows.\n\nIn the original code:\n\ntotal = 2^62 *2 = which is 9.2e18 +1, which is beyond long's capacity. So it wraps to -9.2e18 -1.\n\nThen, the condition is total /2 != 2^62.\n\ntotal is -9.2e18 -1, divided by 2 is -4.6e18 -0.5, which truncates to -4.6e18.\n\nIs -4.6e18 equal to 4.6e18? No, so condition is true, exception is thrown.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, so in all the test cases"
