      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `getValue()` function is not handling boolean attributes correctly. In HTML, boolean attributes like `hidden` do not have a value, but the `getValue()` function is returning `null` instead of an empty string.\nSuggestion: Check for Boolean Attributes\nCheck if the attribute is a boolean attribute and return an empty string if it is. This can be done by checking if the attribute value is `null` or an empty string. However, this approach requires additional logic to identify boolean attributes, which may not be feasible in this case.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String getValue() {\n    return val;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

In HTML, boolean attributes like `hidden` do not have a value, but the `getValue()` function is returning `null` instead of an empty string.\nSuggestion: Use a Default Value\nUse a default value of an empty string if the attribute value is `null`. This can be done by using the ternary operator to return an empty string if the attribute value is `null`. This approach is simple and effective, and it handles boolean attributes correctly by returning an empty string if the attribute value is `null`.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String getValue() {\n    return val;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

In HTML, boolean attributes like `hidden` do not have a value, but the `getValue()` function is returning `null` instead of an empty string.\nSuggestion: Handle Boolean Attributes Explicitly\nHandle boolean attributes explicitly by checking if the attribute key is a boolean attribute and return an empty string if it is. This can be done by maintaining a list of boolean attributes and checking if the attribute key is in that list. However, this approach requires additional logic and data structures to maintain the list of boolean attributes.\n\nThe final solution is to use\n// Buggy Function\npublic String getValue() {\n    return val;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
