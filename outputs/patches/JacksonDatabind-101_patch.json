      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped method. The issue is that the TokenBuffer isn't correctly handling the unwrapped fields after the last creator property. So, when the last creator property is processed, the code tries to copy the remaining tokens into the buffer, but it's not working as expected, causing data loss.\n\nLet me look at the original code. The method uses a TokenBuffer to collect the remaining fields after the last creator property. Inside the loop, when the last creator property is assigned, it reads the next token and then enters a while loop that copies the current structure into the tokens buffer. But maybe this isn't capturing all the necessary data.\n\nWait, the problem arises because after the last creator property, the code tries to copy the remaining tokens, but perhaps it's not handling all cases correctly. For example, if there are multiple fields after the last creator, the loop might not capture them all.\n\nLooking at the code, after assigning the last creator property, it does:\n\nt = p.nextToken(); // move to following FIELD_NAME/END_OBJECT\n...\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken();\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\nHmm, this seems to process each field, but perhaps it's not correctly handling nested structures or multiple fields. Also, after the loop, it writes the end object, but maybe the initial writeStartObject in tokens isn't properly closed.\n\nWait, the tokens buffer starts with writeStartObject(), and after processing all fields, it writes writeEndObject(). But when the creator is built, the tokens are passed to processUnwrapped. So maybe the issue is that the tokens buffer isn't correctly capturing all the remaining fields after the last creator property.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the while loop is exiting too early. Let me think about the token sequence. Suppose after the last creator property, the next tokens are FIELD_NAME, value, FIELD_NAME, value, and then END_OBJECT. The loop would process each FIELD_NAME, but after the last one, t would be END_OBJECT, so the loop stops. But does it process the last FIELD_NAME correctly?\n\nWait, in the loop, for each FIELD_NAME, it does p.nextToken() to get the value, then copies the structure. Then t is set to the next token. So for each field, it's correctly processed. But maybe when the last field is processed, the next token is END_OBJECT, so the loop stops. That seems correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not handling the case where after the last creator property, there are multiple fields, and the loop doesn't capture all of them because it's only processing FIELD_NAMEs. Or maybe the way the tokens are being copied is incorrect.\n\nWait, the original code uses tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p), which should copy the current structure starting from the current token. So when the parser is pointing to a FIELD_NAME, after p.nextToken(), it's pointing to the value. Then copyCurrentStructure should copy the field name and value. So each iteration of the loop should handle one field.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that after processing all the fields, the tokens buffer is not being properly closed or is missing some data. Or maybe the way the buffer is being used later is incorrect.\n\nAnother angle: the problem is that the code is using tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p) inside the loop, but perhaps it's not correctly appending all the remaining tokens, especially if there are nested objects or arrays. Maybe it should instead read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the buffer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to read all the remaining tokens after the last creator property and append them to the tokens buffer. So instead of looping through each FIELD_NAME, maybe we can read until the end of the object and copy everything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current approach misses some tokens because it's only processing FIELD_NAMEs, but after the last creator property, there might be other tokens like END_OBJECT, which aren't handled.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure. The main object starts with '{', then fields, then '}'. So after the last creator property, the parser is pointing to either FIELD_NAME or END_OBJECT. The loop correctly processes each FIELD_NAME and copies the structure. But when it hits END_OBJECT, it stops. So that should be fine.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the code is not handling the case where after the last creator property, the next token is END_OBJECT, meaning there are no more fields. In that case, the while loop doesn't execute, and the tokens buffer remains empty except for the start object. Then, when processUnwrapped is called, it might not have the necessary data.\n\nWait, but in that case, the tokens buffer would have the start and end object, which is an empty object. So maybe that's not the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last creator property is followed by multiple fields, and the loop doesn't capture all of them because it's not reading all the tokens.\n\nWait, another possibility: the code is using p.nextToken() inside the loop, which advances the parser, but the tokens buffer is being built from the parser's current position. So each time, it's copying the current structure, which should include the field name and value.\n\nBut perhaps the way the tokens are being copied is incorrect. Maybe instead of using copyCurrentStructure, which copies from the current position, it should be using a different method to capture all remaining content.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should collect all the remaining tokens after the last creator property into the tokens buffer, regardless of their type, until the end of the object.\n\nSo, maybe the approach should be: after the last creator property is processed, read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nIn the current code, the while loop only processes FIELD_NAME tokens. So any other tokens, like values, are not being processed. But wait, after the last creator property, the next token is either FIELD_NAME or END_OBJECT. So the loop correctly handles FIELD_NAMEs, but when it's END_OBJECT, it stops.\n\nWait, but in the loop, for each FIELD_NAME, it's processing the field and its value. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that after the loop, the tokens buffer is written with writeEndObject(), but the initial writeStartObject() was already done. So the structure is correct.\n\nWait, but looking at the code, tokens.writeStartObject() is called before the loop. Then, for each field, it's writing the field name and value. After processing all fields, it writes writeEndObject(). So the tokens buffer should have the complete object structure.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last creator property is not the last field in the JSON object. So after building the bean, the remaining fields are not being correctly passed to the unwrapped property handler.\n\nWait, the processUnwrapped method is called with the tokens buffer, which should contain all the remaining fields. So if the tokens buffer is correctly built, then processUnwrapped should handle them.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p) is not correctly copying the remaining tokens. So perhaps the way the tokens are being copied is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not be using tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p), but instead, after the last creator property, it should read all the remaining tokens and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should collect all the tokens after the last creator property into the tokens buffer, including any nested structures.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of processing each field in a loop, perhaps after the last creator property, the code should read the entire remaining content (until the end of the object) and append it to the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified to, after the last creator property is processed, read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nHow can that be done? Let me think.\n\nAfter assigning the last creator property, the code gets the next token, which is either FIELD_NAME or END_OBJECT. If it's FIELD_NAME, it processes the field. But perhaps instead of processing each field individually, it's better to read all the remaining content and append it to the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should do something like this:\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned, the code should read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nIn the current code, the while loop is:\n\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken(); // to point to value\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\nThis processes each field, but perhaps it's not handling cases where the value is a nested object or array, which may have their own structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read the entire remaining structure and append it to the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be changed to:\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned, the code should read the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, instead of the while loop, perhaps the code should do:\n\n// After the last creator property is assigned\n// Read all remaining tokens until END_OBJECT\nwhile (t != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n\nWait, but the initial tokens buffer already has a writeStartObject(), so appending all the remaining tokens would include the fields and then the END_OBJECT, which might cause duplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not write the END_OBJECT in the tokens buffer, but instead, let the copyCurrentStructure handle it.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think about the structure.\n\nThe main JSON object has:\n\n{ \n  \"creatorProp1\": value,\n  \"creatorProp2\": value,\n  \"field1\": value,\n  \"field2\": value\n}\n\nWhen the last creator property is processed (say, creatorProp2), the parser is pointing to the next token after creatorProp2's value, which could be FIELD_NAME for field1 or END_OBJECT.\n\nThe current code then enters a loop where it processes each FIELD_NAME, copies the structure, and moves to the next token. So for field1, it copies the field name and value, then for field2, same. Then, when t becomes END_OBJECT, the loop stops.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where after the last creator property, there are multiple fields, and the loop is not capturing all of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but there's another issue elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not resetting the parser's state correctly after copying the tokens. Or maybe the tokens buffer is not being properly constructed.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is that the code is using p.nextToken() inside the loop, which advances the parser, but the tokens buffer is built from the parser's current state. So each copyCurrentStructure(p) is only capturing the current token and its structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should instead read all the remaining tokens and append them to the tokens buffer, without relying on the loop.\n\nSo, perhaps after the last creator property is processed, the code should read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nLet me think about how to implement that.\n\nAfter assigning the last creator property, the code does:\n\nt = p.nextToken(); // move to following FIELD_NAME/END_OBJECT\n\nThen, instead of the while loop, perhaps the code should do:\n\n// Read all remaining tokens until END_OBJECT\nwhile (t != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n\nWait, but the initial tokens buffer already has a writeStartObject(). So when we copy the remaining tokens, which include the fields and the END_OBJECT, the tokens buffer would have:\n\n{\n  ... copied fields ...\n  }\n}\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut wait, the initial code writes tokens.writeStartObject() before the loop. Then, in the loop, it copies each field's structure. Then, after the loop, it writes tokens.writeEndObject(). So the structure is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last token after the last creator property is END_OBJECT, meaning there are no more fields. In that case, the while loop doesn't run, and the tokens buffer is just an empty object.\n\nBut that's correct because there are no fields after the last creator property.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Maybe the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the unwrapped fields are not just simple key-value pairs but have more complex structures, like nested objects or arrays.\n\nWait, the current code uses tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p), which should handle nested structures because it copies the entire structure starting from the current token.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is not in the way the tokens are being copied, but in how the processUnwrapped method is handling the tokens buffer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly resetting the parser's state after building the bean, leading to the loss of data.\n\nWait, another possibility: when the code calls p.setCurrentValue(bean), perhaps it's affecting the parser's state, causing the tokens buffer to miss some data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not be using the same parser (p) after building the bean, as it may have advanced the parser's position beyond the current object.\n\nWait, the code after building the bean does:\n\np.setCurrentValue(bean);\n\nThen, it processes the remaining tokens and appends them to the tokens buffer. But perhaps the parser's position is not correctly set, leading to missing data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should create a new parser for the tokens buffer instead of modifying the existing one.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that after building the bean, the parser's current position is after the last creator property, and the code is trying to read the remaining tokens, but the way it's done is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not be using the same parser (p) to read the remaining tokens because after building the bean, the parser's state is advanced beyond the object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should create a new parser from the tokens buffer to process the unwrapped fields.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the overall flow.\n\nThe method is trying to deserialize a JSON object where some properties are used as creator properties to build the bean, and the remaining properties are unwrapped and set after the bean is created.\n\nSo, the code first reads the creator properties, builds the bean, then reads the remaining properties and passes them to the unwrapped property handler.\n\nThe issue is that the remaining properties are not being correctly captured in the tokens buffer, leading to data loss.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that all the remaining tokens after the last creator property are correctly copied into the tokens buffer.\n\nIn the original code, after the last creator property is processed, the code reads the next token (t) and enters a loop that processes each FIELD_NAME, copying the structure into the tokens buffer.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is missing some tokens, especially if the remaining structure is complex.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to change the way the remaining tokens are copied. Instead of processing each FIELD_NAME individually, the code should read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, modifying the code after the last creator property is assigned:\n\nt = p.nextToken();\nwhile (t != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n\nWait, but the initial code already writes the end object after the loop. So perhaps the code should not write the end object again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should let the copyCurrentStructure handle the end object.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because the tokens buffer is being written with writeStartObject(), and then the loop appends the fields, and finally writeEndObject(). But if the remaining tokens include the END_OBJECT, then the tokens buffer would have an extra END_OBJECT, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to read all the tokens after the last creator property, excluding the END_OBJECT, and then write the END_OBJECT in the tokens buffer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not write the END_OBJECT in the tokens buffer because the copyCurrentStructure would include it.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be restructured as follows:\n\nAfter the last creator property is processed, read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object, and append them to the tokens buffer. Then, do not write the END_OBJECT because the copyCurrentStructure would have included it.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about how TokenBuffer works.\n\nTokenBuffer is used to collect tokens into a buffer so that they can be parsed later. The writeStartObject() and writeEndObject() are used to wrap the tokens appropriately.\n\nIn the original code, the tokens buffer starts with writeStartObject(). Then, for each field, it copies the structure, which includes the field name and value. After all fields are processed, it writes writeEndObject().\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining tokens include nested objects or arrays, which require the buffer to correctly represent their structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not be using a loop and instead should read all the remaining tokens at once.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the while loop with code that reads all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and appends them to the tokens buffer.\n\nLet me try to modify the code accordingly.\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned, the code does:\n\nt = p.nextToken();\n\nThen, instead of the while loop, we can do:\n\n// Read all remaining tokens until END_OBJECT\nwhile (t != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\n// Now, write the end object\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n\nWait, but this would cause the tokens buffer to have the start object, followed by all the copied structures, and then an end object. But the copied structures may already include the end object, leading to duplication.\n\nHmm, perhaps that's the issue. So, perhaps the code should not write the end object again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read all the tokens until the end object, and then let the tokens buffer handle the structure without adding an extra end object.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial writeStartObject() is unnecessary because the copied structures already include the necessary tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not writeStartObject() at the beginning, but instead, let the copied structures form the entire object.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the tokens buffer needs to represent the remaining fields as part of an object.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to have the tokens buffer start with a start object, then append all the remaining fields, and then end the object.\n\nBut in the original code, the loop appends each field's structure, and then after the loop, it writes the end object. So that should be correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last token after the last creator property is END_OBJECT, meaning no fields are left. In that case, the tokens buffer would have a start and end object with nothing in between, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the issue is that the tokens buffer is not correctly handling the unwrapped fields after the last creator property. So perhaps the code is missing some fields.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is using p.nextToken() inside the loop, which advances the parser, but the tokens buffer is built from the parser's current state. So each copyCurrentStructure(p) is only capturing the current token and its structure, but not the entire remaining content.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should instead read all the remaining tokens and append them to the tokens buffer in one go, without processing each field individually.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified to:\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned, read all the remaining tokens until the end of the object and append them to the tokens buffer.\n\nHow can this be done? Let me think.\n\nThe code can read the entire remaining content as a sub-tree and append it to the tokens buffer.\n\nIn Jackson, the JsonParser has a method called skipSubTree() which can be used to read all the tokens under the current position. Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the TokenBuffer to append all the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can create a new TokenBuffer that captures all the remaining tokens after the last creator property.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned:\n\n// Read all remaining tokens into a new TokenBuffer\nTokenBuffer remainingTokens = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\nremainingTokens.writeStartObject();\nwhile (t != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n    remainingTokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\nremainingTokens.writeEndObject();\n\n// Then, append the remainingTokens to the original tokens buffer\ntokens.append(remainingTokens);\n\nWait, but that might not be the correct approach because the original tokens buffer already has a writeStartObject(). So appending another object would create a nested structure, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not writeStartObject() in the original tokens buffer, but instead, let the remainingTokens handle the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to have the tokens buffer collect all the remaining fields without wrapping them in another object, but that might not be correct because the unwrapped properties are part of the same object.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the original code again.\n\nThe original code starts the tokens buffer with writeStartObject(). Then, for each remaining field, it writes the field name and copies the structure. Finally, it writes writeEndObject(). So the tokens buffer should have the correct structure.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields are not just simple key-value pairs but have nested objects or arrays.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is using tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p) which only copies the current structure, but not all the nested tokens.\n\nWait, no, the copyCurrentStructure method should recursively copy all the tokens under the current position, including nested objects and arrays.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last creator property is followed by multiple fields, and the loop is not capturing all of them.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should not be using a while loop that depends on t being FIELD_NAME, but instead, it should read all tokens until END_OBJECT, regardless of their type.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified to:\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned:\n\nt = p.nextToken();\nwhile (t != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n\ntokens.writeEndObject();\n\nThis way, all tokens until the end of the object are copied, including any FIELD_NAMEs and their values, as well as any other tokens that might be present (though in a valid JSON object, after the last FIELD_NAME, the next token should be END_OBJECT).\n\nWait, but in the original code, the loop only processes FIELD_NAME tokens. So if there are any other tokens (like values) after the last FIELD_NAME, they would not be processed. But in a valid JSON object, after the last FIELD_NAME, the next token should be the value, followed by END_OBJECT.\n\nSo, perhaps the original code's loop is correct because it processes each FIELD_NAME and its corresponding value.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last creator property is followed by a FIELD_NAME, but the value is a complex structure that spans multiple tokens (like an array or object). In that case, the copyCurrentStructure should handle it, but perhaps it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not be using a loop and instead should read all the remaining tokens at once.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the code should not process each field individually, but instead, after the last creator property, read the entire remaining content as a sub-tree and append it to the tokens buffer.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter the last creator property is assigned:\n\n// Read all remaining tokens until END_OBJECT\nTokenBuffer remaining = new TokenBuffer(p, ctxt);\nremaining.writeStartObject();\nwhile",
      "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the deserializeUsingPropertyBasedWithUnwrapped method. The root cause is that the TokenBuffer isn't correctly handling the unwrapped fields after the last creator property. The problem is that when using tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p), it doesn't copy all the remaining tokens properly, leading to data loss.\n\nThe suggestion is to switch to a different deserialization approach, possibly using JsonParser instead of TokenBuffer. So, I should rewrite the deserialization logic to handle the unwrapped fields correctly.\n\nLet me look at the original code. The method uses a TokenBuffer to collect the remaining fields after the creator properties. But when the last creator property is processed, it tries to copy the remaining tokens, which isn't working as intended.\n\nI think the issue is that after the creator properties are processed, the code tries to read the remaining fields and add them to the TokenBuffer.

So, perhaps I can collect all the remaining tokens into a separate JsonParser and then process that.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the current approach doesn't correctly handle nested objects or arrays in the unwrapped fields. So, using a different method that can correctly parse these structures would fix the problem.\n\nSo, perhaps I should modify the code to, after building the bean, read the remaining content into a new JsonParser and then pass that to the unwrapped property handler.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When the last creator property is assigned, instead of trying to copy the remaining tokens into TokenBuffer, read the remaining JSON structure as a whole.\n\n2. Use a new JsonParser to parse the remaining content, which can correctly handle unwrapped fields, including nested objects and arrays.\n\n3. Pass this new parser to the _unwrappedPropertyHandler along with the bean.\n\nSo, in the code, after building the bean, instead of using tokens, I can create a new TokenBuffer that captures the remaining content correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the current code doesn't reset the parser correctly after the last creator property. So, when it tries to read the remaining fields, it's missing some.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should not use TokenBuffer at all for the unwrapped part. Instead, after building the bean, the remaining JSON should be read as a tree and passed to the handler.\n\nBut changing to a tree model might be a bigger change. Alternatively, perhaps the way the tokens are copied is incorrect. Maybe the loop should continue until the end of the object, not just field names.\n\nWait, in the original code, after the last creator property is assigned, it enters a loop that continues as long as t is FIELD_NAME. For each, it advances the parser, copies the structure, and moves to the next token. This should capture all remaining fields. But perhaps the way it's done is not handling the end object correctly.\n\nWait, the loop is while (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME). So, when t becomes END_OBJECT, the loop exits. But what about the case where after the last FIELD_NAME, the next token is END_OBJECT? The code writes the end object in tokens, but perhaps the structure isn't correctly formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tokens are not being properly reset or started before copying.\n\nWait, in the original code, tokens.writeStartObject() is called before the loop. Then, for each field, it writes the field name and copies the structure. Finally, tokens.writeEndObject() is called. But perhaps the initial writeStartObject() is causing issues because the actual JSON might not start with an object.\n\nWait, no, because the method is called in the context of an object, so the structure should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is using p.nextToken() in a way that skips some tokens, leading to missing data in the TokenBuffer.\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is that after the last creator property is processed, the code is not correctly handling the remaining structure, especially if there are nested objects or arrays.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to change how the remaining tokens are captured. Instead of manually copying each field, maybe we should let the TokenBuffer capture the entire remaining structure.\n\nWait, another approach: after building the bean, instead of using the existing tokens, create a new TokenBuffer that starts from the current position of p. Then, read until the end of the object and pass that buffer to the handler.\n\nSo, in the code, after bean = creator.build(...), instead of using the existing tokens, create a new TokenBuffer that captures from p's current position to the end of the object.\n\nBut how to do that? Because p is a JsonParser, which is a stream, so once you read past a point, you can't go back. So, perhaps after the last creator property is processed, the code should read all the remaining tokens into a new TokenBuffer.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after the last creator property, the code is already trying to read the remaining fields. So, perhaps the problem is that the way it's done is not capturing all the necessary tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not use TokenBuffer at all for the unwrapped fields. Instead, after building the bean, the remaining JSON should be parsed as a separate structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the current code is trying to handle the unwrapped fields by copying tokens, but it's not correctly handling cases where the unwrapped fields contain nested objects or arrays. So, using a different approach, like using the JsonParser to read the remaining content as a tree, would be better.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to, after building the bean, read the remaining JSON as a JsonNode and pass that to the unwrapped property handler.\n\nBut that would require changing the method's approach, which might be more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where after the last creator property, there are more fields that are not just simple key-value pairs but have deeper structures.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to, after the last creator property, read the entire remaining content into a TokenBuffer correctly.\n\nWait, in the original code, after the last creator property is assigned, the code does:\n\nt = p.nextToken(); // move to following FIELD_NAME/END_OBJECT\n\nThen, in a while loop, it copies each field. But perhaps this misses the case where after the last FIELD_NAME, the next token is END_OBJECT, which is not being copied.\n\nWait, no, because the loop runs while t is FIELD_NAME. So, when t becomes END_OBJECT, the loop exits. Then, tokens.writeEndObject() is called. So, the tokens should have all the fields up to END_OBJECT.\n\nBut perhaps the initial writeStartObject() is causing the structure to be incorrect. For example, if the remaining JSON is not an object, but the code assumes it is.\n\nWait, no, because the method is called in the context of an object, so the structure should be an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields include other objects or arrays, leading to incomplete deserialization.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the current approach using TokenBuffer is not sufficient, and a different method is needed to correctly capture the remaining structure.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the TokenBuffer approach with a different method, such as using a JsonParser to read the remaining content and pass it to the handler.\n\nIn that case, after building the bean, instead of using tokens, I can read the remaining content into a new JsonParser and pass that to _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped.\n\nBut how to get the remaining content as a new parser? One way is to create a new TokenBuffer that captures from the current position to the end of the object, then create a parser from that buffer.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be modified as follows:\n\nAfter building the bean, create a new TokenBuffer, read all remaining tokens into it until the end of the object, then create a parser from this buffer and pass it to the handler.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after the last creator property, the code is already trying to read the remaining fields. So, perhaps the problem is that the way it's done is not capturing all the tokens correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not use TokenBuffer at all and instead read the remaining JSON as a tree.\n\nBut that would require changing the method's structure more significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields are not just simple key-value pairs but have deeper structures, leading to the TokenBuffer not capturing the entire subtree.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to, after the last creator property, read the entire remaining content into a TokenBuffer correctly, ensuring that all nested structures are included.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is using p.nextToken() in a way that advances the parser beyond the current field, causing some tokens to be skipped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use a different approach to copy the remaining structure.\n\nWait, another idea: instead of manually looping through each field and copying, perhaps we can use the TokenBuffer's copyCurrentStructure method in a way that captures the entire remaining object.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial tokens.writeStartObject() is causing the structure to be incorrect because the remaining JSON is not an object. But that can't be the case because the method is called within an object context.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields are empty, leading to an extra empty object being written.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly resetting the TokenBuffer after the initial writeStartObject(), leading to incorrect structures.\n\nWait, perhaps the fix is to not use TokenBuffer for the unwrapped fields and instead read the remaining JSON directly into a new parser.\n\nSo, after building the bean, instead of using the existing tokens, create a new TokenBuffer that captures the remaining content correctly.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nIn the original code, after building the bean, the code uses the existing tokens. But perhaps the tokens are not correctly capturing all the remaining fields.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to, after building the bean, create a new TokenBuffer that starts from the current position of p, reads until the end of the object, and then uses that buffer.\n\nBut how to do that? Because once you've read past certain tokens, you can't go back.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be restructured to collect all the tokens into the buffer first, before processing the creator properties. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not process the creator properties and buffer the rest at the same time. Instead, first collect all the fields, separate the creator properties, and then handle the rest.\n\nBut that would require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is using p.nextToken() in a way that skips some tokens, leading to missing data in the TokenBuffer.\n\nWait, in the loop after the last creator property, the code does:\n\np.nextToken(); // to move to following FIELD_NAME/END_OBJECT\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    p.nextToken(); // move to value\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n    t = p.nextToken(); // move to next FIELD_NAME or END_OBJECT\n}\n\nSo, for each field, it moves to the value, copies the structure, and then moves to the next token. But perhaps this is not correctly handling nested structures because copyCurrentStructure(p) might not capture the entire subtree.\n\nWait, the TokenBuffer's copyCurrentStructure method is supposed to copy the current structure starting from the current token. So, for example, if the current token is a FIELD_NAME, it copies the entire field, including its value, which could be an object or array.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is correct in that aspect. But maybe the initial writeStartObject() is causing an issue because the remaining structure is not an object.\n\nWait, no, because the method is called within an object, so the remaining structure should be fields within that object.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields are not just at the top level but are nested within other structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the last token is END_OBJECT, leading to an incomplete buffer.\n\nWait, in the original code, after the loop, it writes tokens.writeEndObject(). So, if the loop captured all the fields, this should correctly close the object.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the initial tokens.writeStartObject() is causing the buffer to have an extra start object, leading to invalid JSON when processed.\n\nWait, no, because the buffer is supposed to represent the remaining part of the object, so starting with an object is correct.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for alternative approaches.\n\nThe suggestion was to use a different deserialization approach, such as using JsonParser instead of TokenBuffer. So, perhaps the fix is to avoid using TokenBuffer for the unwrapped fields and instead read the remaining JSON directly.\n\nSo, after building the bean, instead of using the TokenBuffer, I can read the remaining content as a JsonParser and pass it to the unwrapped property handler.\n\nBut how to get the remaining content as a parser? One way is to create a new TokenBuffer that captures from the current position of p to the end of the object, then create a parser from that buffer.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter building the bean, create a new TokenBuffer, read all the remaining tokens into it, then create a JsonParser from this buffer, and pass it to the handler.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after the last creator property, the code is already trying to read the remaining fields and add them to the tokens buffer. So, perhaps the problem is that this approach is not correctly capturing all the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not process the remaining fields in the loop and instead let the TokenBuffer capture the entire remaining structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should be restructured to collect all the tokens first, then process the creator properties, and then handle the remaining fields.\n\nBut that might require a significant rewrite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields include other objects or arrays, leading to the TokenBuffer not capturing the entire structure.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to change how the remaining tokens are copied into the buffer. Instead of looping through each field, perhaps we can use a different method to copy the entire remaining structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be modified to, after the last creator property, read the entire remaining content into the TokenBuffer using a different approach.\n\nFor example, after building the bean, instead of the while loop, we can do:\n\ntokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would capture the entire remaining structure correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should not use TokenBuffer at all and instead read the remaining content as a tree.\n\nBut that would require changing the method's structure more significantly.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the current code is not correctly handling the case where the remaining fields are not just top-level fields but include nested objects or arrays. So, the TokenBuffer approach is not sufficient, and a different method is needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to switch to using a different deserialization approach, such as using a JsonParser to read the remaining content as a tree and then passing that to the handler.\n\nBut how to implement that within the existing code.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be modified to, after building the bean, read the remaining JSON as a JsonNode and pass that to the unwrapped property handler.\n\nSo, instead of using TokenBuffer, after building the bean, the code can read the remaining content into a JsonNode and then pass that node to the handler.\n\nBut that would require changing the method's logic, as the handler expects a JsonParser.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can read the remaining content into a new TokenBuffer, then create a JsonParser from that buffer, and pass it to the handler.\n\nSo, in the code, after building the bean, instead of using the existing tokens, create a new TokenBuffer, read all the remaining tokens into it, then create a parser from that buffer.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nAfter building the bean, create a new TokenBuffer, then read all the remaining tokens into it until the end of the object.
