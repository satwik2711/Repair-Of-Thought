      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `processOptionToken` method is not correctly handling unrecognized options when `stopAtNonOption` is set to `false`. In this case, the method should throw an `UnrecognizedOptionException` when it encounters an unrecognized option. However, the current implementation only checks if the option exists and if `stopAtNonOption` is set, but it does not throw an exception when an unrecognized option is encountered.\nSuggestion: Throw UnrecognizedOptionException when option does not exist\nThe `processOptionToken` method should be modified to throw an `UnrecognizedOptionException` when the option does not exist and `stopAtNonOption` is set to `false`. This can be achieved by adding an else clause to the if statement that checks if the option exists.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate void processOptionToken(String token, boolean stopAtNonOption)\n{\n    if (options.hasOption(token))\n    {\n        currentOption = options.getOption(token);\n        tokens.add(token);\n    }\n    else if (stopAtNonOption)\n    {\n        eatTheRest = true;\n        tokens.add(token);\n    }\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
