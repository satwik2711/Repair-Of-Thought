      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `readEscape` function does not correctly handle the escape sequence for the character 'a'. The function does not have a specific case for 'a' in the switch statement, and the default case simply returns the character 'a' without any modification. This results in the escape sequence being lost, and the character 'a' being treated as a literal character.\nSuggestion: Add a Specific Case for 'a'\nAdd a new case to the switch statement to handle the character 'a'. This case should return the ASCII value of the character 'a' (which is 7). This will ensure that the escape sequence for 'a' is correctly handled.\n// Buggy Function\nint readEscape() throws IOException {\n    // the escape char has just been read (normally a backslash)\n    final int c = in.read();\n    switch (c) {\n    case 'r':\n        return CR;\n    case 'n':\n        return LF;\n    case 't':\n        return TAB;\n    case 'b':\n        return BACKSPACE;\n    case 'f':\n        return FF;\n    case CR:\n    case LF:\n    case FF: // TODO is this correct?\n    case TAB: // TODO is this correct?

This would allow for more flexibility and easier maintenance of the function. The lookup table could be a simple array or a HashMap, where the key is the character and the value is the corresponding escape sequence.\n// Buggy Function\nint readEscape() throws IOException {\n    // the escape char has just been read (normally a backslash)\n    final int c = in.read();\n    switch (c) {\n    case 'r':\n        return CR;\n    case 'n':\n        return LF;\n    case 't':\n        return TAB;\n    case 'b':\n        return BACKSPACE;\n    case 'f':\n        return FF;\n    case CR:\n    case LF:\n    case FF: // TODO is this correct?\n    case TAB: // TODO is this correct?

This would prevent the function from silently ignoring unknown characters and would provide a clear indication of an error.
