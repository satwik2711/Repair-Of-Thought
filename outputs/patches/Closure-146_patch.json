      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function getTypesUnderInequality is not correctly handling the case when the types are VOID_TYPE. Specifically, when the types are VOID_TYPE, the function is returning a TypePair with both components as null, but the expected behavior is to return a TypePair with the restricted type of 'this' and 'that' as the first and second components respectively.\nSuggestion: Handle VOID_TYPE as a Special Case\nOne possible fix is to add a special case to handle VOID_TYPE. We can add a check at the beginning of the function to see if 'this' or 'that' is VOID_TYPE, and if so, return a TypePair with the restricted type of 'this' and 'that' as the first and second components respectively. This approach is simple and easy to implement, and it correctly handles the case when the types are VOID_TYPE.\n// Buggy Function\npublic TypePair getTypesUnderInequality(JSType that) {\n  // unions types\n  if (that instanceof UnionType) {\n    TypePair p = that.getTypesUnderInequality(this);\n    return new TypePair(p.typeB, p.typeA);\n  }\n\n  // other types\n  switch (this.testForEquality(that)) {\n    case TRUE:\n      return new TypePair(null, null);\n\n    case FALSE:\n    case UNKNOWN:\n      return new TypePair(this, that);\n  }\n\n  // switch case is exhaustive\n  throw new IllegalStateException();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Specifically, when the types are VOID_TYPE, the function is returning a TypePair with both components as null, but the expected behavior is to return a TypePair with the restricted type of 'this' and 'that' as the first and second components respectively.\nSuggestion: Modify the Switch Statement\nAnother possible fix is to modify the switch statement to handle the case when the types are VOID_TYPE. We can add a new case to the switch statement to handle this case, and return a TypePair with the restricted type of 'this' and 'that' as the first and second components respectively. This approach requires modifying the existing switch statement, but it provides a more comprehensive solution.\n// Buggy Function\npublic TypePair getTypesUnderInequality(JSType that) {\n  // unions types\n  if (that instanceof UnionType) {\n    TypePair p = that.getTypesUnderInequality(this);\n    return new TypePair(p.typeB, p.typeA);\n  }\n\n  // other types\n  switch (this.testForEquality(that)) {\n    case TRUE:\n      return new TypePair(null, null);\n\n    case FALSE:\n    case UNKNOWN:\n      return new TypePair(this, that);\n  }\n\n  // switch case is exhaustive\n  throw new IllegalStateException();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

Instead of using a switch statement, we can use a series of if-else statements to handle the different cases. This approach may be more flexible and easier to maintain, as it allows us to add new cases without modifying the existing code. We can add a check for VOID_TYPE at the beginning of the function, and then use if-else statements to handle the other cases.\n// Buggy Function\npublic TypePair getTypesUnderInequality(JSType that) {\n  // unions types\n  if (that instanceof UnionType) {\n    TypePair p = that.getTypesUnderInequality(this);\n    return new TypePair(p.typeB, p.typeA);\n  }\n\n  // other types\n  switch (this.testForEquality(that)) {\n    case TRUE:\n      return new TypePair(null, null);\n\n    case FALSE:\n    case UNKNOWN:\n      return new TypePair(this, that);\n  }\n\n  // switch case is exhaustive\n  throw new IllegalStateException();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
