When a cycle is detected, the function handleTypeCycle is called, but it does not prevent the cycle from causing an error. The function should be modified to prevent cycles from causing errors.\nSuggestion: Prevent Cycles from Causing Errors\nWe can modify the function resolveInternal to prevent cycles from causing errors by adding a check for cycles before calling the function handleTypeCycle. If a cycle is detected, we can return an error message instead of throwing an exception. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // ...\n  if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {\n    return errorReporter.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, but it may not be the most efficient way to handle cycles.\n// Buggy Function\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // TODO(user): Investigate whether it is really necessary to keep two\n  // different mechanisms for resolving named types, and if so, which order\n  // makes more sense.

When a cycle is detected, the function handleTypeCycle is called, but it does not prevent the cycle from causing an error. The function should be modified to prevent cycles from causing errors.\nSuggestion: Use a Different Mechanism for Resolving Named Types\nWe can modify the function resolveInternal to use a different mechanism for resolving named types, such as using a graph to keep track of the inheritance chain. This would allow us to detect cycles more efficiently and prevent them from causing errors. Here is an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // Create a graph to keep track of the inheritance chain\n  Graph<JSType> graph = new Graph<>();\n  // ...\n  if (graph.hasCycle()) {\n    return errorReporter.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is more complex, but it may be more efficient and scalable.\n// Buggy Function\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // TODO(user): Investigate whether it is really necessary to keep two\n  // different mechanisms for resolving named types, and if so, which order\n  // makes more sense.
