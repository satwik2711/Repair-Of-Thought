      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `Calendar` object is not being set to the correct locale before calculating the week number. The `GregorianCalendar` object is created with the `mTimeZone` field, but it is not clear if this field is set to the correct locale. Additionally, the `Calendar` object is not being set to the correct first day of the week and minimum days in first week for the Swedish locale. In Sweden, the first day of the week is Monday and the minimum days in the first week is 4.\nSuggestion: Set Calendar to Correct Locale\nOne potential fix is to set the `Calendar` object to the correct locale before calculating the week number. This can be done by calling the `setLocale` method on the `Calendar` object before setting the time. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nCalendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\nc.setLocale(locale);\nc.setTime(date);\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\nThis fix assumes that the `locale` field is set to the correct locale for the date being formatted.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String format(Date date) {\n    Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\n    c.setTime(date);\n    return applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

Additionally, the `Calendar` object is not being set to the correct first day of the week and minimum days in first week for the Swedish locale. In Sweden, the first day of the week is Monday and the minimum days in the first week is 4.\nSuggestion: Set First Day of Week and Minimum Days in First Week\nAnother potential fix is to set the first day of the week and minimum days in the first week for the Swedish locale. This can be done by calling the `setFirstDayOfWeek` and `setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek` methods on the `Calendar` object before calculating the week number. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nCalendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\nc.setFirstDayOfWeek(Calendar.MONDAY);\nc.setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(4);\nc.setTime(date);\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\nThis fix assumes that the first day of the week is Monday and the minimum days in the first week is 4 for the Swedish locale.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String format(Date date) {\n    Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\n    c.setTime(date);\n    return applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This can be done by calling the `Calendar.getInstance` method with the correct locale. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nCalendar c = Calendar.getInstance(locale);\nc.setTime(date);\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\nThis fix assumes that the `locale` field is set to the correct locale for the date being formatted.\n// Buggy Function\npublic String format(Date date) {\n    Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\n    c.setTime(date);\n    return applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
