      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The issue arises from the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method, which checks if a given node is a function expression using `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n)`. However, this method does not account for cases where a function expression is used as a getter in an object literal. The error occurs because the `AstValidator` expects a function expression in certain contexts but encounters a call reference node instead, likely due to how getter properties are handled. This mismatch between the expected and actual node types leads to an `IllegalStateException`.\nSuggestion: Modify the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` Method to Check for Getters\nModify the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method to include an additional check for cases where the function expression is used as a getter in an object literal. This could involve examining the node's parent to determine if it is part of an object literal and if the function expression is being used as a getter. By adding this check, the method can more accurately identify function expressions that are used in this specific context, potentially resolving the `IllegalStateException` by ensuring that the `AstValidator` receives the correct type of node.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This mismatch between the expected and actual node types leads to an `IllegalStateException`.\nSuggestion: Adjust the `AstValidator` to Handle Getters Correctly\nAnother approach to resolving this issue involves modifying the `AstValidator` itself to correctly handle function expressions that are used as getters in object literals. This could involve updating the validation rules within the `AstValidator` to account for this specific use case, ensuring that when it encounters a function expression used as a getter, it correctly identifies and processes it. This adjustment would prevent the `IllegalStateException` by aligning the `AstValidator's` expectations with the actual node types it encounters.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This mismatch between the expected and actual node types leads to an `IllegalStateException`.\nSuggestion: Introduce a New Method for Checking Function Expressions in Getters\nA more comprehensive solution might involve introducing a new method that is specifically designed to check for function expressions used as getters in object literals. This new method could be used in conjunction with the existing `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method to provide a more nuanced and accurate assessment of the node types. By having a dedicated method for this specific case, the code can better handle the complexities of function expressions used in getter properties, thereby preventing the `IllegalStateException` and ensuring that the code behaves as expected.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function",

This could involve modifying the method to check not just if a node is a function expression, but also if it is being used in a context that requires additional handling, such as within an object literal as a getter. By enhancing this method, the code can more effectively identify and handle function expressions in various contexts, reducing the likelihood of errors like the `IllegalStateException`.\n\nEach of these suggestions offers a distinct approach to addressing the root cause of the issue, providing options for how to modify the existing code to better handle function expressions used as getters in object literals.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function"
