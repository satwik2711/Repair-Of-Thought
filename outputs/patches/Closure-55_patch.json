      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` function is not correctly checking if a node is a function expression. The function is currently using the `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression` method, which is not sufficient to handle the case where the node is a getter method. The `AstValidator` is expecting a function node, but it's actually getting a call reference node, which is causing the error.\nSuggestion: Check for Call Reference Node\nWe can modify the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` function to check if the node is a call reference node and if its parent is a function expression. If it is, then we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```java\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    if (n instanceof CallReferenceNode && n.getParent() instanceof FunctionExpressionNode) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and efficient, but it may not cover all cases where the node is a getter method.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

The `AstValidator` is expecting a function node, but it's actually getting a call reference node, which is causing the error.\nSuggestion: Check for Getter Method\nAnother possible solution is to check if the node is a getter method. We can do this by checking if the node is a property node and if its key is a string that starts with 'get'. If it is, then we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```java\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    if (n instanceof PropertyNode && n.getKey().startsWith(\"get\")) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n```\nThis solution is more specific to the case where the node is a getter method, but it may not cover all cases where the node is a call reference node.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

The `AstValidator` is expecting a function node, but it's actually getting a call reference node, which is causing the error.\nSuggestion: Combine Both Checks\nWe can also combine both checks to make the function more robust. We can check if the node is a call reference node and if its parent is a function expression, and also check if the node is a getter method. If either of these conditions is true, then we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```java\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    if ((n instanceof CallReferenceNode && n.getParent() instanceof FunctionExpressionNode) || (n instanceof PropertyNode && n.getKey().startsWith(\"get\"))) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n```\nThis solution is the most comprehensive and should cover all cases where the node is a function expression or a getter method.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n  return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
