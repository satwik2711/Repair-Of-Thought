      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `add(String newcode)` does not correctly handle the case where the new code starts with a forward slash and the last character of the existing code is a division operator. In this case, the function should not append a space before appending the new code, but it does. This is because the function checks if the last character of the existing code is a word character, but it does not check if it is a division operator.\nSuggestion: Check for Division Operator Before Appending Space\nCheck if the last character of the existing code is a division operator before appending a space. If it is, do not append a space. This can be achieved by adding a simple condition to the existing if statement.\n\n```java\nvoid add(String newcode) {\n  maybeEndStatement();\n\n  if (newcode.length() == 0) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  char c = newcode.charAt(0);\n  if ((isWordChar(c) || c == '\\\\') &&\n      isWordChar(getLastChar()) && getLastChar() != '/') {\n    // need space to separate. This is not pretty printing.\n    // For example: \"return foo;\"\n    append(\" \");\n  }\n\n  append(newcode);\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\nvoid add(String newcode) {\n  maybeEndStatement();\n\n  if (newcode.length() == 0) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  char c = newcode.charAt(0);\n  if ((isWordChar(c) || c == '\\\\') &&\n      isWordChar(getLastChar())) {\n    // need space to separate. This is not pretty printing.\n    // For example: \"return foo;\"\n    append(\" \");\n    // Do not allow a forward slash to appear after a DIV.\n    // For example,\n    // REGEXP DIV REGEXP\n    // is valid and should print like\n    // / // / /\n  }\n\n  append(newcode);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This is because the function checks if the last character of the existing code is a word character, but it does not check if it is a division operator.\nSuggestion: Use a More Specific Check for Word Characters\nInstead of checking if the last character of the existing code is a word character, check if it is a letter or an underscore.
