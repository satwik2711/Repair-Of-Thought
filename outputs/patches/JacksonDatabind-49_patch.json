      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The `generateId` function is not correctly handling the ID generation for objects that are referenced multiple times in the object graph. In this case, the `Bar` object is referenced twice in the `Foo` object, and the `generateId` function is not correctly handling this scenario, leading to an unresolved forward reference during deserialization.\nSuggestion: Use a Map to Store Generated IDs\nWe can modify the `generateId` function to use a map to store the generated IDs for each object. This way, if an object is referenced multiple times, we can simply return the already generated ID instead of generating a new one. This approach ensures that each object has a unique ID and avoids the unresolved forward reference issue.\n\n```java\nprivate Map<Object, Object> idMap = new HashMap<>();\n\npublic Object generateId(Object forPojo) {\n    if (idMap.containsKey(forPojo)) {\n        return idMap.get(forPojo);\n    }\n    Object id = generator.generateId(forPojo);\n    idMap.put(forPojo, id);\n    return id;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object generateId(Object forPojo) {\n    // 04-Jun-2016, tatu: As per [databind#1255], need to consider possibility of\n    //    id being generated for \"alwaysAsId\", but not being written as POJO; regardless,\n    //    need to use existing id if there is one:\n        id = generator.generateId(forPojo);\n    return id;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

If an ID already exists, we can simply return it instead of generating a new one. This approach ensures that each object has a unique ID and avoids the unresolved forward reference issue.\n\n```java\npublic Object generateId(Object forPojo) {\n    Object existingId = generator.findExistingId(forPojo);\n    if (existingId != null) {\n        return existingId;\n    }\n    Object id = generator.generateId(forPojo);\n    return id;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic Object generateId(Object forPojo) {\n    // 04-Jun-2016, tatu: As per [databind#1255], need to consider possibility of\n    //    id being generated for \"alwaysAsId\", but not being written as POJO; regardless,\n    //    need to use existing id if there is one:\n        id = generator.generateId(forPojo);\n    return id;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
