The function is calling the super.equals(obj) method, which is not overridden in the ShapeList class.

This is why the equals function is returning false when comparing the original object with the deserialized object, even though they have the same content.\nSuggestion: Implementing equals function based on content\nWe can implement the equals function based on the content of the ShapeList objects.
