      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `toUpperCase()` method is not locale-independent. It converts characters to uppercase based on the default locale, which can lead to incorrect results when dealing with locale-specific characters. In this case, the character '\\\\u00df' is being converted to 'SS' when the locale is set to English, but it should be converted to '\\u00df' when the locale is set to German. This is causing the `containsIgnoreCase` function to return incorrect results.\nSuggestion: Use Locale-Independent Case Conversion\nUse the `String.equalsIgnoreCase()` method instead of `toUpperCase()` to compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner. This method is locale-independent and will correctly handle locale-specific characters.\n// Buggy Function\npublic static boolean containsIgnoreCase(String str, String searchStr) {\n    if (str == null || searchStr == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return contains(str.toUpperCase(), searchStr.toUpperCase());\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",
