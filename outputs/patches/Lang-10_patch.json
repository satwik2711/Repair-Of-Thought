      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of whitespace characters in the `escapeRegex` function. When a whitespace character is encountered, the function appends `\\\\\\\\s*+` to the regex, which matches zero or more whitespace characters. However, this can lead to incorrect parsing of dates when the input string contains multiple whitespace characters. The `+` quantifier is possessive, which means that it will match as many characters as possible, including the subsequent whitespace characters. This can cause the regular expression to match incorrectly, leading to the unexpected parsing of dates.\nSuggestion: Remove Possessive Quantifier\nOne possible fix is to remove the possessive quantifier `+` from the `\\\\\\\\s*+` pattern. This will allow the regular expression to match zero or more whitespace characters, but will not make the match possessive. This can be achieved by changing the line `regex.append(\"\\\\\\\\s*+\");` to `regex.append(\"\\\\\\\\s*\");`. This fix will correctly handle whitespace characters and prevent the unexpected parsing of dates.\n// Buggy Function\nprivate static StringBuilder escapeRegex(StringBuilder regex, String value, boolean unquote) {\n    boolean wasWhite= false;\n    for(int i= 0; i<value.length(); ++i) {\n        char c= value.charAt(i);\n        if(Character.isWhitespace(c)) {\n            if(!wasWhite) {\n                wasWhite= true;\n                regex.append(\"\\\\s*+\");\n            }\n            continue;\n        }\n        wasWhite= false;\n        switch(c) {\n        case '\\'':\n            if(unquote) {\n                if(++i==value.length()) {\n                    return regex;\n                }\n                c= value.charAt(i);\n            }\n            break;\n        case '?':\n        case '[':\n        case ']':\n        case '(':\n        case ')':\n        case '{':\n        case '}':\n        case '\\\\':\n        case '|':\n        case '*':\n        case '+':\n        case '^':\n        case '$':\n        case '.':\n            regex.append('\\\\');\n        }\n        regex.append(c);\n    }\n    return regex;\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.

This can be achieved by changing the line `regex.append(\"\\\\\\\\s*+\");` to `regex.append(\"\\\\\\\\s*?\");`. The `?` quantifier makes the match non-possessive, which means that it will match as few characters as possible.
