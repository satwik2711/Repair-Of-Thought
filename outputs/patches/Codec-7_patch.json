      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `encodeBase64` function is appending a newline character to the output when the `isChunked` parameter is set to `true`. This is because the `encodeBase64` function is designed to encode binary data into 76 character blocks separated by CRLF. However, in this case, the input is a single character 'f', which results in a base64 encoded string 'Zg==' that is less than 76 characters. As a result, the function is appending a newline character to the output, causing the test to fail.\nSuggestion: Remove Newline Character\nOne possible fix is to remove the newline character from the output of the `encodeBase64` function when the input is a single character. This can be done by modifying the `encodeBase64String` function to check if the input is a single character and if so, remove the newline character from the output. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static String encodeBase64String(byte[] binaryData) {\n    String encodedString = StringUtils.newStringUtf8(encodeBase64(binaryData, true));\n    if (binaryData.length == 1) {\n        encodedString = encodedString.replace(\"\\n\", \"\");\n    }\n    return encodedString;\n}\n```\n// Buggy Function\npublic static String encodeBase64String(byte[] binaryData) {\n    return StringUtils.newStringUtf8(encodeBase64(binaryData, true));\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1. Carefully analyze the provided root cause and fix suggestion.\n2. Ensure your implementation completely resolves the identified issue.\n3. Maintain the original method signature.\n4. Preserve the original functionality and coding style as much as possible.\n5. Incorporate all working parts of the original implementation.\n6. Follow the provided fix suggestion without over-engineering or introducing unnecessary changes.\n\n@@ Response Format\nReturn ONLY the complete fixed function wrapped in ```java\n<your implementation>\n``` tags.\n\n@@ Important Notes\n- Do not add unnecessary optimizations.\n- Do not modify the method signature.\n- Maintain the original variable names and overall coding style wherever possible.",

This can be done by adding a check in the `encodeBase64` function to see if the input is a single character and if so, not append a newline character to the output.

For example, we could use the `encodeBase64` function with the `isChunked` parameter set to `false`, which would not append a newline character to the output. However, this would change the behavior of the function and may not be desirable in all cases.
