      "You are a Senior Level Programmer with expertise in debugging and code repair. Your task is to review the provided function and produce a corrected, function-level implementation that fully addresses the identified bug.\n\n@@ Context\n// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the Base64 constructor is being called with a default value of false, which may not be the correct mode for encoding binary data. The constructor comment mentions that the encoding table is STANDARD_ENCODE_TABLE, but it does not specify the mode. The test case is expecting the encoder to work in a specific mode, but the constructor is not explicitly setting that mode. This mismatch between the expected and actual modes is likely causing the assertion failure.\nSuggestion: Explicitly Set the Encoding Mode\nThe Base64 constructor should be modified to explicitly set the encoding mode to URL_SAFE, which is the expected mode for encoding binary data. This can be done by changing the constructor to `this(true)` to enable URL-safe encoding.\n// Buggy Function\npublic Base64() {\n    this(false);\n}\n// Fixed Function\n\n@@ Instructions\n1.
