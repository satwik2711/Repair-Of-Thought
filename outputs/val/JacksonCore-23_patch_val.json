But one problem is that unless method is left abstract, sub-classing can be problematic -- if sub-class does not override method, then calls will result in an instance of wrong type being created.\nAnd this is what can easily happen with DefaultPrettyPrinter.\nA simple solution is for base class to make explicit that if base implementation is called, then instance can not be a sub-class (that is, it is only legal to call on DefaultPrettyPrinter, but no sub-class).

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** The buggy code always creates a new `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance using the `this` instance as a constructor argument, regardless of the actual class of `this`. This violates the requirement that subclasses should override `createInstance()` and that calling the base class implementation from a subclass should fail.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch checks if the current class (`getClass()`) is *not* `DefaultPrettyPrinter.class`. If it's not, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. This enforces the intended behavior: if `createInstance()` is called on a subclass without overriding, it throws an exception. If called on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself, it proceeds to create a new instance.\n- **Generated Patch:** The generated patch checks if the current class (`this.getClass()`) *is* `DefaultPrettyPrinter.class`. If it is, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. This is the opposite logic of the ground truth patch. It would throw an exception when `createInstance()` is called directly on a `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance, but *not* when called on a subclass instance.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The core behavioral difference is in when the `IllegalStateException` is thrown. The ground truth patch throws it for subclasses, as intended. The generated patch throws it for the base class itself, which is incorrect.\n- **Edge Cases:**\n    - Calling `createInstance()` on `DefaultPrettyPrinter`:\n        - Buggy Code: Works as expected, returns a `DefaultPrettyPrinter`.\n        - Ground Truth Patch: Works as expected, returns a `DefaultPrettyPrinter`.\n        - Generated Patch: Throws `IllegalStateException`, which is incorrect.\n    - Calling `createInstance()` on a subclass of `DefaultPrettyPrinter` that *does not* override `createInstance()`:\n        - Buggy Code: Incorrectly returns a `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance, not throwing an exception.\n        - Ground Truth Patch: Correctly throws `IllegalStateException`.\n        - Generated Patch: Incorrectly returns a `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance, not throwing an exception.\n    - Calling `createInstance()` on a subclass of `DefaultPrettyPrinter` that *does* override `createInstance()`:\n        - Buggy Code: Behavior depends on the subclass implementation, but the base class method is not even expected to be called in this scenario.\n        - Ground Truth Patch: Behavior depends on the subclass implementation.\n        - Generated Patch: Behavior depends on the subclass implementation.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input):** Calling `createInstance()` on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` should return a new `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance.\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `DefaultPrettyPrinter`.\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `DefaultPrettyPrinter`.\n    - Generated Patch: Throws `IllegalStateException` (incorrect).\n- **Subclass without override:** Calling `createInstance()` on a subclass instance (without override) should throw `IllegalStateException`.\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `DefaultPrettyPrinter` (incorrect).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Throws `IllegalStateException` (correct).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `DefaultPrettyPrinter` (incorrect).\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Exception Types and Messages:** Both patches use `IllegalStateException`. The ground truth message is more informative: `\"Failed \\`createInstance()\\`: \"+getClass().getName()+\" does not override method; it has to\"`. The generated patch message is `\"Subclass must override createInstance\"`. Both are reasonable, but the ground truth message is slightly better as it includes the class name.\n- **Validation Approaches:**\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Checks `getClass() != DefaultPrettyPrinter.class` to validate if the method is called on a subclass.\n    - Generated Patch: Checks `this.getClass() == DefaultPrettyPrinter.class` which is the inverse condition and incorrect for the intended bug fix.\n- **Error Handling Strategies:** Both patches use an `if` condition to check the class type and throw an exception if the condition is met. However, the conditions are opposite, leading to different error handling behaviors.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Will patch pass the trigger test?**\n    - Trigger test `testInvalidSubClass()` expects an `IllegalStateException` when calling `createInstance()` on a subclass.\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Will pass the trigger test because it throws `IllegalStateException` for subclasses.\n    - Generated Patch: Will *fail* the trigger test because it does *not* throw `IllegalStateException` for subclasses. It throws it for `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself, which is not what the test expects.\n- **Are there potential issues with other tests?** The generated patch would likely break existing tests that correctly call `createInstance()` on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself, as it would now throw an exception in that valid scenario.\n- **Could behavior changes affect dependent code?** The ground truth patch correctly enforces the intended behavior and should not negatively affect dependent code. The generated patch, however, introduces incorrect behavior by preventing `createInstance()` from working on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself, which would break existing usage.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:**  Low structural similarity (0.50) correctly indicates significant differences in the conditional logic.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Control flow similarity (1.00) is misleading in this case. While the control flow structure might be superficially similar (if-then-return), the *condition* within the `if` is inverted, leading to drastically different behavior.\n- **LLM-based validation:** LLM correctly identifies the significant difference in conditional logic and that the generated patch throws the exception in the wrong condition. The low equivalence score (0.1) and high confidence (1.0) from LLM are accurate and strongly suggest the generated patch is incorrect.\n- **Combined assessment:** The combined assessment of 0.70 confidence for semantic equivalence is misleading and should be disregarded in favor of the detailed analysis and LLM's assessment. The LLM and manual analysis clearly show the patches are *not* semantically equivalent.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as INCORRECT because it implements the opposite logic of the ground truth patch and the intended bug fix.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Incorrect Conditional Logic:** The generated patch checks `this.getClass() == DefaultPrettyPrinter.class` and throws an exception if true. This means it throws an exception when `createInstance()` is called directly on a `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance, which is the valid use case. The ground truth patch, and the issue description, require the exception to be thrown when `createInstance()` is called on a *subclass* that has not overridden the method.\n2. **Fails Trigger Test:** The trigger test `testInvalidSubClass()` is designed to catch cases where `createInstance()` is called on a subclass without overriding. The generated patch will fail this test because it does not throw an exception in this scenario. Instead, it would throw an exception in the valid scenario of calling `createInstance()` on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself.\n3. **Semantic Equivalence Test Results:** While some semantic equivalence tests might give misleading results (like control flow similarity), the LLM-based validation correctly identifies the significant difference in conditional logic and flags the patches as not equivalent.\n4. **Behavioral Differences:** The generated patch introduces incorrect behavior by breaking the valid use case of calling `createInstance()` on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` and failing to address the intended bug for subclasses.\n\nIn summary, the generated patch has fundamentally flawed logic that is opposite to the intended fix, causing it to fail the trigger test and introduce incorrect behavior. Therefore, it is classified as INCORRECT.",

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Original Buggy Code:**  Always creates a new `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance, regardless of the actual class it's called on. This violates the intended \"blueprint object\" pattern for subclasses.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Checks if the current class is exactly `DefaultPrettyPrinter.class`. If it's a subclass, it throws an `IllegalStateException`, enforcing that subclasses must override `createInstance()`. If it's `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself, it creates a new instance as before.\n- **Generated Patch:** Attempts to check if the subclass overrides the `writeObject` method using reflection. If `writeObject` is not overridden (or not found), it throws an `IllegalStateException`. It then creates a new `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance.\n- **Behavioral Differences:**\n    - **Ground Truth:** Directly checks the class type to ensure `createInstance()` is called on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` or overridden. This is a direct and targeted fix for the described issue.\n    - **Generated Patch:** Indirectly checks for method overriding by looking at `writeObject`. This is a completely different approach and the connection to the `createInstance()` issue is unclear and likely incorrect. It assumes that overriding `writeObject` is somehow related to the need to override `createInstance()`, which is not stated in the issue description or context.  It also uses a `try-catch` block for `NoSuchMethodException`, adding unnecessary complexity.\n- **Edge Cases:**\n    - **Subclass that overrides `createInstance()` but not `writeObject`:** Ground truth patch will work correctly (it will not throw exception because `createInstance` is overridden). Generated patch might incorrectly throw an exception if `writeObject` is not overridden, even though the subclass correctly handles `createInstance()`.\n    - **Subclass that overrides neither `createInstance()` nor `writeObject`:** Both patches will throw an `IllegalStateException`, but for different reasons and with different messages. Ground truth is correct and intended. Generated patch's behavior is based on an unrelated method.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input - called on `DefaultPrettyPrinter`):** Both patches return a new `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance, same as the buggy code.\n- **Subclass calling `createInstance()` (buggy scenario):**\n    - **Ground Truth:** Throws `IllegalStateException`.\n    - **Generated Patch:** Throws `IllegalStateException` if `writeObject` is not overridden.\n- **Missing/null values, Out of bounds values, Invalid inputs:** Not applicable to this method as it takes no input and operates on the object's class.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Exception Type:** Both patches use `IllegalStateException`, which is reasonable for indicating an incorrect usage pattern.\n- **Exception Message:**\n    - **Ground Truth:** \"Failed `createInstance()`: ... does not override method; it has to\". Clear and directly related to the issue.\n    - **Generated Patch:** \"Subclass does not override writeObject method\" or \"Subclass does not have writeObject method\".  Misleading and unrelated to the actual problem with `createInstance()`.\n- **Validation Approaches:**\n    - **Ground Truth:** Direct class type check. Simple and effective for the intended purpose.\n    - **Generated Patch:** Reflection-based check for `writeObject` overriding. Complex, indirect, and likely incorrect approach.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test (`testInvalidSubClass`):**\n    - **Ground Truth:** Will pass. The test expects an `IllegalStateException` when `createInstance()` is called on `MyPrettyPrinter` (a subclass), and the ground truth patch throws exactly that.\n    - **Generated Patch:** Might pass *if* `MyPrettyPrinter` does not override `writeObject`. However, the test is designed to check `createInstance()` behavior, not `writeObject`. The generated patch's success in this test is coincidental and depends on an unrelated condition. It's not guaranteed to pass if `MyPrettyPrinter` *does* override `writeObject` but not `createInstance()`.\n- **Potential issues with other tests:** The generated patch's logic is based on an assumption about `writeObject` overriding, which is not part of the intended fix. This could lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the code or fail other tests that rely on the correct behavior of `createInstance()` and subclasses.\n- **Behavior changes affect dependent code:** The generated patch introduces a completely different check than the ground truth. This change in behavior is not aligned with the intended fix and could have unintended consequences.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Low structural similarity (0.50) - confirms significant structural differences.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Control flow similarity (0.75) -  While control flow might be somewhat similar in terms of throwing exceptions, the *conditions* under which exceptions are thrown are drastically different.\n- **LLM-based validation:** Low LLM assessed equivalence (0.2) with high confidence (0.9) - strongly indicates non-equivalence.\n- **Combined assessment:**  Low confidence in semantic equivalence (0.67) - supports the conclusion that the patches are not semantically equivalent.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as **INCORRECT** because it fundamentally misunderstands the issue and implements a completely different and flawed approach compared to the ground truth patch.\n\nThe ground truth patch directly addresses the bug by checking the class type and ensuring that `createInstance()` is either called on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself or overridden by subclasses. This is a clear and targeted fix.\n\nThe generated patch, on the other hand, attempts to check for `writeObject` method overriding using reflection. This approach is:\n1. **Unrelated to the bug:** The issue is about `createInstance()` and its intended behavior in subclasses, not `writeObject`. There is no logical connection between the need to override `createInstance()` and the presence or absence of `writeObject` overriding.\n2. **Incorrect in its logic:** Even if there were a hypothetical connection, checking `writeObject` overriding is not a valid way to enforce the requirement for overriding `createInstance()`.\n3. **Misleading error message:** The exception message refers to `writeObject`, which is confusing and irrelevant to the actual problem.\n4. **Potentially breaks correct subclass behavior:** A subclass might correctly override `createInstance()` but not `writeObject` (or vice versa). The generated patch could incorrectly throw an exception in valid scenarios or fail to throw an exception in invalid scenarios.\n5. **Semantic equivalence tests confirm non-equivalence:** All automated tests indicate that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth.\n\nIn summary, the generated patch is based on a flawed premise, implements incorrect logic, and does not correctly address the bug described in the issue. It is therefore classified as **INCORRECT**.",

This is not optimal (ideally check would be done compile-time), but better than getting a mysterious failure.\n\n[Trigger Test 1]\nTest Name: testInvalidSubClass\nTest Source:     public void testInvalidSubClass() throws Exception\n\n    {\n\n        DefaultPrettyPrinter pp = new MyPrettyPrinter();\n\n        try {\n\n            pp.createInstance();\n\n            fail(\"Should not pass\");\n\n        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\n\n            verifyException(e, \"does not override\");\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nError Message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Should not pass\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.core.util.TestDefaultPrettyPrinter.testInvalidSubClass(TestDefaultPrettyPrinter.java:169)  fail(\"Should not pass\");\n\n[Ground Truth Patch]: public DefaultPrettyPrinter createInstance() {\n    if (getClass() != DefaultPrettyPrinter.class) { // since 2.10\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Failed `createInstance()`: \"+getClass().getName()\n                +\" does not override method; it has to\");\n    }\n    return new DefaultPrettyPrinter(this);\n}\n[Generated Patch]: public DefaultPrettyPrinter createInstance() {\n    return createInstance(getClass());\n}\n\nprivate DefaultPrettyPrinter createInstance(Class<?> clazz) {\n    if (!clazz.equals(DefaultPrettyPrinter.class) && !clazz.getSuperclass().equals(DefaultPrettyPrinter.class)) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Subclass is not a subclass of DefaultPrettyPrinter\");\n    }\n    try {\n        if (!clazz.getMethod(\"writeObject\", Object.class).getDeclaringClass().equals(clazz)) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Subclass does not override writeObject method\");\n        }\n    } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Subclass does not have writeObject method\");\n    }\n    try {\n        return clazz.getConstructor(DefaultPrettyPrinter.class).newInstance(this);\n    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | InvocationTargetException e) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Failed to create instance of subclass\", e);\n    }\n}\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST analysis using wrapped method parsing: Structural similarity score: 0.50.

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Directly checks if the `getClass()` is exactly `DefaultPrettyPrinter.class`. If it's a subclass, it throws an `IllegalStateException`. This enforces that `createInstance()` should only be called on `DefaultPrettyPrinter` itself, not subclasses, unless overridden.\n- **Generated Patch:** Introduces a new private method `createInstance(Class<?> clazz)`. This method attempts to be more flexible but introduces flawed logic.\n    - It checks if `clazz` is `DefaultPrettyPrinter` or its direct subclass using `!clazz.equals(DefaultPrettyPrinter.class) && !clazz.getSuperclass().equals(DefaultPrettyPrinter.class)`. This condition is incorrect for checking direct subclasses and will fail for subclasses of subclasses.\n    - It checks for the existence and overriding of `writeObject(Object.class)`, which is irrelevant to the issue of `createInstance()` and seems like a misplaced or misunderstood requirement.\n    - It attempts to create a new instance using `clazz.getConstructor(DefaultPrettyPrinter.class).newInstance(this)`. This is also problematic as it assumes subclasses have a constructor taking `DefaultPrettyPrinter` which is not guaranteed and not the intended behavior.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The ground truth patch strictly prevents `createInstance()` from being called on subclasses without overriding. The generated patch attempts a more complex and flawed approach that tries to dynamically instantiate subclasses based on incorrect and irrelevant checks. The generated patch's logic is significantly different and not aligned with the intended fix.\n- **Edge Cases:** The generated patch introduces more complex edge cases due to its flawed subclass and `writeObject` checks. It might throw exceptions in scenarios where the ground truth patch would not, and vice versa, due to the incorrect logic.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input - calling on `DefaultPrettyPrinter`):** Both patches should return a new `DefaultPrettyPrinter` instance.\n- **Missing/null values:** Not directly applicable to this method as it takes no input.\n- **Out of bounds values:** Not directly applicable.\n- **Invalid inputs (calling on subclass):**\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:** Throws `IllegalStateException`.\n    - **Generated Patch:**  Intends to throw `IllegalStateException` based on its checks, but the conditions are different and flawed. It might throw `IllegalStateException` for different reasons and in different scenarios compared to the ground truth patch due to its incorrect logic.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Throws `IllegalStateException` with a clear message indicating the subclass needs to override the method.\n- **Generated Patch:** Throws `IllegalStateException` with various messages depending on which check fails: \"Subclass is not a subclass of DefaultPrettyPrinter\", \"Subclass does not override writeObject method\", \"Subclass does not have writeObject method\", \"Failed to create instance of subclass\". These messages are less focused on the core issue (overriding `createInstance()`) and more on the flawed checks implemented in the generated patch. The error handling is more verbose and less helpful in diagnosing the intended problem.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Will patch pass the trigger test?** Yes, both patches are designed to throw `IllegalStateException` in the `testInvalidSubClass` scenario, so both should pass the trigger test.\n- **Are there potential issues with other tests?** Yes, the generated patch's complex and flawed logic could introduce regressions or unexpected behavior in other parts of the code that might rely on the specific behavior of `createInstance()` or its error conditions. The ground truth patch is simpler and less likely to cause unintended side effects.\n- **Could behavior changes affect dependent code?** Yes, the generated patch's behavior is significantly different and could affect dependent code in unpredictable ways due to its flawed logic and different error conditions.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Low structural similarity confirms the patches are structurally very different.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Low control flow similarity further indicates behavioral differences.\n- **LLM-based validation:**  Clearly states the generated patch has flawed logic and is not equivalent.\n- **Combined assessment:**  Strongly indicates the patches are not semantically equivalent.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as **INCORRECT** because it introduces a significantly more complex and flawed implementation compared to the ground truth patch.\n- **Incorrect Subclass Check:** The generated patch uses an incorrect condition to check for direct subclasses, which will not work as intended.\n- **Irrelevant `writeObject` Check:** The check for `writeObject` overriding is completely unrelated to the bug fix and introduces unnecessary complexity and confusion.\n- **Flawed Instance Creation:** The attempt to dynamically create instances of subclasses using reflection and assuming a specific constructor is incorrect and not aligned with the intended behavior.\n- **Different Error Messages:** The generated patch throws `IllegalStateException` with different and less informative error messages compared to the ground truth patch.\n- **Semantic Non-Equivalence:** Semantic equivalence tests and detailed analysis confirm that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth and introduces significant behavioral differences and flawed logic.\n\nIn summary, the generated patch is overly complex, contains incorrect logic, and deviates significantly from the simple and correct fix provided by the ground truth patch. It is not a correct solution to the bug and is likely to introduce regressions and unexpected behavior.",
