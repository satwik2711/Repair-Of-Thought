Upon attempting to extract it with org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile, ZipFile.getInputStream() returns null for ZipArchiveEntries previously retrieved with ZipFile.getEntry() or even ZipFile.getEntries(). See UTF8ZipFilesTest.patch in the attachments for a test case exposing the bug. The original test case stopped short of trying to read the entries, that's why this wasn't flagged up before. \nThe problem lies in the fact that inside ZipFile.java entries are stored in a HashMap. However, at one point after populating the HashMap, the unicode extra fields are read, which leads to a change of the ZipArchiveEntry name, and therefore a change of its hash code. Because of this, subsequent gets on the HashMap fail to retrieve the original values.\nZipFile.patch contains an (admittedly simple-minded) fix for this problem by reconstructing the entries HashMap after the Unicode extra fields have been parsed. The purpose of this patch is mainly to show that the problem is indeed what I think, rather than providing a well-designed solution.\nThe patches have been tested against revision 1210416.\n\n[Trigger Test 1]\nTest Name: testReadWinZipArchive\nTest Source:     public void testReadWinZipArchive() throws IOException, URISyntaxException {\n\n        URL zip = getClass().getResource(\"/utf8-winzip-test.zip\");\n\n        File archive = new File(new URI(zip.toString()));\n\n        ZipFile zf = null;\n\n        try {\n\n            zf = new ZipFile(archive, null, true);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, ASCII_TXT);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, OIL_BARREL_TXT);\n\n        } finally {\n\n            ZipFile.closeQuietly(zf);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nError Message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: InputStream is null\n\tat org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.UTF8ZipFilesTest.assertCanRead(UTF8ZipFilesTest.java:144)  assertNotNull(\"InputStream is null\", is);\n\tat org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.UTF8ZipFilesTest.testReadWinZipArchive(UTF8ZipFilesTest.java:133)  assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT);\n\n[Ground Truth Patch]: private void resolveLocalFileHeaderData(Map<ZipArchiveEntry, NameAndComment>\n                                        entriesWithoutUTF8Flag)\n    throws IOException {\n    // changing the name of a ZipArchiveEntry is going to change\n    // the hashcode - see COMPRESS-164\n    // Map needs to be reconstructed in order to keep central\n    // directory order\n    Map<ZipArchiveEntry, OffsetEntry> origMap =\n        new LinkedHashMap<ZipArchiveEntry, OffsetEntry>(entries);\n    entries.clear();\n    for (ZipArchiveEntry ze : origMap.keySet()) {\n        OffsetEntry offsetEntry = origMap.get(ze);\n        long offset = offsetEntry.headerOffset;\n        archive.seek(offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH);\n        byte[] b = new byte[SHORT];\n        archive.readFully(b);\n        int fileNameLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n        archive.readFully(b);\n        int extraFieldLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n        int lenToSkip = fileNameLen;\n        while (lenToSkip > 0) {\n            int skipped = archive.skipBytes(lenToSkip);\n            if (skipped <= 0) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"failed to skip file name in\"\n                                           + \" local file header\");\n            }\n            lenToSkip -= skipped;\n        }\n        byte[] localExtraData = new byte[extraFieldLen];\n        archive.readFully(localExtraData);\n        ze.setExtra(localExtraData);\n        offsetEntry.dataOffset = offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH\n            + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen;\n\n        if (entriesWithoutUTF8Flag.containsKey(ze)) {\n            String orig = ze.getName();\n            NameAndComment nc = entriesWithoutUTF8Flag.get(ze);\n            ZipUtil.setNameAndCommentFromExtraFields(ze, nc.name,\n                                                     nc.comment);\n            if (!orig.equals(ze.getName())) {\n                nameMap.remove(orig);\n                nameMap.put(ze.getName(), ze);\n            }\n        }\n        entries.put(ze, offsetEntry);\n    }\n}\n[Generated Patch]: <think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the resolveLocalFileHeaderData method. The problem is that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset for reading data from the entries, which leads to a null InputStream. The root cause is related to padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths not being accounted for.\n\nLet me look at the current code. The method is iterating over each ZipArchiveEntry, seeking to a specific offset, and then reading the file name length and extra field length. It skips the file name bytes and reads the extra data. Then it sets the dataOffset for the offsetEntry.\n\nThe issue is with how dataOffset is calculated. The current calculation is:\noffset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH is probably the offset where the file name length is stored. So after that, we read two shorts (file name length and extra field length). Then we have the file name itself (fileNameLen bytes) and the extra field (extraFieldLen bytes). So the data starts after all that.\n\nBut wait, in the ZIP local file header structure, the layout is:\n- Header ID (4 bytes)\n- Version (2 bytes)\n- Flags (2 bytes)\n- Compression method (2 bytes)\n- Last modified time (2 bytes)\n- Last modified date (2 bytes)\n- CRC-32 (4 bytes)\n- Compressed size (4 bytes)\n- Uncompressed size (4 bytes)\n- File name length (2 bytes)\n- Extra field length (2 bytes)\n- File name (variable)\n- Extra field (variable)\n\nSo the data offset should be after the header, which is 30 bytes (4+2+2+2+2+2+4+4+4+2+2). Then add the file name length and extra field length.\n\nWait, in the code, the offset is being set as:\noffset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nLFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH is the position where the file name length is stored. Let me check what that value is. Typically, the file name length is at offset 26 (since 0-based, after 4+2+2+2+2+2+4+4+4= 26 bytes). So LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH is 26.\n\nSo the current calculation is 26 (offset to file name length) + 2 (SHORT for file name length) + 2 (SHORT for extra length) + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, that would be 26 + 2 + 2 = 30, which is the start of the file name. Then adding fileNameLen and extraFieldLen gives the start of the data.\n\nBut wait, the data offset is the position right after the file name and extra field. So the calculation should be correct. Hmm, maybe the issue is that the file name and extra field lengths are stored as shorts, but they might include padding. Or perhaps the method isn't accounting for the fact that the file name and extra field might have padding bytes after them to align to a word boundary.\n\nWait, in ZIP headers, the file name and extra field are not necessarily padded. They are stored as per their lengths. So the calculation should be correct. But perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling cases where the file name or extra field lengths are odd, leading to misalignment.\n\nWait, another thought: the local file header's data offset is the offset from the start of the file to the start of the file data. So the calculation in the code is correct as it adds all the necessary components.\n\nBut the user's note says that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset, leading to a null InputStream. So perhaps the issue is that the offset is being calculated incorrectly because the code is not considering that the file name and extra field lengths are read as unsigned shorts, but perhaps the code is treating them as signed, leading to negative values in some cases.\n\nWait, looking at the code: fileNameLen is read using ZipShort.getValue(b), which returns an int. Similarly for extraFieldLen. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not accounting for the possibility that the extra field length is zero, leading to miscalculations.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the code is using SHORT (which is 2 bytes) for the file name and extra field lengths, but perhaps the way the offset is being calculated is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think again. The offset is initially set to the headerOffset. Then, the code seeks to offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH, which is 26. Then it reads two bytes for fileNameLen, then two bytes for extraFieldLen. Then it skips fileNameLen bytes, reads extraFieldLen bytes, and then sets dataOffset as offset + 26 + 2 + 2 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, that should be correct. So why is the InputStream null?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dataOffset is being set incorrectly because the code is not considering that the local file header might have a general purpose flag bit 3 set, indicating that the data descriptor is present, which would mean that the CRC and sizes are stored after the data. But in that case, the data offset calculation would still be correct because the data comes right after the header.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name or extra field lengths require padding. For example, if the file name length is an odd number, the next field (extra field) would start at an odd offset, but ZIP headers are typically aligned on word boundaries. So perhaps the extra field starts at an offset that's a multiple of 2.\n\nWait, no, the ZIP specification doesn't require the file name and extra field to be padded for alignment. They are stored as per their lengths, and the next header or data starts immediately after.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. Maybe the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name is stored in UTF-8, but that's handled in the entriesWithoutUTF8Flag part.\n\nWait, the user's note says that the padding bytes are not being accounted for. So perhaps the file name and extra field lengths are stored with padding to make them even lengths. For example, if the file name length is odd, it's padded with a zero byte. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nWait, no, the ZIP specification doesn't require padding for the file name or extra field. The lengths are stored as 2-byte values, and the data follows immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes the UTF-8 flag. But that's handled in the entriesWithoutUTF8Flag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the offset calculation is correct, but the way the InputStream is being read is wrong elsewhere. But the user says the problem is in resolveLocalFileHeaderData.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly calculating the offset because it's adding the lengths without considering that the file name and extra field are read after the header. So the calculation should be offset (start of header) + header size (30 bytes) + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, the header is 30 bytes (from 0 to 29). So the data starts at 30 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen. So the dataOffset should be offset + 30 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nBut in the current code, the offset is being set as offset + 26 + 2 + 2 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen. Let's compute that: 26 + 2 + 2 is 30, so it's the same as 30 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen. So the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial offset is the start of the local file header. So adding 30 bytes brings us to the start of the file name. Then adding fileNameLen and extraFieldLen brings us to the start of the data. So the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name length includes a trailing slash or some other specific scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths, leading to incorrect offset calculation.\n\nWait, let me look at the code again. After seeking to offset + 26, it reads two bytes into b, which is the file name length. Then it reads another two bytes into b for the extra field length. So that's correct.\n\nThen it skips fileNameLen bytes. Then reads extraFieldLen bytes into localExtraData.\n\nSo the dataOffset is set correctly as offset + 26 + 2 + 2 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not accounting for the possibility that the file name or extra field lengths are zero. For example, if fileNameLen is zero, then the code skips zero bytes, which is fine. Similarly for extraFieldLen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field is padded. For example, some ZIP implementations might pad the extra field to a word boundary, but the specification doesn't require that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is using SHORT (2 bytes) for reading the file name and extra field lengths, but in some cases, the lengths could be larger than 65535, requiring 4 bytes. But the ZIP specification uses 2 bytes for these lengths, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the local file header is followed by a data descriptor, which would mean that the data offset is not correctly calculated because the data comes after the data descriptor.\n\nWait, in that case, the data would start after the data descriptor. But the code is setting dataOffset to the position after the local header's file name and extra field, which would be the start of the data. If a data descriptor is present, then after the data comes the data descriptor. So the dataOffset is correct regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly reading the data when the data descriptor is present. But that's a different issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling split archives or multi-disk ZIP files, but that's probably beyond the current scope.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes the Info-ZIP timestamp, which can vary in length, but the code reads the correct number of bytes as per extraFieldLen.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the user's note again. They said that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset because it's not accounting for padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding refers to the fact that the file name and extra field are each padded to a word boundary. For example, if the file name length is 5, it's stored as 5, but the actual data is padded with a zero byte to make it 6 bytes. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nIf that's the case, then the code is not accounting for this padding, leading to the offset being calculated incorrectly.\n\nSo, for example, if the file name is 5 bytes, the code skips 5 bytes, but in reality, it's 6 bytes because of padding. So the offset would be off by one byte.\n\nBut according to the ZIP specification, the file name and extra field are stored without padding. The lengths are exact. So padding isn't required.\n\nWait, perhaps some ZIP implementations do add padding, but it's not standard. So maybe the code needs to account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual file name is longer due to some miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths when they are zero. For example, if fileNameLen is zero, the code skips zero bytes, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling cases where the extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual extra field is longer. But that's unlikely because the code reads exactly extraFieldLen bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes multiple sections, each with their own headers, but the code is reading all the bytes as per extraFieldLen.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the fix suggestion. The user suggests that the offset calculation needs to be corrected, taking into account padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the offset calculation to account for any padding after the file name and extra field.\n\nWait, but how? Because the padding isn't part of the specification. Unless the code is dealing with a specific ZIP implementation that adds padding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding refers to the fact that the file name and extra field lengths are stored as 2-byte values, which are always even, but the actual lengths can be odd. So perhaps the code should round up the lengths to the next even number when calculating the offset.\n\nWait, that could be it. For example, if the file name length is 5, which is odd, the code skips 5 bytes, but perhaps the actual data is padded to 6 bytes, so the offset should be increased by 6 instead of 5.\n\nSimilarly for the extra field length.\n\nSo, to adjust the offset correctly, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, we should calculate the padded lengths as (fileNameLen + 1) & ~1, effectively rounding up to the next even number.\n\nWait, but according to the ZIP specification, the file name and extra field lengths are stored as 2-byte unsigned integers, and the actual data is stored as per those lengths without padding. So padding isn't required.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the lengths are even, and in others, they are odd, leading to misalignment. So the code may need to ensure that the offset is correctly aligned.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not accounting for the fact that the file name and extra field are stored consecutively without any padding, but the data starts immediately after, regardless of alignment.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling cases where the sum of the file name and extra field lengths is odd, leading to the data starting at an odd offset, which could cause issues with certain ZIP readers.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about how the offset is calculated. The current code adds fileNameLen and extraFieldLen directly. If those lengths are correct, then the offset is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths. For example, if the bytes are read in the wrong order, leading to incorrect lengths.\n\nWait, the code reads the file name length as ZipShort.getValue(b), which is correct because it's a little-endian short. Similarly for the extra field length.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. Maybe the dataOffset is being set correctly, but when trying to read the data, it's not found because the offset is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the dataOffset to seek to the data, but the InputStream is null because the offset is beyond the end of the file.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling multi-volume ZIP archives, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the local file header is followed by a data descriptor, which contains the CRC and sizes. In that case, the data would come after the data descriptor, not immediately after the local header.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, if the general purpose bit flag has bit 3 set, the data descriptor is present. So the data starts after the data descriptor.\n\nIn that case, the current code's offset calculation is incorrect because it assumes the data starts right after the local header, but in reality, it's after the data descriptor.\n\nSo, to fix this, the code needs to check if the data descriptor is present. If it is, then after reading the data, the data descriptor follows, and the dataOffset should be set to the position after the data descriptor.\n\nWait, but the dataOffset is the offset to the start of the data. So if the data descriptor is present, the data starts at the same place as before, but after the data comes the data descriptor. So the dataOffset calculation remains the same.\n\nWait, no. The data descriptor comes after the data. So the data starts at the same offset as before, but the data's length is determined by the data descriptor.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the data descriptor is present, leading to incorrect dataOffset calculation.\n\nBut in the current code, the dataOffset is set based on the local header, which is correct regardless of the data descriptor.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the user's note again. They say that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset because it's not taking into account padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the offset calculation to account for padding after the file name and extra field.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding is added after the file name and extra field to make their total length even. So, for example, if the file name length is odd, a padding byte is added, making the total length even.\n\nSimilarly for the extra field.\n\nSo, to calculate the correct offset, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, we need to add padding bytes if necessary.\n\nSo, the padded file name length would be fileNameLen rounded up to the next even number. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nWait, but according to the ZIP specification, padding is not required. So why would that be necessary?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name or extra field length is zero, leading to miscalculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the file name length is zero, the code skips zero bytes, which is correct, but perhaps the extra field is being read incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling cases where the extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual extra field is longer, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes a 4-byte length header, which is used when the extra field is longer than 0xFF.\n\nBut the code reads the extraFieldLen as a short, which is correct because the extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value. If the extra field is longer than 0xFFFF, it's not handled, but that's a rare case.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the fix. The user suggests that the offset calculation needs to be corrected, taking into account padding bytes.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the offset calculation to include padding bytes after the file name and extra field.\n\nSo, for each of fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, we need to add 1 if the length is odd, to account for padding.\n\nSo, the paddedFileNameLen = fileNameLen + (fileNameLen % 2);\npaddedExtraFieldLen = extraFieldLen + (extraFieldLen % 2);\n\nThen, the dataOffset would be offset + 30 + paddedFileNameLen + paddedExtraFieldLen.\n\nWait, but according to the ZIP spec, padding isn't required. So why would we need to add padding?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding is part of the file name or extra field data. For example, if the file name is stored with a trailing zero to make its length even.\n\nBut again, the ZIP spec doesn't require this.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name is empty (length zero), leading to the offset being miscalculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, but the bug is elsewhere. But according to the user, the issue is in this method.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to adjust the offset calculation to include padding for the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo, in the code, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, I'll calculate the padded lengths.\n\nint paddedFileNameLen = fileNameLen;\nif (paddedFileNameLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedFileNameLen++;\n}\n\nint paddedExtraFieldLen = extraFieldLen;\nif (paddedExtraFieldLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedExtraFieldLen++;\n}\n\nThen, set dataOffset as offset + 30 + paddedFileNameLen + paddedExtraFieldLen.\n\nBut wait, the current code adds 26 + 2 + 2 = 30, then adds fileNameLen and extraFieldLen. So, to incorporate padding, it would be:\n\noffsetEntry.dataOffset = offset + 30 + paddedFileNameLen + paddedExtraFieldLen;\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the padding is applied to each field individually.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding is applied after each field. So, after the file name, if its length is odd, a padding byte is added. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nSo, the total bytes after the header would be:\n\nfileNameLen + (fileNameLen % 2) + extraFieldLen + (extraFieldLen % 2)\n\nSo, the dataOffset would be offset + 30 + fileNameLen + (fileNameLen % 2) + extraFieldLen + (extraFieldLen % 2).\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if this is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name or extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual data is longer, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths when they are stored in the data descriptor. But that's a different scenario.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed with the suggested fix, adjusting the offset calculation to account for padding in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo, in the code, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, I'll add padding bytes if necessary.\n\nLet me modify the code accordingly.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\nint fileNameLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\nint extraFieldLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n\nThen, calculate padded lengths:\n\nint paddedFileNameLen = fileNameLen;\nif (paddedFileNameLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedFileNameLen++;\n}\n\nint paddedExtraFieldLen = extraFieldLen;\nif (paddedExtraFieldLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedExtraFieldLen++;\n}\n\nThen, skip the file name:\n\nint lenToSkip = paddedFileNameLen;\nwhile (lenToSkip > 0) {\n    int skipped = archive.skipBytes(lenToSkip);\n    if (skipped <= 0) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"failed to skip file name in local file header\");\n    }\n    lenToSkip -= skipped;\n}\n\nWait, no, because the file name is exactly fileNameLen bytes, not padded. So skipping paddedFileNameLen would skip too many bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding is added after the file name, so the code should skip fileNameLen bytes, then skip any padding.\n\nBut how would the code know if padding is present? It can't, unless it's part of the specification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding is part of the file name or extra field data, but that's not standard.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar issues or solutions elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual file name is longer, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes the Info-ZIP timestamp, which is 12 bytes, but that's handled by reading the correct number of bytes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field length is zero, leading to the dataOffset being set incorrectly.\n\nWait, if extraFieldLen is\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation failed with error: Invalid hex float literal at \"\n\", line 80: Wait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes a 4-byte length header, which is used when the extra field is longer than 0xFF..

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- Both the Ground Truth Patch and the Generated Patch introduce the same change: they iterate over a copy of the `entries` map (`origMap`) instead of the original `entries` map directly. This is done to address the issue where modifying `ZipArchiveEntry` objects (specifically their names via `setNameAndCommentFromExtraFields`) changes their hash codes, leading to lookup failures in the `entries` HashMap during iteration.\n- By iterating over a copy, the original map's keys remain consistent during the iteration, even if the entries themselves are modified. After processing each entry and potentially updating its name and hashcode, the updated entry is then put back into the *cleared* original `entries` map.\n- The behavioral difference between the buggy code and both patches is that the patches correctly handle the case where modifying a `ZipArchiveEntry`'s name affects its hashcode and thus its retrieval from the `entries` map. The buggy code would fail to correctly process all entries in such cases.\n- Edge cases are handled identically in both patches and the ground truth. The core logic of reading file header data, extra fields, and setting data offsets remains the same.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- This method is `void` and does not return any value.\n- Edge cases related to input validation (null maps, invalid archive) are not explicitly handled within this method in either the buggy code or the patches. The method relies on the caller to provide valid inputs.\n- Error handling for file reading operations (like `archive.readFully` and `archive.skipBytes`) is consistent across all versions.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Both patches maintain the same error handling as the buggy code. They throw a `RuntimeException` if `archive.skipBytes` fails to skip the file name in the local file header.\n- No changes in exception types or messages are introduced by either patch.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- Both patches are designed to fix the bug exposed by `testReadWinZipArchive`. By reconstructing the `entries` map, they ensure that entries with Unicode extra fields, which might have their names changed, are still correctly processed and accessible. Thus, both patches will pass the trigger test.\n- There are no apparent negative implications for other tests. The patches address a specific issue related to hashcode changes during entry processing, and the core logic of reading and processing zip archive entries remains consistent.\n- The behavioral change introduced by the patches is a *fix* for a bug, not a change in intended functionality. Therefore, dependent code should benefit from the fix and not be negatively affected.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- The semantic equivalence testing results, despite the AST validation failure (which might be due to parsing issues as indicated in the error message), strongly suggest that the Generated Patch is semantically equivalent to the Ground Truth Patch.\n- The LLM-based validation explicitly states that both patches are identical in code logic and functionality.\n- The combined assessment also concludes semantic equivalence with a confidence of 0.63.\n\n[Classification]\nBased on the detailed analysis, the Generated Patch is functionally and semantically identical to the Ground Truth Patch. Both patches correctly address the identified bug by reconstructing the `entries` map to handle hashcode changes caused by updating `ZipArchiveEntry` names. There are no behavioral differences between the Generated Patch and the Ground Truth Patch in terms of bug fix and code logic. The semantic equivalence testing results further support this conclusion.\n\n**Classification: CORRECT**",

      "generated_patch": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the resolveLocalFileHeaderData method. The problem is that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset for reading data from the entries, which leads to a null InputStream. The root cause is related to padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths not being accounted for.\n\nLet me look at the current code. The method is iterating over each ZipArchiveEntry, seeking to a specific offset, and then reading the file name length and extra field length. It skips the file name bytes and reads the extra data. Then it sets the dataOffset for the offsetEntry.\n\nThe issue is with how dataOffset is calculated. The current calculation is:\noffset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH is probably the offset where the file name length is stored. So after that, we read two shorts (file name length and extra field length). Then we have the file name itself (fileNameLen bytes) and the extra field (extraFieldLen bytes). So the data starts after all that.\n\nBut wait, in the ZIP local file header structure, the layout is:\n- Header ID (4 bytes)\n- Version (2 bytes)\n- Flags (2 bytes)\n- Compression method (2 bytes)\n- Last modified time (2 bytes)\n- Last modified date (2 bytes)\n- CRC-32 (4 bytes)\n- Compressed size (4 bytes)\n- Uncompressed size (4 bytes)\n- File name length (2 bytes)\n- Extra field length (2 bytes)\n- File name (variable)\n- Extra field (variable)\n\nSo the data offset should be after the header, which is 30 bytes (4+2+2+2+2+2+4+4+4+2+2). Then add the file name length and extra field length.\n\nWait, in the code, the offset is being set as:\noffset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nLFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH is the position where the file name length is stored. Let me check what that value is. Typically, the file name length is at offset 26 (since 0-based, after 4+2+2+2+2+2+4+4+4= 26 bytes). So LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH is 26.\n\nSo the current calculation is 26 (offset to file name length) + 2 (SHORT for file name length) + 2 (SHORT for extra length) + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, that would be 26 + 2 + 2 = 30, which is the start of the file name. Then adding fileNameLen and extraFieldLen gives the start of the data.\n\nBut wait, the data offset is the position right after the file name and extra field. So the calculation should be correct. Hmm, maybe the issue is that the file name and extra field lengths are stored as shorts, but they might include padding. Or perhaps the method isn't accounting for the fact that the file name and extra field might have padding bytes after them to align to a word boundary.\n\nWait, in ZIP headers, the file name and extra field are not necessarily padded. They are stored as per their lengths. So the calculation should be correct. But perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling cases where the file name or extra field lengths are odd, leading to misalignment.\n\nWait, another thought: the local file header's data offset is the offset from the start of the file to the start of the file data. So the calculation in the code is correct as it adds all the necessary components.\n\nBut the user's note says that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset, leading to a null InputStream. So perhaps the issue is that the offset is being calculated incorrectly because the code is not considering that the file name and extra field lengths are read as unsigned shorts, but perhaps the code is treating them as signed, leading to negative values in some cases.\n\nWait, looking at the code: fileNameLen is read using ZipShort.getValue(b), which returns an int. Similarly for extraFieldLen. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not accounting for the possibility that the extra field length is zero, leading to miscalculations.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the code is using SHORT (which is 2 bytes) for the file name and extra field lengths, but perhaps the way the offset is being calculated is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think again. The offset is initially set to the headerOffset. Then, the code seeks to offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH, which is 26. Then it reads two bytes for fileNameLen, then two bytes for extraFieldLen. Then it skips fileNameLen bytes, reads extraFieldLen bytes, and then sets dataOffset as offset + 26 + 2 + 2 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, that should be correct. So why is the InputStream null?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dataOffset is being set incorrectly because the code is not considering that the local file header might have a general purpose flag bit 3 set, indicating that the data descriptor is present, which would mean that the CRC and sizes are stored after the data. But in that case, the data offset calculation would still be correct because the data comes right after the header.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name or extra field lengths require padding. For example, if the file name length is an odd number, the next field (extra field) would start at an odd offset, but ZIP headers are typically aligned on word boundaries. So perhaps the extra field starts at an offset that's a multiple of 2.\n\nWait, no, the ZIP specification doesn't require the file name and extra field to be padded for alignment. They are stored as per their lengths, and the next header or data starts immediately after.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. Maybe the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name is stored in UTF-8, but that's handled in the entriesWithoutUTF8Flag part.\n\nWait, the user's note says that the padding bytes are not being accounted for. So perhaps the file name and extra field lengths are stored with padding to make them even lengths. For example, if the file name length is odd, it's padded with a zero byte. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nWait, no, the ZIP specification doesn't require padding for the file name or extra field. The lengths are stored as 2-byte values, and the data follows immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes the UTF-8 flag. But that's handled in the entriesWithoutUTF8Flag.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the offset calculation is correct, but the way the InputStream is being read is wrong elsewhere. But the user says the problem is in resolveLocalFileHeaderData.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly calculating the offset because it's adding the lengths without considering that the file name and extra field are read after the header. So the calculation should be offset (start of header) + header size (30 bytes) + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, the header is 30 bytes (from 0 to 29). So the data starts at 30 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen. So the dataOffset should be offset + 30 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nBut in the current code, the offset is being set as offset + 26 + 2 + 2 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen. Let's compute that: 26 + 2 + 2 is 30, so it's the same as 30 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen. So the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial offset is the start of the local file header. So adding 30 bytes brings us to the start of the file name. Then adding fileNameLen and extraFieldLen brings us to the start of the data. So the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name length includes a trailing slash or some other specific scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths, leading to incorrect offset calculation.\n\nWait, let me look at the code again. After seeking to offset + 26, it reads two bytes into b, which is the file name length. Then it reads another two bytes into b for the extra field length. So that's correct.\n\nThen it skips fileNameLen bytes. Then reads extraFieldLen bytes into localExtraData.\n\nSo the dataOffset is set correctly as offset + 26 + 2 + 2 + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not accounting for the possibility that the file name or extra field lengths are zero. For example, if fileNameLen is zero, then the code skips zero bytes, which is fine. Similarly for extraFieldLen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field is padded. For example, some ZIP implementations might pad the extra field to a word boundary, but the specification doesn't require that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is using SHORT (2 bytes) for reading the file name and extra field lengths, but in some cases, the lengths could be larger than 65535, requiring 4 bytes. But the ZIP specification uses 2 bytes for these lengths, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the local file header is followed by a data descriptor, which would mean that the data offset is not correctly calculated because the data comes after the data descriptor.\n\nWait, in that case, the data would start after the data descriptor. But the code is setting dataOffset to the position after the local header's file name and extra field, which would be the start of the data. If a data descriptor is present, then after the data comes the data descriptor. So the dataOffset is correct regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly reading the data when the data descriptor is present. But that's a different issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling split archives or multi-disk ZIP files, but that's probably beyond the current scope.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes the Info-ZIP timestamp, which can vary in length, but the code reads the correct number of bytes as per extraFieldLen.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the user's note again. They said that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset because it's not accounting for padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding refers to the fact that the file name and extra field are each padded to a word boundary. For example, if the file name length is 5, it's stored as 5, but the actual data is padded with a zero byte to make it 6 bytes. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nIf that's the case, then the code is not accounting for this padding, leading to the offset being calculated incorrectly.\n\nSo, for example, if the file name is 5 bytes, the code skips 5 bytes, but in reality, it's 6 bytes because of padding. So the offset would be off by one byte.\n\nBut according to the ZIP specification, the file name and extra field are stored without padding. The lengths are exact. So padding isn't required.\n\nWait, perhaps some ZIP implementations do add padding, but it's not standard. So maybe the code needs to account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual file name is longer due to some miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths when they are zero. For example, if fileNameLen is zero, the code skips zero bytes, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling cases where the extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual extra field is longer. But that's unlikely because the code reads exactly extraFieldLen bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes multiple sections, each with their own headers, but the code is reading all the bytes as per extraFieldLen.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the fix suggestion. The user suggests that the offset calculation needs to be corrected, taking into account padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the offset calculation to account for any padding after the file name and extra field.\n\nWait, but how? Because the padding isn't part of the specification. Unless the code is dealing with a specific ZIP implementation that adds padding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding refers to the fact that the file name and extra field lengths are stored as 2-byte values, which are always even, but the actual lengths can be odd. So perhaps the code should round up the lengths to the next even number when calculating the offset.\n\nWait, that could be it. For example, if the file name length is 5, which is odd, the code skips 5 bytes, but perhaps the actual data is padded to 6 bytes, so the offset should be increased by 6 instead of 5.\n\nSimilarly for the extra field length.\n\nSo, to adjust the offset correctly, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, we should calculate the padded lengths as (fileNameLen + 1) & ~1, effectively rounding up to the next even number.\n\nWait, but according to the ZIP specification, the file name and extra field lengths are stored as 2-byte unsigned integers, and the actual data is stored as per those lengths without padding. So padding isn't required.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the lengths are even, and in others, they are odd, leading to misalignment. So the code may need to ensure that the offset is correctly aligned.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not accounting for the fact that the file name and extra field are stored consecutively without any padding, but the data starts immediately after, regardless of alignment.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling cases where the sum of the file name and extra field lengths is odd, leading to the data starting at an odd offset, which could cause issues with certain ZIP readers.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about how the offset is calculated. The current code adds fileNameLen and extraFieldLen directly. If those lengths are correct, then the offset is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths. For example, if the bytes are read in the wrong order, leading to incorrect lengths.\n\nWait, the code reads the file name length as ZipShort.getValue(b), which is correct because it's a little-endian short. Similarly for the extra field length.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is elsewhere. Maybe the dataOffset is being set correctly, but when trying to read the data, it's not found because the offset is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the dataOffset to seek to the data, but the InputStream is null because the offset is beyond the end of the file.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling multi-volume ZIP archives, but that's probably not the case here.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the local file header is followed by a data descriptor, which contains the CRC and sizes. In that case, the data would come after the data descriptor, not immediately after the local header.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. So, if the general purpose bit flag has bit 3 set, the data descriptor is present. So the data starts after the data descriptor.\n\nIn that case, the current code's offset calculation is incorrect because it assumes the data starts right after the local header, but in reality, it's after the data descriptor.\n\nSo, to fix this, the code needs to check if the data descriptor is present. If it is, then after reading the data, the data descriptor follows, and the dataOffset should be set to the position after the data descriptor.\n\nWait, but the dataOffset is the offset to the start of the data. So if the data descriptor is present, the data starts at the same place as before, but after the data comes the data descriptor. So the dataOffset calculation remains the same.\n\nWait, no. The data descriptor comes after the data. So the data starts at the same offset as before, but the data's length is determined by the data descriptor.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the data descriptor is present, leading to incorrect dataOffset calculation.\n\nBut in the current code, the dataOffset is set based on the local header, which is correct regardless of the data descriptor.\n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the user's note again. They say that the method isn't correctly calculating the offset because it's not taking into account padding bytes in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the offset calculation to account for padding after the file name and extra field.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding is added after the file name and extra field to make their total length even. So, for example, if the file name length is odd, a padding byte is added, making the total length even.\n\nSimilarly for the extra field.\n\nSo, to calculate the correct offset, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, we need to add padding bytes if necessary.\n\nSo, the padded file name length would be fileNameLen rounded up to the next even number. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nWait, but according to the ZIP specification, padding is not required. So why would that be necessary?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name or extra field length is zero, leading to miscalculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when the file name length is zero, the code skips zero bytes, which is correct, but perhaps the extra field is being read incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not correctly handling cases where the extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual extra field is longer, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field includes a 4-byte length header, which is used when the extra field is longer than 0xFF.\n\nBut the code reads the extraFieldLen as a short, which is correct because the extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value. If the extra field is longer than 0xFFFF, it's not handled, but that's a rare case.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the fix. The user suggests that the offset calculation needs to be corrected, taking into account padding bytes.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the offset calculation to include padding bytes after the file name and extra field.\n\nSo, for each of fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, we need to add 1 if the length is odd, to account for padding.\n\nSo, the paddedFileNameLen = fileNameLen + (fileNameLen % 2);\npaddedExtraFieldLen = extraFieldLen + (extraFieldLen % 2);\n\nThen, the dataOffset would be offset + 30 + paddedFileNameLen + paddedExtraFieldLen.\n\nWait, but according to the ZIP spec, padding isn't required. So why would we need to add padding?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding is part of the file name or extra field data. For example, if the file name is stored with a trailing zero to make its length even.\n\nBut again, the ZIP spec doesn't require this.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name is empty (length zero), leading to the offset being miscalculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the extra field is empty.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is correct, but the bug is elsewhere. But according to the user, the issue is in this method.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try to adjust the offset calculation to include padding for the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo, in the code, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, I'll calculate the padded lengths.\n\nint paddedFileNameLen = fileNameLen;\nif (paddedFileNameLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedFileNameLen++;\n}\n\nint paddedExtraFieldLen = extraFieldLen;\nif (paddedExtraFieldLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedExtraFieldLen++;\n}\n\nThen, set dataOffset as offset + 30 + paddedFileNameLen + paddedExtraFieldLen.\n\nBut wait, the current code adds 26 + 2 + 2 = 30, then adds fileNameLen and extraFieldLen. So, to incorporate padding, it would be:\n\noffsetEntry.dataOffset = offset + 30 + paddedFileNameLen + paddedExtraFieldLen;\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the padding is applied to each field individually.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding is applied after each field. So, after the file name, if its length is odd, a padding byte is added. Similarly for the extra field.\n\nSo, the total bytes after the header would be:\n\nfileNameLen + (fileNameLen % 2) + extraFieldLen + (extraFieldLen % 2)\n\nSo, the dataOffset would be offset + 30 + fileNameLen + (fileNameLen % 2) + extraFieldLen + (extraFieldLen % 2).\n\nBut again, I'm not sure if this is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the code is not correctly handling the case where the file name or extra field length is stored as a 2-byte value, but the actual data is longer, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the code is not correctly reading the file name and extra field lengths when they are stored in the data descriptor. But that's a different scenario.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed with the suggested fix, adjusting the offset calculation to account for padding in the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSo, in the code, after reading fileNameLen and extraFieldLen, I'll add padding bytes if necessary.\n\nLet me modify the code accordingly.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\nint fileNameLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\nint extraFieldLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n\nThen, calculate padded lengths:\n\nint paddedFileNameLen = fileNameLen;\nif (paddedFileNameLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedFileNameLen++;\n}\n\nint paddedExtraFieldLen = extraFieldLen;\nif (paddedExtraFieldLen % 2 != 0) {\n    paddedExtraFieldLen++;\n}\n\nThen, skip the file name:\n\nint lenToSkip = paddedFileNameLen;\nwhile (lenToSkip > 0) {\n    int skipped = archive.skipBytes(lenToSkip);\n    if (skipped <= 0) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"failed to skip file name in local file header\");\n    }\n    lenToSkip -= skipped;\n}\n\nWait, no, because the file name is exactly fileNameLen bytes, not padded. So skipping paddedFileNameLen would skip too many bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps the padding is added after the file name, so the code should skip fileNameLen bytes, then skip any padding.\n\nBut how would the code know if padding is present? It can't, unless it's part of the specification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the padding is part of the file name or extra field data, but that's not standard.\n\nI'm getting stuck here.

Upon attempting to extract it with org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile, ZipFile.getInputStream() returns null for ZipArchiveEntries previously retrieved with ZipFile.getEntry() or even ZipFile.getEntries(). See UTF8ZipFilesTest.patch in the attachments for a test case exposing the bug. The original test case stopped short of trying to read the entries, that's why this wasn't flagged up before. \nThe problem lies in the fact that inside ZipFile.java entries are stored in a HashMap. However, at one point after populating the HashMap, the unicode extra fields are read, which leads to a change of the ZipArchiveEntry name, and therefore a change of its hash code. Because of this, subsequent gets on the HashMap fail to retrieve the original values.\nZipFile.patch contains an (admittedly simple-minded) fix for this problem by reconstructing the entries HashMap after the Unicode extra fields have been parsed. The purpose of this patch is mainly to show that the problem is indeed what I think, rather than providing a well-designed solution.\nThe patches have been tested against revision 1210416.\n\n[Trigger Test 1]\nTest Name: testReadWinZipArchive\nTest Source:     public void testReadWinZipArchive() throws IOException, URISyntaxException {\n\n        URL zip = getClass().getResource(\"/utf8-winzip-test.zip\");\n\n        File archive = new File(new URI(zip.toString()));\n\n        ZipFile zf = null;\n\n        try {\n\n            zf = new ZipFile(archive, null, true);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, ASCII_TXT);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, OIL_BARREL_TXT);\n\n        } finally {\n\n            ZipFile.closeQuietly(zf);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nError Message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: InputStream is null\n\tat org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.UTF8ZipFilesTest.assertCanRead(UTF8ZipFilesTest.java:144)  assertNotNull(\"InputStream is null\", is);\n\tat org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.UTF8ZipFilesTest.testReadWinZipArchive(UTF8ZipFilesTest.java:133)  assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT);\n\n[Ground Truth Patch]: private void resolveLocalFileHeaderData(Map<ZipArchiveEntry, NameAndComment>\n                                        entriesWithoutUTF8Flag)\n    throws IOException {\n    // changing the name of a ZipArchiveEntry is going to change\n    // the hashcode -

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** Iterates through the `entries` HashMap's keySet and modifies the `ZipArchiveEntry` keys in place. This causes issues because changing the name of a `ZipArchiveEntry` alters its hashcode, making it unretrievable from the HashMap.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Creates a copy of the `entries` HashMap's keySet (`origMap`), clears the original `entries` map, and then iterates through the copied keySet. For each entry, it processes it and puts the (potentially modified) entry back into the *cleared* `entries` map. This correctly addresses the hashcode issue by rebuilding the map after modifications.\n- **Generated Patch:**  Iterates through the `entries` HashMap's keySet, just like the buggy code. It does *not* address the core HashMap issue. The only change is in the `offsetEntry.dataOffset` calculation, where `LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT` (which is likely 34) is replaced with `30`. This changes the calculated data offset, potentially incorrectly.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The ground truth patch fixes the bug related to Unicode filenames and HashMap retrieval. The generated patch does not fix this bug and introduces a change in offset calculation, which could lead to incorrect data offsets and further issues. Edge cases related to Unicode filenames will still fail in the generated patch, similar to the buggy code.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- This method is `void`, so return values are not directly relevant. However, the side effect is modifying the `entries` HashMap and `nameMap`.\n- **Normal case (valid input):**\n    - Buggy code: Fails for WinZip archives with Unicode extra fields due to HashMap issue. Might work for simple archives without this issue.\n    - Ground truth patch: Works correctly for all valid zip archives, including those with Unicode extra fields.\n    - Generated patch: Still fails for WinZip archives with Unicode extra fields due to the HashMap issue. Might work for simple archives without this issue, but the offset calculation change is concerning.\n- **Missing/null values, Out of bounds values, Invalid inputs:** These are not directly applicable to the core logic of this method, which processes existing entries in the `entries` map. The method relies on the archive being readable and the structure being valid up to this point.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- All three versions have the same error handling: throwing a `RuntimeException` if `archive.skipBytes()` fails to skip the filename in the local file header. There are no significant differences in error handling.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test:**\n    - Buggy code: Fails `testReadWinZipArchive` because `getInputStream()` returns null due to the HashMap retrieval issue.\n    - Ground truth patch: Passes `testReadWinZipArchive` as it correctly handles Unicode filenames and HashMap updates.\n    - Generated patch: Will likely *fail* `testReadWinZipArchive` because it does not address the HashMap issue. The offset calculation change might also cause further issues, but the primary failure will likely be the same as the buggy code.\n- **Other Tests:**\n    - Ground truth patch: Should pass all existing tests and fix the reported bug without introducing regressions.\n    - Generated patch: Might break existing tests due to the incorrect offset calculation. It definitely won't fix the Unicode filename issue and might introduce new problems.\n- **Dependent Code:**\n    - Ground truth patch: Should have minimal impact on dependent code, as it fixes a bug and maintains correct behavior.\n    - Generated patch: Could negatively impact dependent code due to the incorrect offset calculation and the continued presence of the original bug.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Low token similarity (0.08) and overall structure similarity (0.34) between the buggy code and generated patch indicate significant structural differences *from the perspective of token analysis*. However, in this case, the *intended* semantic change is missed by this metric as the core logic of iteration remains the same.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Control flow similarity (1.00) is misleading. While the control flow *structure* might be similar at a high level (loop, conditional), the *semantic effect* of the patches is drastically different.\n- **LLM-based validation:** The LLM assessment is **incorrect** in claiming the generated patch is semantically superior. It seems to have completely missed the core issue and the difference in how the ground truth and generated patches handle the `entries` map. The LLM's reasoning about \"safer and more robust handling of the `entries` map\" for the generated patch is factually wrong; the generated patch does *not* handle the `entries` map in a safer or more robust way compared to the buggy code in relation to the described issue.\n- **Combined assessment:** The combined assessment incorrectly concludes semantic equivalence. This is likely due to the limitations of the automated tools in capturing the nuanced semantic difference related to HashMap key modification and the incorrect LLM assessment.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as **INCORRECT** because:\n\n1. **It fails to address the core bug:** The issue is caused by modifying `ZipArchiveEntry` names (and thus hashcodes) while iterating over the `entries` HashMap's keySet. The generated patch, like the buggy code, iterates directly over `entries.keySet()` and does not implement the crucial step of reconstructing the HashMap as done in the ground truth patch. Therefore, it will still suffer from the same HashMap retrieval issues when processing WinZip archives with Unicode extra fields, and will fail the trigger test `testReadWinZipArchive`.\n\n2. **It introduces an incorrect change in offset calculation:** The generated patch modifies the calculation of `offsetEntry.dataOffset` by replacing `LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT` (likely 34) with `30`. This change is not related to the bug fix and is likely to introduce incorrect data offsets, potentially leading to further issues and breaking existing functionality.\n\n3. **Semantic equivalence tests are misleading:** While some automated tests might suggest similarity in control flow, they fail to capture the critical semantic difference in how the ground truth patch correctly handles the HashMap issue, while the generated patch does not. The LLM assessment is demonstrably wrong in its evaluation of the generated patch.\n\nIn summary, the generated patch not only fails to fix the intended bug but also introduces a potentially harmful change in offset calculation, making it clearly incorrect. It is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch and is detrimental compared to both the buggy code and the ground truth solution.",

The original test case stopped short of trying to read the entries, that's why this wasn't flagged up before. \nThe problem lies in the fact that inside ZipFile.java entries are stored in a HashMap. However, at one point after populating the HashMap, the unicode extra fields are read, which leads to a change of the ZipArchiveEntry name, and therefore a change of its hash code. Because of this, subsequent gets on the HashMap fail to retrieve the original values.\nZipFile.patch contains an (admittedly simple-minded) fix for this problem by reconstructing the entries HashMap after the Unicode extra fields have been parsed. The purpose of this patch is mainly to show that the problem is indeed what I think, rather than providing a well-designed solution.\nThe patches have been tested against revision 1210416.\n\n[Trigger Test 1]\nTest Name: testReadWinZipArchive\nTest Source:     public void testReadWinZipArchive() throws IOException, URISyntaxException {\n\n        URL zip = getClass().getResource(\"/utf8-winzip-test.zip\");\n\n        File archive = new File(new URI(zip.toString()));\n\n        ZipFile zf = null;\n\n        try {\n\n            zf = new ZipFile(archive, null, true);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, ASCII_TXT);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT);\n\n            assertCanRead(zf, OIL_BARREL_TXT);\n\n        } finally {\n\n            ZipFile.closeQuietly(zf);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nError Message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: InputStream is null\n\tat org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.UTF8ZipFilesTest.assertCanRead(UTF8ZipFilesTest.java:144)  assertNotNull(\"InputStream is null\", is);\n\tat org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.UTF8ZipFilesTest.testReadWinZipArchive(UTF8ZipFilesTest.java:133)  assertCanRead(zf, EURO_FOR_DOLLAR_TXT);\n\n[Ground Truth Patch]: private void resolveLocalFileHeaderData(Map<ZipArchiveEntry, NameAndComment>\n                                        entriesWithoutUTF8Flag)\n    throws IOException {\n    // changing the name of a ZipArchiveEntry is going to change\n    // the hashcode - see COMPRESS-164\n    // Map needs to be reconstructed in order to keep central\n    // directory order\n    Map<ZipArchiveEntry, OffsetEntry> origMap =\n        new LinkedHashMap<ZipArchiveEntry, OffsetEntry>(entries);\n    entries.clear();\n    for (ZipArchiveEntry ze : origMap.keySet()) {\n        OffsetEntry offsetEntry = origMap.get(ze);\n        long offset = offsetEntry.headerOffset;\n        archive.seek(offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH);\n        byte[] b = new byte[SHORT];\n        archive.readFully(b);\n        int fileNameLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n        archive.readFully(b);\n        int extraFieldLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n        int lenToSkip = fileNameLen;\n        while (lenToSkip > 0) {\n            int skipped = archive.skipBytes(lenToSkip);\n            if (skipped <= 0) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"failed to skip file name in\"\n                                           + \" local file header\");\n            }\n            lenToSkip -= skipped;\n        }\n        byte[] localExtraData = new byte[extraFieldLen];\n        archive.readFully(localExtraData);\n        ze.setExtra(localExtraData);\n        offsetEntry.dataOffset = offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH\n            + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen;\n\n        if (entriesWithoutUTF8Flag.containsKey(ze)) {\n            String orig = ze.getName();\n            NameAndComment nc = entriesWithoutUTF8Flag.get(ze);\n            ZipUtil.setNameAndCommentFromExtraFields(ze, nc.name,\n                                                     nc.comment);\n            if (!orig.equals(ze.getName())) {\n                nameMap.remove(orig);\n                nameMap.put(ze.getName(), ze);\n            }\n        }\n        entries.put(ze, offsetEntry);\n    }\n}\n[Generated Patch]: private void resolveLocalFileHeaderData(Map<ZipArchiveEntry, NameAndComment> entriesWithoutUTF8Flag)\n    throws IOException {\n    // changing the name of a ZipArchiveEntry is going to change\n    // the hashcode - see COMPRESS-164\n    // Map needs to be reconstructed in order to keep central\n    // directory order\n    for (ZipArchiveEntry ze : entries.keySet()) {\n        OffsetEntry offsetEntry = entries.get(ze);\n        long offset = offsetEntry.headerOffset;\n        archive.seek(offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH);\n        byte[] b = new byte[SHORT];\n        archive.readFully(b);\n        int fileNameLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n        archive.readFully(b);\n        int extraFieldLen = ZipShort.getValue(b);\n        int lenToSkip = fileNameLen;\n        while (lenToSkip > 0) {\n            int skipped = archive.skipBytes(lenToSkip);\n            if (skipped <= 0) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(\"failed to skip file name in\"\n                                           + \" local file header\");\n            }\n            lenToSkip -= skipped;\n        }\n        // Skip padding byte after file name if necessary\n        if (fileNameLen % 2 != 0) {\n            archive.skipBytes(1);\n        }\n        byte[] localExtraData = new byte[extraFieldLen];\n        archive.readFully(localExtraData);\n        // Skip padding byte after extra field if necessary\n        if (extraFieldLen % 2 != 0) {\n            archive.skipBytes(1);\n        }\n        ze.setExtra(localExtraData);\n        // Calculate data offset including padding bytes\n        int paddingFileName = (fileNameLen % 2 == 1) ?

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy code:** Iterates through `entries.keySet()` and retrieves `OffsetEntry` using `entries.get(ze)`. If `ze.getName()` changes within the loop (due to `setNameAndCommentFromExtraFields`), the subsequent `entries.get(ze)` might fail because the hashcode of `ze` has changed, and it might not be found in the `entries` map anymore.\n- **Ground truth patch:** Creates a copy of the `entries` map (`origMap`), clears the original `entries` map, and then iterates through the copied `origMap`. After processing each entry (including potential name change), it explicitly puts the updated `ZipArchiveEntry` and `OffsetEntry` back into the (now cleared and being repopulated) `entries` map. This ensures that the iteration is done on a stable set of keys and the updated entries are correctly placed back in the map.\n- **Generated patch:**  Iterates through `entries.keySet()` just like the buggy code. It adds logic to handle potential padding bytes after the filename and extra field in the local file header. It calculates `dataOffset` considering these padding bytes. However, it does *not* address the core issue of the HashMap key change due to name modification. It still uses the potentially outdated `ze` as a key to access `entries` after `ze.setName()` might have been called.\n- **Behavioral differences:** The ground truth patch correctly addresses the hashmap key issue by reconstructing the map. The generated patch does not address this issue at all. The generated patch introduces padding byte handling, which is not present in the ground truth patch and is not related to the reported bug.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- The function is `void`, so return values are not directly comparable. The key difference is in how the `entries` map is handled internally.\n- **Normal case (valid input):**\n    - Buggy code: Fails when Unicode extra fields cause name changes, leading to lookup failures in the `entries` map.\n    - Ground truth patch: Correctly handles Unicode extra fields and name changes by reconstructing the map, ensuring entries are accessible after name changes.\n    - Generated patch:  Likely to fail in the same scenarios as the buggy code because it doesn't address the hashmap issue. It might handle padding bytes correctly (if the logic is correct), but this is irrelevant to the reported bug.\n- **Missing/null values, Out of bounds values, Invalid inputs:** These are not the primary focus of the bug or the patches. Both patches likely have similar behavior in these edge cases, except for the padding byte handling introduced in the generated patch, which might introduce new edge cases related to archive format if the padding logic is flawed.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Both buggy code and ground truth patch have the same `RuntimeException` for failing to skip file name.\n- Generated patch retains the same exception. It doesn't introduce new error handling related to the core bug fix, but it might introduce new issues if the padding byte skipping logic is incorrect and leads to unexpected archive reading behavior.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger test (testReadWinZipArchive):**\n    - Buggy code: Fails because `getInputStream()` returns null due to the hashmap issue.\n    - Ground truth patch: Should pass the trigger test as it fixes the hashmap issue.\n    - Generated patch: Likely to fail the trigger test because it does not address the hashmap issue, which is the root cause of the test failure.\n- **Potential issues with other tests:**\n    - Ground truth patch: Should be safe and not introduce regressions as it directly addresses the reported bug.\n    - Generated patch: Might introduce regressions if the padding byte handling is incorrect or incomplete, although it's unlikely to cause major issues as it's a relatively isolated change. However, it definitely doesn't fix the reported bug.\n- **Behavior changes affecting dependent code:**\n    - Ground truth patch: Fixes the bug without introducing unintended behavioral changes. It makes the code work as expected in scenarios with Unicode extra fields.\n    - Generated patch: Introduces padding byte handling, which is a behavioral change, although it's likely intended to improve robustness in handling different zip file formats. However, it doesn't fix the reported bug and might be an incorrect or incomplete fix for padding issues (if padding was even an issue in the first place - the issue description doesn't mention padding).\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Low token and structure similarity (0.06, 0.25) indicates significant structural differences, which is expected as the generated patch adds padding logic, while the ground truth patch restructures the map handling.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Control flow similarity (0.86) is relatively high, but this might be misleading as both patches iterate through entries. The core logic difference (map reconstruction vs. padding) is not well captured by simple control flow similarity.\n- **LLM-based validation:** LLM correctly identifies non-equivalence (0.0 confidence) and points out the difference in padding byte handling and `dataOffset` calculation.\n- **Combined assessment:**  Confirms that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth with high confidence (0.70).\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as INCORRECT because it fails to address the core bug described in the issue, which is the HashMap key change problem caused by modifying `ZipArchiveEntry` names after they are used as keys in the `entries` map. The ground truth patch correctly fixes this by reconstructing the `entries` map. In contrast, the generated patch introduces unrelated logic for handling padding bytes in the local file header and calculating `dataOffset` based on padding. This padding logic is not mentioned in the bug report or issue description and does not resolve the reported problem of `getInputStream()` returning null for WinZip archives with Unicode extra fields.  The generated patch will likely still fail the trigger test `testReadWinZipArchive` because it does not fix the hashmap issue. Semantic equivalence tests also confirm that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch. Therefore, the generated patch is not a correct solution to the reported bug.",
