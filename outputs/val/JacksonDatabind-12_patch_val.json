      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** The buggy code's `isCachable()` method incorrectly determines if a deserializer can be cached by only checking `_valueTypeDeserializer` and `_ignorableProperties`. It misses the crucial check for `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`, which are relevant when custom deserializers are used as highlighted in the issue description and comments. This leads to incorrect caching decisions when custom deserializers are involved, causing the reported bug.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch correctly expands the `isCachable()` method to include checks for `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer` in addition to `_valueTypeDeserializer` and `_ignorableProperties`. This ensures that caching is disabled if any of these deserializers are present, aligning with the intended behavior to prevent issues with custom deserializers.\n- **Generated Patch:** The generated patch attempts to address the issue by introducing a new method `hasCustomDeserializer()` and calling it within `isCachable()`. It retains the checks for `_valueTypeDeserializer` and `_ignorableProperties`. The intention seems to be to encapsulate the logic for checking custom deserializers within `hasCustomDeserializer()`. However, the provided code snippet lacks the implementation of `hasCustomDeserializer()`, making it impossible to definitively assess its behavior without assuming its implementation.  If `hasCustomDeserializer()` correctly checks for the presence of `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`, then it could potentially achieve the same outcome as the ground truth patch.  If it does not, or if it checks for something else, the behavior will differ.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- In scenarios where custom deserializers (`_valueDeserializer` or `_keyDeserializer`) are present, the buggy code might incorrectly return `true` (cachable) because it doesn't check these fields. The ground truth patch and the generated patch (assuming `hasCustomDeserializer()` correctly checks for custom deserializers) should return `false` (not cachable) in such cases.\n- In normal cases without custom deserializers, all three versions should ideally return `true` (cachable), assuming `_ignorableProperties` and `_valueTypeDeserializer` are also null.\n- The key difference lies in how they handle the presence of `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`. The buggy code ignores them, the ground truth patch explicitly checks them, and the generated patch delegates this check to `hasCustomDeserializer()`.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- The `isCachable()` method itself is not directly involved in error handling. It's a boolean function determining cachability based on internal state. Error handling is not a differentiating factor here.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test:** The buggy code will fail the trigger test because it incorrectly caches the deserializer, leading to the custom deserializer not being applied as expected in all scenarios. The ground truth patch is designed to fix this and will pass the trigger test. The generated patch's ability to pass the trigger test depends entirely on the implementation of `hasCustomDeserializer()`. If `hasCustomDeserializer()` correctly identifies the presence of custom deserializers that should prevent caching (specifically `_valueDeserializer` or `_keyDeserializer`), then it will likely pass the trigger test.\n- **Other Tests:** The ground truth patch is expected to be the most robust fix as it directly addresses the identified issue by explicitly checking all relevant conditions for cachability. The generated patch's impact on other tests is uncertain without knowing the implementation of `hasCustomDeserializer()`. If `hasCustomDeserializer()` introduces any unintended side effects or incomplete checks, it could potentially cause issues in other tests, although in this specific context, it's less likely.\n- **Dependent Code:** Both patches aim to correct the caching logic. The ground truth patch does so by directly expanding the condition. The generated patch does so by introducing a method. Both should improve correctness related to custom deserializers. The generated patch might be slightly less performant due to the added method call, but this is likely negligible.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** The low AST similarity scores reflect the structural difference introduced by the generated patch (adding a new method and method call).\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** The control flow similarity of 0.75 indicates some difference in control flow, which is expected due to the added method call.\n- **LLM-based validation:** The LLM correctly points out that the ground truth patch directly addresses the issue by explicitly checking `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`, aligning directly with the comment's intention. The LLM assessment suggests that the generated patch is less directly aligned, which is true as it introduces an abstraction (`hasCustomDeserializer()`) instead of directly expanding the condition. The confidence score of 0.67 for non-equivalence is reasonable given the structural and conceptual differences.\n\n[Classification]\nPLAUSIBLE\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as PLAUSIBLE because it attempts to address the core issue by introducing a `hasCustomDeserializer()` method, which *could* be implemented to correctly check for the conditions that should prevent caching (specifically the presence of `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`). If `hasCustomDeserializer()` is implemented correctly to mirror the checks added in the ground truth patch, then the generated patch would likely fix the bug and pass the trigger test.\n\nHowever, without the actual implementation of `hasCustomDeserializer()`, it's impossible to definitively classify it as CORRECT. The generated patch introduces a level of indirection that is not present in the ground truth patch, making it slightly less transparent and potentially more prone to implementation errors in `hasCustomDeserializer()`. The semantic equivalence tests also indicate that it is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth with reasonable confidence.\n\nTherefore, while the generated patch shows a plausible approach to fixing the bug, its correctness is contingent on the correct implementation of the `hasCustomDeserializer()` method, and it is not as direct and clearly correct as the ground truth patch. It is also structurally different and less semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch. Hence, PLAUSIBLE is the most appropriate classification.",

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:**  The buggy code incorrectly caches deserializers if only `_valueTypeDeserializer` is null, ignoring `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`. This leads to the issue where custom deserializers are incorrectly reused for different properties.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** This patch correctly checks all three conditions: `_valueDeserializer`, `_keyDeserializer`, and `_valueTypeDeserializer`. If any of these are not null (meaning a custom deserializer is present), it prevents caching. This is the correct fix.\n- **Generated Patch:** This patch checks `_keyDeserializer` and `_valueTypeDeserializer`, but misses the check for `_valueDeserializer`.  This means it will still incorrectly cache deserializers in cases where only a custom `_valueDeserializer` is present, which is the exact scenario described in the bug report and trigger test.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The ground truth patch is the most restrictive, correctly preventing caching in all scenarios where custom deserializers are involved. The generated patch is less restrictive than the ground truth, and still incorrectly allows caching in some cases, specifically when a custom value deserializer is used but no custom key or value type deserializer is present.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- In the normal case (no custom deserializers), all patches and the buggy code will return `true` (cacheable).\n- When a custom value deserializer is present (as in the trigger test):\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `true` (incorrectly cacheable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cacheable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `true` (incorrectly cacheable).\n- When a custom key deserializer is present:\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `true` (incorrectly cacheable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cacheable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cacheable).\n- When a custom value type deserializer is present:\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `false` (correctly not cacheable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cacheable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cacheable).\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- No error handling is involved in this method.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test:** The trigger test `testCustomMapValueDeser735` will **fail** with both the buggy code and the generated patch. The error message \"expected:<1> but was:<100>\" clearly indicates that the custom deserializer is incorrectly applied to `map2` because of incorrect caching. The ground truth patch will **pass** the trigger test.\n- **Other Tests:** The generated patch is likely to cause similar failures in other tests that rely on correct deserializer caching behavior when custom value deserializers are used. The ground truth patch is less likely to cause such issues.\n\n5.

The trigger test specifically highlights the problem with custom *value* deserializers. The generated patch, by omitting the check for `_valueDeserializer`, still incorrectly caches deserializers when a custom value deserializer is used. This leads to the custom deserializer being incorrectly applied to other properties that should use the default deserializer, as evidenced by the failing trigger test.  While the generated patch is an improvement over the original buggy code by including the check for `_keyDeserializer`, it is not a complete or correct fix for the reported bug and fails the provided trigger test.

They either seemed to stop working or were active on the wrong fields.\nI could narrow it down to some change in version 2.4.4 (2.4.3 is still working for me)\nI wrote a test to show this behavior. It seems to appear when there a two maps with the same key and value types in a bean, and only one of them has a custom deserializer. The deserializer is then falsely used either for both or none of the maps.\nThis test works for me in version 2.4.3 and fails with higher versions.\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.annotation.JsonDeserialize;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.StdDeserializer;\n\npublic class DeserializeTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testIt() throws Exception {\n        ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();\n        String json = \"{\\\"map1\\\":{\\\"a\\\":1},\\\"map2\\\":{\\\"a\\\":1}}\";\n        TestBean bean = om.readValue(json.getBytes(), TestBean.class);\n\n        assertEquals(100, bean.getMap1().get(\"a\").intValue());\n        assertEquals(1, bean.getMap2().get(\"a\").intValue());\n    }\n\n    public static class TestBean {\n\n        @JsonProperty(\"map1\")\n        @JsonDeserialize(contentUsing = CustomDeserializer.class)\n        Map<String, Integer> map1;\n\n        @JsonProperty(\"map2\")\n        Map<String, Integer> map2;\n\n        public Map<String, Integer> getMap1() {\n            return map1;\n        }\n\n        public void setMap1(Map<String, Integer> map1) {\n            this.map1 = map1;\n        }\n\n        public Map<String, Integer> getMap2() {\n            return map2;\n        }\n\n        public void setMap2(Map<String, Integer> map2) {\n            this.map2 = map2;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static class CustomDeserializer extends StdDeserializer<Integer> {\n\n        public CustomDeserializer() {\n            super(Integer.class);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Integer deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {\n            Integer value = p.readValueAs(Integer.class);\n            return value * 100;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n[Trigger Test 1]\nTest Name: testCustomMapValueDeser735\nTest Source:     public void testCustomMapValueDeser735() throws Exception {\n\n        String json = \"{\\\"map1\\\":{\\\"a\\\":1},\\\"map2\\\":{\\\"a\\\":1}}\";\n\n        TestMapBean735 bean = MAPPER.readValue(json, TestMapBean735.class);\n\n\n\n        assertEquals(100, bean.map1.get(\"a\").intValue());\n\n        assertEquals(1, bean.map2.get(\"a\").intValue());\n\n    }\n\nError Message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<1> but was:<100>\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.TestCustomDeserializers.testCustomMapValueDeser735(TestCustomDeserializers.java:370)  assertEquals(1, bean.map2.get(\"a\").intValue());\n\n[Ground Truth Patch]: public boolean isCachable() {\n    /* As per [databind#735], existence of value or key deserializer (only passed\n     * if annotated to use non-standard one) should also prevent caching.\n     */\n    return (_valueDeserializer == null)\n            && (_keyDeserializer == null)\n            && (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)\n            && (_ignorableProperties == null);\n}\n[Generated Patch]: public boolean isCachable() {\n    /* [databind#735] Caching should be prevented if any custom deserializer is present */\n    return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)\n            && (_keyDeserializer == null)\n            && (_ignorableProperties == null);\n}\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation using token analysis: Token similarity: 0.69, Method signature similarity: 0.50, Variable usage similarity: 0.00.

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** Caching is enabled if `_valueTypeDeserializer` and `_ignorableProperties` are null. This is incorrect as it should also consider `_valueDeserializer` and `_keyDeserializer`.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Caching is disabled if `_valueDeserializer`, `_keyDeserializer`, `_valueTypeDeserializer`, or `_ignorableProperties` are not null. This correctly addresses the issue by considering all relevant deserializer types.\n- **Generated Patch:** Caching is disabled if `_keyDeserializer`, `_valueTypeDeserializer`, or `_ignorableProperties` are not null. It adds the check for `_keyDeserializer` but *removes* the implicit check for `_valueDeserializer` that was intended (but incorrectly implemented as `_valueTypeDeserializer` check in buggy code). It still misses the crucial check for `_valueDeserializer`.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The generated patch is better than the buggy code by considering `_keyDeserializer`, but it is still incomplete compared to the ground truth patch because it misses the `_valueDeserializer` check. In scenarios where only `_valueDeserializer` is present, the generated patch will incorrectly allow caching, while the ground truth patch will correctly disable it.\n- **Edge Cases:** The key edge case is when a class has a custom `_valueDeserializer` but not a `_keyDeserializer` or `_valueTypeDeserializer`. The generated patch will fail to prevent caching in this case, leading to the bug described in the issue.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (no custom deserializers):** All three versions (buggy, ground truth, generated) will return `true` (cachable).\n- **`_valueDeserializer` is not null:**\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `true` (incorrectly cachable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `true` (incorrectly cachable).\n- **`_keyDeserializer` is not null:**\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `true` (incorrectly cachable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n- **`_valueTypeDeserializer` is not null:**\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n- **`_ignorableProperties` is not null:**\n    - Buggy Code: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n    - Generated Patch: Returns `false` (correctly not cachable).\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Not applicable for this method.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test:** The trigger test `testCustomMapValueDeser735` will **fail** with the generated patch. This is because the test case relies on a custom `contentUsing` deserializer, which corresponds to `_valueDeserializer`. Since the generated patch does not check `_valueDeserializer`, it will incorrectly cache the deserializer and apply the custom deserializer to both maps, leading to the assertion failure. The ground truth patch will pass the trigger test.\n- **Other Tests:**  The generated patch might pass some tests that the buggy code also passes, but it will likely fail tests that specifically check for correct handling of custom `_valueDeserializer`s in caching scenarios.\n- **Dependent Code:** Dependent code might still experience the bug with the generated patch in scenarios involving custom `_valueDeserializer`s.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- The semantic equivalence testing results are misleading and inaccurate. The LLM assessment incorrectly claims the generated patch adds a check for `_valueDeserializer`. The combined assessment of semantic equivalence is also incorrect. My analysis clearly shows that the generated patch is NOT semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch and is functionally flawed.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch is classified as **INCORRECT** because it fails to fully address the bug described in the issue and demonstrated by the trigger test. While it improves upon the buggy code by adding a check for `_keyDeserializer`, it crucially omits the check for `_valueDeserializer`. This omission means that in scenarios where a custom `_valueDeserializer` is present (as is the case in the trigger test), the generated patch will still incorrectly enable caching. Consequently, the trigger test `testCustomMapValueDeser735` will likely fail with the generated patch, as it will exhibit the same incorrect behavior as the original buggy code in the specific scenario highlighted by the issue. The generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch and does not provide a complete and correct fix for the identified bug.",
