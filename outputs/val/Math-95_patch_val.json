Core Functionality and Behavior\n- Buggy code calculates `d / (d - 2.0)` unconditionally, leading to division by zero and `POSITIVE_INFINITY` when `d = 2.0`.\n- Ground truth patch returns `1.0` if `d <= 2.0` and `d / (d - 2.0)` if `d > 2.0`. It uses a fixed value `1.0` for problematic cases.\n- Generated patch returns `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` if `d == 2.0` and `d / (d - 2.0)` otherwise. It handles `d = 2.0` specifically but still returns `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.\n- Behavioral differences:\n    - When `d = 2.0`: Buggy and Generated patch return `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, Ground truth returns `1.0`.\n    - When `d < 2.0`: Buggy and Generated patch return negative values from `d / (d - 2.0)`, Ground truth returns `1.0`.\n    - When `d > 2.0`: All patches return `d / (d - 2.0)`.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- Normal case (`d > 2.0`): All patches return `d / (d - 2.0)`.\n- Edge case (`d = 2.0`): Buggy: `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, Ground truth: `1.0`, Generated: `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.\n- Edge case (`d < 2.0`, e.g., `d = 1.0`): Buggy: `-1.0`, Ground truth: `1.0`, Generated: `-1.0`.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Buggy code: Implicitly leads to `POSITIVE_INFINITY` which causes `IllegalArgumentException` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket`.\n- Ground truth patch: Avoids the error by returning a fixed value `1.0` for `d <= 2.0`.\n- Generated patch: Explicitly returns `POSITIVE_INFINITY` for `d = 2.0`, which is likely to still cause the same `IllegalArgumentException` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket`.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- Trigger test: The trigger test fails in buggy code due to `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.\n- Ground truth patch: Should pass the trigger test as it returns `1.0` for `d = 2.0`, a valid initial value.\n- Generated patch: Likely to fail the trigger test. While it avoids division by zero, `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is likely still an invalid initial value for `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket`, as indicated by the original issue description and error message context.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- Semantic equivalence tests confirm that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth. LLM specifically points out the behavioral difference for `d <= 2.0`.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch, while addressing the division-by-zero issue for `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom = 2.0`, replaces it with `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.  Returning `POSITIVE_INFINITY` as the initial domain value is likely to still cause the same `IllegalArgumentException` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` as observed in the original bug report, because `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is not a valid finite endpoint for bracketing. The ground truth patch correctly resolves the issue by returning a bounded value of `1.0` when `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is less than or equal to `2.0`, ensuring a valid initial domain for the bracketing process.  Furthermore, the generated patch and ground truth exhibit different behavior for `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom < 2.0`, where the ground truth returns `1.0` and the generated patch returns negative values, further highlighting the semantic difference. The semantic equivalence tests also support the conclusion that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth. Therefore, the generated patch is classified as INCORRECT because it is unlikely to fully resolve the bug and is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch.",

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:**  Calculates `ret = d / (d - 2.0)` unconditionally. When `d = 2.0`, this results in division by zero and `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:**  If `d > 2.0`, calculates `ret = d / (d - 2.0)`. Otherwise (`d <= 2.0`), sets `ret = 1.0`. This avoids division by zero and sets a default value for small `d`.\n- **Generated Patch:** If `abs(d - 2.0) < 1e-6` (approximately `d = 2.0`), calculates `ret = d / (d - 1.0)`. Otherwise, calculates `ret = d / (d - 2.0)`. This also avoids division by zero when `d` is close to 2.0, but uses a different formula `d / (d - 1.0)` in this case.\n\n- **Behavioral Differences:**\n    - For `d = 2.0`:\n        - Buggy: `POSITIVE_INFINITY`\n        - Ground Truth: `1.0`\n        - Generated: `2.0 / (2.0 - 1.0) = 2.0`\n    - For `d = 1.0`:\n        - Buggy: `1.0 / (1.0 - 2.0) = -1.0`\n        - Ground Truth: `1.0`\n        - Generated: `1.0 / (1.0 - 2.0) = -1.0`\n    - For `d = 3.0`:\n        - Buggy: `3.0 / (3.0 - 2.0) = 3.0`\n        - Ground Truth: `3.0 / (3.0 - 2.0) = 3.0`\n        - Generated: `3.0 / (3.0 - 2.0) = 3.0`\n\n- **Edge Cases:**\n    - `d = 2.0` is the main edge case causing the bug. Both patches handle this case, but differently.\n    - `d < 2.0`: Ground truth sets a constant `1.0`, while the generated patch still calculates `d / (d - 2.0)` (unless `d` is very close to 2.0).\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input, e.g., d = 3.0):** All three versions return the same value (`3.0`).\n- **Missing/null values (d is not explicitly set, defaults to some value):** Assuming `d` is always a valid double from `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()`, this is not directly applicable.\n- **Out of bounds values (d = 2.0):**\n    - Buggy: `POSITIVE_INFINITY`\n    - Ground Truth: `1.0`\n    - Generated: `2.0`\n- **Invalid inputs (d < 0, though degrees of freedom should be positive):**  The behavior for `d < 0` is not explicitly handled in any patch, and the original formula `d / (d - 2.0)` would still be calculated in buggy and generated patches. Ground truth patch would return `1.0` for `d <= 2.0`, including negative values.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- The buggy code does not have explicit error handling for `d = 2.0`. It leads to a runtime exception indirectly in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` due to `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.\n- Both patches avoid the division by zero, thus preventing the original error.\n- Neither patch introduces new explicit error handling.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Will patch pass the trigger test?** Yes, both ground truth and generated patches should pass the trigger test because they prevent `POSITIVE_INFINITY` when `d = 2.0`, resolving the `IllegalArgumentException`.\n- **Are there potential issues with other tests?**  The generated patch changes the return value for `d` close to 2.0 to `2.0`, while the ground truth patch sets it to `1.0` for `d <= 2.0`. This behavioral difference *could* potentially affect other tests that rely on the specific return value of `getInitialDomain` for small degrees of freedom. However, without knowing the broader test suite, it's hard to say definitively.\n- **Could behavior changes affect dependent code?** Yes, the different return values for `d` around 2.0 could affect dependent code that uses the `FDistributionImpl` and relies on the `getInitialDomain` method. The ground truth patch's behavior of returning `1.0` for `d <= 2.0` might be a more conservative or intended behavior than the generated patch's `2.0` for `d ~= 2.0`.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **AST-based validation:** Low token similarity (0.17) and overall structure similarity (0.45) indicate structural differences, which is expected as the patches introduce conditional logic.\n- **Symbolic execution validation:** Control flow similarity (0.83) suggests some overlap in control flow, but also differences due to the added conditional logic.\n- **LLM-based validation:**  Low LLM assessed equivalence (0.1) with high confidence (1.0) strongly suggests that the LLM considers the patches semantically different, highlighting the different behavior for `d` around 2.0. The LLM's specific comment about different behavior for `d ~= 2.0` reinforces this.\n- **Combined assessment:** The combined assessment correctly concludes that the patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth with 0.70 confidence, aligning with the detailed analysis.\n\n[Classification]\nPLAUSIBLE\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch successfully addresses the division-by-zero error for `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom = 2.0`, resolving the bug reported in the issue and likely passing the trigger test. However, it exhibits behavioral differences compared to the ground truth patch.  Specifically, for `d` approximately equal to 2.0, the generated patch returns `2.0` by using the formula `d / (d - 1.0)`, while the ground truth patch returns `1.0` for all `d <= 2.0`. This difference in return values, especially for small degrees of freedom, indicates that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth. While it fixes the immediate bug, the different behavior makes it only PLAUSIBLE rather than CORRECT. The ground truth patch's approach of returning a constant `1.0` for `d <= 2.0` might be more aligned with the intended behavior or mathematical properties of the `getInitialDomain` method in the context of CDF root finding, which is not fully captured by the generated patch.",

Everything is working fine and the\nresults are matching our reference calculations.\nHowever, the FDistribution behaves strange if a\ndenominatorDegreeOfFreedom of 2 is used, with an alpha-value of 0.95.\nThis results in an IllegalArgumentsException, stating:\nInvalid endpoint parameters:  lowerBound=0.0 initial=Infinity\nupperBound=1.7976931348623157E308\ncoming from\norg.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket\nThe problem is the 'initial' parameter to that function, wich is\nPOSITIVE_INFINITY and therefore not within the boundaries. I already\npinned down the problem to the FDistributions getInitialDomain()-method,\nwich goes like:\n        return getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() /\n                    (getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom() - 2.0);\nObviously, in case of denominatorDegreesOfFreedom == 2, this must lead\nto a division-by-zero, resulting in POSTIVE_INFINITY. The result of this\noperation is then directly passed into the\nUnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket() - method as second argument.\n\n[Trigger Test 1]\nTest Name: testSmallDegreesOfFreedom\nTest Source:     public void testSmallDegreesOfFreedom() throws Exception {\n\n        org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl fd =\n\n            new org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl(\n\n                1.0, 1.0);\n\n        double p = fd.cumulativeProbability(0.975);\n\n        double x = fd.inverseCumulativeProbability(p);\n\n        assertEquals(0.975, x, 1.0e-5);\n\n\n\n        fd.setDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom(2.0);\n\n        p = fd.cumulativeProbability(0.975);\n\n        x = fd.inverseCumulativeProbability(p);\n\n        assertEquals(0.975, x, 1.0e-5);\n\n    }\n\nError Message: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid endpoint parameters:  lowerBound=0.0 initial=-1.0 upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308\n\tat org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealSolverUtils.java:179)  throw new IllegalArgumentException\n\tat org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealSolverUtils.java:128)  return bracket( function, initial, lowerBound, upperBound,            Integer.MAX_VALUE ) ;\n\tat org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability(AbstractContinuousDistribution.java:84)  bracket = UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(                    rootFindingFunction, getInitialDomain(p),                    lowerBound, upperBound);\n\tat org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability(FDistributionImpl.java:106)  return super.inverseCumulativeProbability(p);\n\tat org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest.testSmallDegreesOfFreedom(FDistributionTest.java:114)  double x = fd.inverseCumulativeProbability(p);\n\n[Ground Truth Patch]: protected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret = 1.0;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    if (d > 2.0) {\n        // use mean\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n[Generated Patch]: protected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    double tolerance = 1e-6;\n    ret = d / (d - 2.0 + tolerance);\n    return ret;\n}\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation using token analysis: Token similarity: 0.24, Method signature similarity: 1.00, Variable usage similarity: 0.33.

      "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- Buggy code calculates `d / (d - 2.0)` unconditionally, leading to division by zero when `d=2`.\n- Ground truth patch returns a fixed value `1.0` when `d <= 2.0` and calculates `d / (d - 2.0)` when `d > 2.0`. This avoids division by zero and provides a bounded initial domain for small `d`.\n- Generated patch calculates `d / (d - 2.0 + tolerance)`. This avoids division by zero but still results in large values (positive or negative) when `d` is close to 2.0. It doesn't bound the initial domain for small `d` in the same way as the ground truth.\n\n- Behavioral differences:\n    - For `d = 2.0`: Buggy: `Infinity`, Ground truth: `1.0`, Generated: large positive value.\n    - For `d < 2.0`: Buggy: negative value, Ground truth: `1.0`, Generated: negative value (magnitude might differ).\n    - For `d > 2.0`: All patches are similar, but generated patch will be slightly different due to the `tolerance`.\n\n- Edge cases:\n    - `d = 2.0`: Buggy code fails, ground truth and generated patch avoid failure but with different return values.\n    - `d` close to 2.0: Generated patch can produce very large positive or negative values, unlike ground truth which is bounded.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- Normal case (d > 2.0): All patches return values close to `d / (d - 2.0)`.\n- Missing/null values: Not applicable as `d` is derived from `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom()`.\n- Out of bounds values (d <= 0): `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is likely expected to be positive, but if it's <= 0, buggy and generated patch might have issues (division by negative or near zero), ground truth will return 1.0.\n- Invalid inputs (non-numeric): Not applicable as `d` is double.\n\n| Scenario | Buggy Code | Ground Truth Patch | Generated Patch |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| d = 3.0 | 3.0 | 3.0 | ~3.0 |\n| d = 2.0 | Infinity | 1.0 | Large positive |\n| d = 1.0 | -1.0 | 1.0 | ~-1.0 |\n| d = 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | ~0.0 |\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Buggy code: No explicit error handling, leads to `IllegalArgumentException` in calling method due to `Infinity`.\n- Ground truth patch: Implicitly handles the problematic case by returning a fixed value.\n- Generated patch: Avoids `Infinity` but doesn't fundamentally change error handling strategy.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- Trigger test: Buggy code fails due to `Infinity`. Ground truth and generated patch will likely pass as they avoid `Infinity`.\n- Other tests: Ground truth patch is less likely to cause issues in other tests as it provides a bounded and reasonable initial domain. Generated patch might still lead to unexpected behavior in edge cases where a bounded initial domain is expected, due to potentially large positive or negative values.\n- Dependent code: Code dependent on `getInitialDomain` might expect a more stable and bounded value, which ground truth provides better than generated patch.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- AST, symbolic execution, and LLM-based validation all indicate that the generated patch is NOT semantically equivalent to the ground truth. LLM specifically highlights differences for `d <= 2.0`. The low similarity scores support this conclusion.\n\n[Classification]\nPLAUSIBLE\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch addresses the division-by-zero error in the buggy code, which is the core issue reported in the bug description and demonstrated by the trigger test. By adding a tolerance, it prevents the method from returning `Infinity` when `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is 2.0, and thus likely resolves the `IllegalArgumentException` in `UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket`.\n\nHowever, the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch. The ground truth patch provides a more robust fix by returning a constant value of `1.0` when `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is less than or equal to 2.0. This ensures a bounded and predictable initial domain value in these edge cases. The generated patch, while avoiding division by zero, still produces potentially large (positive or negative) and unbounded values when `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom` is close to 2.0, and negative values when it's less than 2.0. This behavioral difference, especially for small values of `denominatorDegreesOfFreedom`, makes the generated patch not semantically equivalent to the ground truth.\n\nDespite the semantic differences, the generated patch is still considered **PLAUSIBLE** because it fixes the immediate crash and might be sufficient to pass the trigger test. It's a less ideal solution compared to the ground truth, but it addresses the most critical aspect of the bug. It's not classified as CORRECT because it's not semantically equivalent, and not INCORRECT because it does fix the division-by-zero problem.",
