The function `reparseCentralDirectoryData` is used to parse the raw bytes read from the central directory extra field with knowledge of which fields are expected to be there. The function takes four boolean parameters indicating whether certain fields are present in the central directory. It then checks if the length of the raw central directory data matches the expected length based on the presence of these fields. If the lengths do not match, it throws a `ZipException`. The trigger test `testExcessDataInZip64ExtraField` tests this function by reading a zip file and checking the size of a specific entry. The error message indicates that the expected length of the central directory data is 16, but the actual length is 28.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of this bug is that the function `reparseCentralDirectoryData` does not correctly handle the case where the raw central directory data contains excess data beyond what is expected.
