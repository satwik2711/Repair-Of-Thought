The error message indicates that the expected string representation is not equal to the actual one. Specifically, the expected string includes all properties (`a1` to `a6`), while the actual string only includes the first four properties and an ellipsis (`...`). This suggests that the issue lies in the `toStringHelper` method, which is responsible for generating the string representation of the record type.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The `toStringHelper` method has a bug in its logic for handling the `prettyPrint` flag.

However, the current implementation only includes the first `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` properties and appends an ellipsis (`...`) if there are more properties.
