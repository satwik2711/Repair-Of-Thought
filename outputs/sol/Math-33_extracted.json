    "The bug is caused by the incorrect removal of columns from the tableau in the `dropPhase1Objective` method. Specifically, the method removes the columns corresponding to the non-basic artificial variables, but it does not update the `columnLabels` list correctly. This leads to an incorrect solution being returned by the `SimplexSolver`.": [
      "Update Column Labels Correctly\nWe can update the `columnLabels` list by removing the labels corresponding to the columns that are being removed from the tableau. We can do this by iterating over the `columnsToDrop` list and removing the corresponding labels from the `columnLabels` list. Here is the corrected code:\n```java\nfor (int i = columnsToDrop.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    int col = columnsToDrop.get(i);\n    columnLabels.remove(col);\n}\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient approach.",
      "Use a More Efficient Data Structure\nInstead of using an `ArrayList` to store the `columnLabels`, we can use a more efficient data structure such as a `HashMap` or a `TreeMap`. This would allow us to remove labels more efficiently and avoid the need to iterate over the entire list. Here is an example of how we can use a `HashMap` to store the `columnLabels`:\n```java\nprivate Map<Integer, String> columnLabels = new HashMap<>();\n\n// ...\n\nfor (int i = columnsToDrop.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    int col = columnsToDrop.get(i);\n    columnLabels.remove(col);\n}\n```\nThis solution is more efficient than the first one, but it requires more changes to the existing code.",
      "Reorder Columns Before Removing\nAnother approach is to reorder the columns before removing them from the tableau. We can do this by creating a new `Array2DRowRealMatrix` with the columns in the correct order, and then removing the columns that are no longer needed. Here is an example of how we can do this:\n```java\ndouble[][] matrix = new double[getHeight() - 1][getWidth() - columnsToDrop.size()];\nint col = 0;\nfor (int j = 0; j < getWidth(); j++) {\n    if (!columnsToDrop.contains(j)) {\n        for (int i = 1; i < getHeight(); i++) {\n            matrix[i - 1][col] = tableau.getEntry(i, j);\n        }\n        col++;\n    }\n}\nthis.tableau = new Array2DRowRealMatrix(matrix);\n```\nThis solution is more complex than the first two, but it avoids the need to update the `columnLabels` list."
