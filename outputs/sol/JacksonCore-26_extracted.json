    "The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the `_currInputRowStart` variable in the `feedInput` function. When the input is fed in chunks, the `_currInputRowStart` variable is not updated correctly, leading to an incorrect calculation of the byte offset.": [
      "Update `_currInputRowStart` Based on Previous Input\nOne possible fix is to update the `_currInputRowStart` variable based on the previous input. We can do this by keeping track of the previous input end index and using it to calculate the new `_currInputRowStart` value. The corrected code would be:\n```java\n// Keep track of the previous input end index\nint previousInputEnd = _inputEnd;\n\n// Update _currInputRowStart based on previous input\n_currInputRowStart = start - (previousInputEnd - _currInputRowStart);\n```\nThis fix ensures that the `_currInputRowStart` variable is updated correctly even when the input is fed in chunks.",
      "Reset `_currInputRowStart` When Input is Fed in Chunks\nAnother possible fix is to reset the `_currInputRowStart` variable to the start index of the new input chunk. This will ensure that the byte offset is calculated correctly even when the input is fed in chunks. The corrected code would be:\n```java\n// Reset _currInputRowStart when input is fed in chunks\nif (start < previousInputEnd) {\n    _currInputRowStart = start;\n}\n```\nThis fix is simpler than the first one, but it may not work correctly in all scenarios.",
      "Update `_currInputProcessed` to Account for Chunked Input\nA third possible fix is to update the `_currInputProcessed` variable to account for the chunked input. We can do this by adding the length of the previous input chunk to the `_currInputProcessed` value. The corrected code would be:\n```java\n// Update _currInputProcessed to account for chunked input\n_currInputProcessed += previousInputEnd - start;\n```\nThis fix ensures that the `_currInputProcessed` variable is updated correctly even when the input is fed in chunks. However, it may not directly fix the issue with the `_currInputRowStart` variable."
