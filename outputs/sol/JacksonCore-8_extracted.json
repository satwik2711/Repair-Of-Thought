    "The root cause of the bug is that the `_resultArray` field is being set to null when `contentsAsString` is called, and then `getTextBuffer` is called again. This is because `contentsAsString` likely sets `_resultString` to null, which in turn sets `_resultArray` to null when `getTextBuffer` is called. This is a problem because the method is trying to return the length of `_resultArray`, which is now null.": [
      "Check for Null Before Returning\nWe can add a null check before returning `_resultArray` in `getTextBuffer`. If `_resultArray` is null, we can return an empty array or throw an exception, depending on the desired behavior. This is a simple and straightforward fix that ensures the method returns a non-null value even if `_resultArray` is null. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] getTextBuffer()\n{\n    // ... (rest of the method remains the same)\n    if (_resultArray != null) return _resultArray;\n    return new char[0]; // return an empty array if _resultArray is null\n}\n```",
      "Avoid Setting _resultArray to Null\nWe can modify `contentsAsString` to not set `_resultString` to null, or to set `_resultArray` to a non-null value when `_resultString` is set to null. This would ensure that `_resultArray` is always non-null when `getTextBuffer` is called. However, this fix requires modifying the `contentsAsString` method, which may have unintended consequences.",
      "Use a Local Variable\nWe can modify `getTextBuffer` to use a local variable to store the result of `_resultString.toCharArray()`, rather than assigning it to `_resultArray`. This would ensure that `_resultArray` is not modified when `contentsAsString` is called. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] getTextBuffer()\n{\n    // ... (rest of the method remains the same)\n    if (_resultString != null) {\n        char[] result = _resultString.toCharArray();\n        return result;\n    }\n    // ... (rest of the method remains the same)\n}\n```"
