This would prevent the exception from being thrown and allow the `areEqual` function to continue executing. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean areEqual(Object o1, Object o2) {\n    if (o1 == null || o2 == null) {\n        return o1 == null && o2 == null;\n    } else if (isArray(o1)) {\n        return isArray(o2) && areArraysEqual(o1, o2);\n    } else {\n        try {\n            return o1.equals(o2);\n        } catch (RuntimeException e) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 2: Use instanceof to Check for BadEquals\nAnother possible solution is to use the `instanceof` operator to check if the objects being compared are instances of the `BadEquals` class. If they are, we can return false immediately without calling the `equals` method. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean areEqual(Object o1, Object o2) {\n    if (o1 == null || o2 == null) {\n        return o1 == null && o2 == null;\n    } else if (isArray(o1)) {\n        return isArray(o2) && areArraysEqual(o1, o2);\n    } else if (o1 instanceof BadEquals || o2 instanceof BadEquals) {\n        return false;\n    } else {\n        return o1.equals(o2);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Implement a Custom Equality Check\nA third possible solution is to implement a custom equality check for objects of type `BadEquals`. This could involve comparing the fields of the objects directly, rather than relying on the `equals` method. However, this solution would require knowledge of the internal structure of the `BadEquals` class, which may not be feasible. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\npublic static boolean areEqual(Object o1, Object o2) {\n    if (o1 == null || o2 == null) {\n        return o1 == null && o2 == null;\n    } else if (isArray(o1)) {\n        return isArray(o2) && areArraysEqual(o1, o2);\n    } else if (o1 instanceof BadEquals && o2 instanceof BadEquals) {\n        BadEquals b1 = (BadEquals) o1;\n        BadEquals b2 = (BadEquals) o2;\n        // Compare the fields of b1 and b2 directly\n        // ...\n        return true; // or false\n    } else {\n        return o1.equals(o2);\n    }\n}\n```",
