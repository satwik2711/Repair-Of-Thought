    "The root cause of the bug is in the way the distances are calculated and used to choose the initial cluster centers. In the K-means++ algorithm, the distance between each point and the nearest already chosen center is calculated, and the point with the maximum distance is chosen as the next center. However, in this implementation, the distances are calculated as the sum of the squared distances, which can lead to incorrect results when the distances are very small, as in the case of the testSmallDistances test.": [
      "Use the Maximum Distance Instead of the Sum of Squared Distances\nInstead of calculating the sum of the squared distances, we can calculate the maximum distance between each point and the nearest already chosen center. This will ensure that the point with the maximum distance is chosen as the next center. We can modify the code as follows:\n```java\n// For each data point x, compute D(x), the distance between x and\n// the nearest center that has already been chosen.\ndouble maxDistance = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < pointSet.size(); i++) {\n    final T p = pointSet.get(i);\n    final Cluster<T> nearest = getNearestCluster(resultSet, p);\n    final double d = p.distanceFrom(nearest.getCenter());\n    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, d);\n    dx2[i] = maxDistance;\n}\n```",
      "Add a Small Value to the Distances\nWe can add a small value to the distances to avoid the issue of very small distances. This will ensure that the point with the maximum distance is chosen as the next center. We can modify the code as follows:\n```java\n// For each data point x, compute D(x), the distance between x and\n// the nearest center that has already been chosen.\ndouble sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < pointSet.size(); i++) {\n    final T p = pointSet.get(i);\n    final Cluster<T> nearest = getNearestCluster(resultSet, p);\n    final double d = p.distanceFrom(nearest.getCenter()) + 1e-6; // add a small value\n    sum += d * d;\n    dx2[i] = sum;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Distance Metric\nWe can consider using a different distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance, instead of the sum of squared distances. This may help to avoid the issue of very small distances. We can modify the code as follows:\n```java\n// For each data point x, compute D(x), the distance between x and\n// the nearest center that has already been chosen.\ndouble sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < pointSet.size(); i++) {\n    final T p = pointSet.get(i);\n    final Cluster<T> nearest = getNearestCluster(resultSet, p);\n    final double d = Math.sqrt(p.distanceFrom(nearest.getCenter())); // use Euclidean distance\n    sum += d;\n    dx2[i] = sum;\n}\n```"
