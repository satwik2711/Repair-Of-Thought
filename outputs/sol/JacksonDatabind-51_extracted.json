    "The root cause of the bug is that the `_findDeserializer` function is not correctly handling the deserialization of polymorphic types. Specifically, when the type ID is not found in the `_deserializers` map, the function tries to find a default implementation or a contextual value deserializer. However, in this case, the default implementation is not suitable for the polymorphic type, and the contextual value deserializer is not correctly configured to handle the type.": [
      "Use a More Specific Type Resolver\nOne possible fix is to use a more specific type resolver that can correctly handle the polymorphic type. For example, we could use a type resolver that is specifically designed for handling polymorphic types, such as the `PolymorphicTypeResolver` class. This would require modifying the `_findDeserializer` function to use the new type resolver. Specifically, we could add a check to see if the type ID is a polymorphic type, and if so, use the `PolymorphicTypeResolver` to resolve the type.\n\n```java\nif (typeId.startsWith(\"@\")) {\n    // Use PolymorphicTypeResolver to resolve the type\n    JavaType type = _polymorphicTypeResolver.typeFromId(ctxt, typeId);\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Default Implementation\nAnother possible fix is to modify the default implementation of the deserializer to correctly handle the polymorphic type. For example, we could modify the `_findDefaultImplDeserializer` function to return a deserializer that is specifically designed for handling polymorphic types. This would require modifying the `_findDeserializer` function to use the new default implementation. Specifically, we could add a check to see if the type ID is a polymorphic type, and if so, use the new default implementation.\n\n```java\nif (typeId.startsWith(\"@\")) {\n    // Use a deserializer specifically designed for polymorphic types\n    JsonDeserializer<Object> deser = _findPolymorphicDeserializer(ctxt, typeId);\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Configure the Contextual Value Deserializer\nA third possible fix is to configure the contextual value deserializer to correctly handle the polymorphic type.

This would require modifying the `_findDeserializer` function to use the new contextual value deserializer.
