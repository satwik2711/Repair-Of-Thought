    "The root cause of this bug is that the CholeskyDecompositionImpl function does not correctly check if the matrix is positive definite. The function checks if the diagonal elements are greater than the absolutePositivityThreshold, but it does not check if the matrix is positive definite after the transformation. The transformation can make the matrix not positive definite even if the original matrix is positive definite.": [
      "Check Positive Definiteness After Transformation\nWe can add a check after the transformation to ensure that the matrix is positive definite. We can use the Sylvester's criterion to check if the matrix is positive definite. If the matrix is not positive definite, we can throw a NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException. This can be done by adding a loop after the transformation to check the diagonal elements of the transformed matrix.\n\n```java\n// transform the matrix\nfor (int i = 0; i < order; ++i) {\n\n    final double[] ltI = lTData[i];\n\n    // check diagonal element\n\n    ltI[i] = Math.sqrt(ltI[i]);\n    final double inverse = 1.0 / ltI[i];\n\n    for (int q = order - 1; q > i; --q) {\n        ltI[q] *= inverse;\n        final double[] ltQ = lTData[q];\n        for (int p = q; p < order; ++p) {\n            ltQ[p] -= ltI[q] * ltI[p];\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n// check if the matrix is positive definite after transformation\nfor (int i = 0; i < order; ++i) {\n    final double[] ltI = lTData[i];\n    if (ltI[i] < absolutePositivityThreshold) {\n        throw new NotPositiveDefiniteMatrixException();\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Method for Cholesky Decomposition\nWe can use a more robust method for Cholesky decomposition, such as the LDL decomposition or the Bunch-Kaufman decomposition. These methods are more robust and can handle matrices that are not positive definite. This would require replacing the existing Cholesky decomposition algorithm with a new one.\n\n```java\n// transform the matrix using LDL decomposition\nfor (int i = 0; i < order; ++i) {\n\n    final double[] ltI = lTData[i];\n\n    // calculate the diagonal element\n\n    final double diagonal = Math.sqrt(ltI[i]);\n    ltI[i] = diagonal;\n\n    // calculate the off-diagonal elements\n\n    for (int j = i + 1; j < order; ++j) {\n        final double[] ltJ = lTData[j];\n        ltJ[i] /= diagonal;\n    }\n\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Transformation to Preserve Positive Definiteness\nWe can modify the transformation to preserve the positive definiteness of the matrix. We can use a modified version of the Cholesky decomposition that preserves the positive definiteness of the matrix. This would require modifying the existing Cholesky decomposition algorithm to preserve the positive definiteness of the matrix.\n\n```java\n// transform the matrix while preserving positive definiteness\nfor (int i = 0; i < order; ++i) {\n\n    final double[] ltI = lTData[i];\n\n    // calculate the diagonal element while preserving positive definiteness\n\n    final double diagonal = Math.max(Math.sqrt(ltI[i]), absolutePositivityThreshold);\n    ltI[i] = diagonal;\n\n    // calculate the off-diagonal elements while preserving positive definiteness\n\n    for (int j = i + 1; j < order; ++j) {\n        final double[] ltJ = lTData[j];\n        ltJ[i] /= diagonal;\n    }\n\n}\n```"
