        "reasoning_steps": "Step 1: Response\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Bug Context\",\n    \"content\": \"First, let's understand the buggy function and its intended behavior. The function is designed to find two values a and b that bracket a root of a given function. It starts with an initial midpoint and expands the interval until it finds a and b that satisfy the condition f(a) * f(b) <= 0. The function also checks for convergence and throws an exception if it fails to find a and b within the specified maximum iterations. The trigger test is testing the inverse cumulative probability of a normal distribution, which calls the buggy function. However, the error message is not provided, so we will assume that the test is failing due to the function not being able to bracket the root correctly.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is in the do-while loop condition.
