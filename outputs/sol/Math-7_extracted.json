    "The bug is caused by the fact that the `evaluateStep` method in the `EventState` class is not properly synchronized with the `acceptStep` method in the `AbstractIntegrator` class. Specifically, the `evaluateStep` method is called multiple times with the same interpolator, which can lead to inconsistent results. This is because the `acceptStep` method modifies the interpolator's state, but the `evaluateStep` method does not take this into account.": [
      "Synchronize `evaluateStep` with `acceptStep`\nOne possible fix is to synchronize the `evaluateStep` method with the `acceptStep` method. This can be done by adding a lock to the `EventState` class and acquiring this lock in both the `evaluateStep` and `acceptStep` methods. This will ensure that the `evaluateStep` method is not called while the `acceptStep` method is modifying the interpolator's state.\n\n```java\npublic class EventState {\n    private final Object lock = new Object();\n\n    public boolean evaluateStep(AbstractStepInterpolator interpolator) {\n        synchronized (lock) {\n            // existing code\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class AbstractIntegrator {\n    public double acceptStep(AbstractStepInterpolator interpolator, double[] y, double[] yDot, double tEnd) {\n        synchronized (interpolator.getEventState().lock) {\n            // existing code\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Use a Thread-Safe Interpolator\nAnother possible fix is to use a thread-safe interpolator. This can be done by creating a new interpolator class that is designed to be thread-safe. This class can use a lock to synchronize access to its state, ensuring that the `evaluateStep` method is not called while the `acceptStep` method is modifying the interpolator's state.\n\n```java\npublic class ThreadSafeInterpolator extends AbstractStepInterpolator {\n    private final Object lock = new Object();\n\n    public void setSoftPreviousTime(double previousTime) {\n        synchronized (lock) {\n            // existing code\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void setSoftCurrentTime(double currentTime) {\n        synchronized (lock) {\n            // existing code\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Avoid Modifying the Interpolator's State\nA third possible fix is to avoid modifying the interpolator's state in the `acceptStep` method. Instead, the `acceptStep` method can create a new interpolator object that represents the updated state. This new interpolator object can then be passed to the `evaluateStep` method, ensuring that the `evaluateStep` method is not called with an inconsistent interpolator state.\n\n```java\npublic class AbstractIntegrator {\n    public double acceptStep(AbstractStepInterpolator interpolator, double[] y, double[] yDot, double tEnd) {\n        AbstractStepInterpolator newInterpolator = new AbstractStepInterpolator();\n        // update newInterpolator's state\n        // pass newInterpolator to evaluateStep\n    }\n}\n```"
