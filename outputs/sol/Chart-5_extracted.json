    "The bug occurs because when the series is set to auto-sort and does not allow duplicate x-values, adding a new data point with an x-value that already exists in the series causes the indexOf(x) method to return the index of the existing data point. If the series is empty or the new data point's x-value is not found, the indexOf(x) method returns -1, which is then used as an index to add a new data point. However, in the case where the series has only one element and the new data point has the same x-value as the existing one, the indexOf(x) method returns 0, and -index - 1 becomes -1, which is an invalid index for adding a new data point to the list, resulting in the IndexOutOfBoundsException.": [
      "Check for Duplicate X-Values Before Index Calculation\nWhen the series does not allow duplicate x-values and is set to auto-sort, before calculating the index to add a new data point, check if the x-value already exists in the series. If it does, update the existing data point instead of trying to add a new one. This approach ensures that the method handles duplicate x-values correctly and avoids the IndexOutOfBoundsException.",
      "Handle Index Calculation for Auto-Sort\nModify the index calculation when the series is set to auto-sort to correctly handle the case where the new data point's x-value is the same as an existing one. Instead of using -index - 1 directly, ensure that the index is valid for the current state of the series. This can be achieved by checking if the index is -1 and handling this case separately, for example, by appending the new data point to the end of the series if it is empty or if the x-value is not found.",
      "Adjust Addition Logic Based on Series State\nChange the logic for adding new data points based on whether the series is empty, has one element, or has multiple elements, and whether the new data point's x-value is the same as an existing one. This will ensure that the addOrUpdate method correctly handles all scenarios without resulting in an IndexOutOfBoundsException. For instance, if the series has only one element and the new data point has the same x-value, update the existing data point; otherwise, add the new data point at the correct index based on the series' auto-sort setting."
