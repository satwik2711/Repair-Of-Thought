    "The root cause of the bug is that the `indexOf` method returns a negative index when the series is sorted and the x-value is not found in the series. This negative index is then used to insert the new item into the series, which causes the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. The issue arises because the `indexOf` method returns the index where the item should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, but this index is not valid when the series is already sorted and the x-value is not found.": [
      "Handle Negative Index\nWe can modify the code to handle the case where the `indexOf` method returns a negative index. We can use the `Math.abs` function to get the absolute value of the index, which will give us the correct index to insert the new item into the series. However, this approach is incorrect as it will insert the item at the wrong position in the sorted series. Instead, we should use the absolute value of the index minus 1 to get the correct position. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (this.autoSort) {\n    int absIndex = Math.abs(index) - 1;\n    this.data.add(absIndex, new XYDataItem(x, y));\n}\n```\nThis fix will ensure that the new item is inserted at the correct index in the series, even when the `indexOf` method returns a negative index.",
      "Use Binary Search\nAnother approach is to use a binary search algorithm to find the correct index to insert the new item into the series. We can use the `Collections.binarySearch` method to find the index where the item should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. However, this method also returns a negative index if the item is not found, so we need to handle this case correctly. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (this.autoSort) {\n    int index = Collections.binarySearch(this.data, new XYDataItem(x, y));\n    if (index < 0) {\n        index = -index - 1;\n    }\n    this.data.add(index, new XYDataItem(x, y));\n}\n```\nThis fix will ensure that the new item is inserted at the correct index in the series, even when the `indexOf` method returns a negative index.",
      "Check for Duplicate X-Values and Insert at Correct Position\nWe can also modify the code to check if the x-value is already present in the series before trying to insert the new item. If the x-value is already present, we can update the existing item instead of trying to insert a new item. If the x-value is not present, we can insert the new item at the correct position in the sorted series. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (this.autoSort) {\n    int index = indexOf(x);\n    if (index >= 0) {\n        XYDataItem existing = (XYDataItem) this.data.get(index);\n        existing.setY(y);\n    } else {\n        index = -index - 1;\n        this.data.add(index, new XYDataItem(x, y));\n    }\n}\n```\nThis fix will ensure that the series does not contain duplicate x-values, and will prevent the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` from being thrown."
