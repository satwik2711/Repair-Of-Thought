The Rotation class is designed to build a rotation that transforms a pair of vectors into another pair. The buggy function takes four vectors as input: u1, u2, v1, and v2. The function normalizes v1 and adjusts v2 to ensure that the angular separation between u1 and u2 is the same as the angular separation between v1 and v2. The function then computes the rotation using the normalized vectors. The trigger test case provides specific values for u1, u2, v1, and v2, and the expected output is a rotation with specific quaternion values. However, the actual output is NaN (Not a Number), indicating a numerical issue.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is the division by zero in the computation of the scalar part of the quaternion.
