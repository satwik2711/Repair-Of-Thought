We can check if the first child of the GETPROP node is a NAME node with the string value 'Math', and if the last child is a STRING node with a value that is a method of the Math namespace. If both conditions are true, we can return false, indicating that the function call has no side effects.",

We can add an additional check to see if the first child of the GETPROP node is a NAME node and the last child is a STRING node. If both conditions are true, we can check if the string value of the last child is a method of the Math namespace. If it is, we can return false, indicating that the function call has no side effects.",

We can then modify the existing logic to check if the function call is in this new set. If it is, we can return false, indicating that the function call has no side effects.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
