    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `translate()` does not correctly handle surrogate pairs in the input. When a surrogate pair is encountered, the function increments the position `pos` by the number of characters in the current code point, but it does not account for the fact that the surrogate pair is represented by two 16-bit code units. This causes the position `pos` to be incremented beyond the end of the input string, resulting in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.": [
      "Increment Position by 2 for Surrogate Pairs\nOne potential fix is to increment the position `pos` by 2 when a surrogate pair is encountered. This would ensure that the position `pos` is correctly incremented, even when the input contains surrogate pairs. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (Character.isSurrogatePair(input.charAt(pos), input.charAt(pos + 1))) {\n    pos += 2;\n} else {\n    pos += Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n}\n```\nThis fix is the most straightforward and efficient way to correctly handle surrogate pairs in the input.",
      "Use `Character.codePoints()` Instead of `Character.codePointAt()`\nAnother potential fix is to use the `Character.codePoints()` method instead of `Character.codePointAt()`. The `codePoints()` method returns an IntStream of Unicode code points, which would allow us to correctly handle surrogate pairs in the input. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nint[] codePoints = input.codePoints().toArray();\nfor (int codePoint : codePoints) {\n    // process the code point\n}\n```\nThis fix would require significant changes to the existing code, but it would provide a more robust and flexible way to handle Unicode code points.",
      "Check for Surrogate Pairs Before Incrementing Position\nA third potential fix is to check for surrogate pairs before incrementing the position `pos`. This would ensure that the position `pos` is not incremented beyond the end of the input string. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (pos + 1 < len && Character.isSurrogatePair(input.charAt(pos), input.charAt(pos + 1))) {\n    pos += 2;\n} else {\n    pos += Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n}\n```\nThis fix is similar to Suggestion 1, but it provides an additional check to ensure that the position `pos` is not incremented beyond the end of the input string."
