    "The root cause of the bug is that the `anyOtherEndTag` function is not correctly handling the case sensitivity of the HTML tags. The function is using the `equals` method to compare the tag names, which is case sensitive. However, the HTML parser is configured to preserve the case of the tags, which means that the tag names may not match exactly. This is causing the parser to incorrectly handle the end tags, resulting in an incorrect parse tree.": [
      "Use Case-Insensitive Comparison\nUse the `equalsIgnoreCase` method instead of `equals` to compare the tag names. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, which should fix the bug. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (node.nodeName().equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, and it should fix the bug without introducing additional complexity or performance issues.",
      "Normalize Tag Names\nNormalize the tag names to a standard case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, which should fix the bug. The modified code would be:\n```java\nString nodeName = node.nodeName().toLowerCase();\nString name = t.asEndTag().normalName().toLowerCase();\nif (nodeName.equals(name)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution requires additional processing to normalize the tag names, but it provides a more robust solution that handles non-standard tag names.",
      "Use a Case-Insensitive Map\nUse a case-insensitive map to store the tag names, which will allow for case-insensitive lookups. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, which should fix the bug. The modified code would be:\n```java\nMap<String, Element> tagMap = new TreeMap<String, Element>(String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\n// ...\nif (tagMap.containsKey(name)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution requires additional memory and complexity to store the tag names in a map, but it provides a more efficient solution that handles large numbers of tags."
