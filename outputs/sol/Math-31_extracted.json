    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to the inaccurate results from the continued fraction calculation. The continued fraction calculation is sensitive to the values of the parameters, and the large number of degrees of freedom in the F-distribution may be causing the calculation to diverge or produce inaccurate results.": [
      "Increase the Maximum Number of Iterations\nOne potential fix is to increase the maximum number of iterations in the evaluate method. This may allow the algorithm to converge to a more accurate result. However, this may also increase the computational time. To implement this fix, we can modify the maxIterations parameter in the evaluate method to a larger value, such as 1000 or 2000.",
      "Use a More Robust Algorithm\nAnother potential fix is to use a more robust algorithm for computing the continued fraction. For example, we could use the Steed's algorithm, which is more robust than the modified Lentz algorithm. However, this may also increase the computational time. To implement this fix, we can replace the modified Lentz algorithm with the Steed's algorithm in the evaluate method.",
      "Use a Different Scaling Factor\nA third potential fix is to use a different scaling factor in the evaluate method. The current scaling factor is based on the maximum of the absolute values of the parameters. However, this may not be the best scaling factor for the F-distribution. We could try using a different scaling factor, such as the geometric mean of the parameters. To implement this fix, we can modify the scaling factor calculation in the evaluate method to use the geometric mean of the parameters."
