The `_verifySharing` function seems to be responsible for verifying and updating the sharing status of certain data structures. The trigger test `testSymbolTableExpansionBytes` is designed to test the expansion of the symbol table when dealing with bytes. The error message indicates an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access an index in the `_hashArea` array.
