Here is an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // Create a graph to keep track of the inheritance chain\n  Graph<JSType> graph = new Graph<>();\n  // ...\n  if (graph.hasCycle()) {\n    return errorReporter.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is more complex, but it may be more efficient and scalable.\n\nSuggestion 3: Modify the Function handleTypeCycle\nWe can modify the function handleTypeCycle to prevent cycles from causing errors.

Here is an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nvoid handleTypeCycle(ErrorReporter t) {\n  // Instead of throwing an exception, return an error message\n  t.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple, but it may not be the most effective way to handle cycles, as it does not prevent the cycle from causing an error.",
