    "The findAliases function is not correctly handling the case where a variable is assigned a value that is not a qualified name. In the current implementation, the function only checks if the parent node is a variable and if the child node is a qualified name. However, this does not cover the case where a variable is assigned a value that is not a qualified name, but is still a non-alias local.": [
      "Add Additional Check for Non-Alias Locals\nOne possible fix is to add an additional check in the findAliases function to handle the case where a variable is assigned a value that is not a qualified name. This can be done by checking if the child node is a variable and if its parent node is not a function. If this condition is met, the function can report a non-alias local error. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (parent.isVar() && n.hasChildren() && !n.getFirstChild().isQualifiedName()) {\n    report(t, n, GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL, n.getString());\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Condition for Reporting Non-Alias Locals\nAnother possible fix is to modify the condition for reporting non-alias locals. Instead of checking if the parent node is a variable and if the child node is a qualified name, the function can check if the child node is a variable and if its parent node is not a function. This will ensure that non-alias locals are correctly reported. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (n.hasChildren() && n.getFirstChild().isVar() && !n.getParent().isFunction()) {\n    report(t, n, GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL, n.getString());\n}\n```",
      "Add a Separate Check for Function Declarations\nA third possible fix is to add a separate check for function declarations. In the current implementation, function declarations are not correctly handled. By adding a separate check for function declarations, the function can correctly report non-alias locals in this case. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (n.isFunction()) {\n    report(t, n, GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL, n.getString());\n}\n```"
