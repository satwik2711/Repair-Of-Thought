The `stop()` method is supposed to stop the stopwatch and allow the time to be retrieved. However, the trigger test `testLang315()` is failing with an `AssertionFailedError` when asserting that the suspend time is equal to the total time. This indicates that the `stop()` method is not correctly calculating the total time.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `stopTime` is being set to the current time when the `stop()` method is called, instead of calculating the total time elapsed since the stopwatch was started.

Then, in the `stop()` method, calculate the total time elapsed by subtracting the `startTime` from the current time.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Stopwatch Implementation with Automatic Time Calculation\nConsider using a `StopWatch` implementation that automatically calculates the total time elapsed, such as the `java.time.Duration` class. This would eliminate the need to manually calculate the total time elapsed in the `stop()` method.\n\nSuggestion 3: Update the `stop()` Method to Account for Suspended Time\nUpdate the `stop()` method to account for the time that the stopwatch was suspended. This can be done by adding a `suspendedTime` field to the `StopWatch` class and incrementing it by the time that the stopwatch was suspended.
