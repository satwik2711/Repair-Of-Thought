    "The root cause of the bug is that the `prelim` function throws a `PathIsExploredException` when the number of additional interpolation points is greater than 47. This exception is thrown because the algorithm encounters a problem with the interpolation points, specifically when the `ipt` and `jpt` indices are swapped. This swapping is done to ensure that the function value at the first interpolation point contributes to the off-diagonal second derivative terms of the initial quadratic model. However, this swapping can cause problems when the number of additional interpolation points is large.": [
      "Fix the Index Swapping\nOne possible solution to this bug is to fix the index swapping in the `prelim` function. Instead of swapping the `ipt` and `jpt` indices, we can use a different approach to ensure that the function value at the first interpolation point contributes to the off-diagonal second derivative terms of the initial quadratic model. For example, we can use a temporary variable to store the value of `ipt` and then use this variable to compute the off-diagonal second derivative terms. This can be achieved by modifying the code as follows:\n```java\nif (ipt > n) {\n    final int tmp2 = jpt;\n    jpt = ipt - n;\n    ipt = tmp2;\n    // Remove the throw statement here\n    // throw new PathIsExploredException(); // XXX\n}\n```",
      "Increase the Hard Limit\nAnother possible solution to this bug is to increase the hard limit on the number of additional interpolation points. The current hard limit is set to 47, but we can increase this limit to allow for more interpolation points. However, this solution may not be feasible if the number of additional interpolation points is very large, as it may cause performance issues. This can be achieved by modifying the code as follows:\n```java\nfinal int maxAdditionalPoints = 100; // Increase the hard limit\n```",
      "Use a Different Approach for Computing Off-Diagonal Second Derivative Terms\nA third possible solution to this bug is to use a different approach for computing the off-diagonal second derivative terms of the initial quadratic model. Instead of using the `ipt` and `jpt` indices, we can use a different method to compute these terms. For example, we can use a loop to iterate over the interpolation points and compute the off-diagonal second derivative terms directly. This can be achieved by modifying the code as follows:\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < npt; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j < npt; j++) {\n        if (i != j) {\n            // Compute the off-diagonal second derivative terms directly\n            modelSecondDerivativesValues.setEntry(i * (npt - 1) + j, \n                (fAtInterpolationPoints.getEntry(i) - fAtInterpolationPoints.getEntry(j)) / \n                (interpolationPoints.getEntry(i, 0) - interpolationPoints.getEntry(j, 0)));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"
