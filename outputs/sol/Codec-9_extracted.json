    "The root cause of the bug is that the `getEncodeLength` function is not taking into account the `isChunked` parameter when calculating the length of the encoded data. This results in an incorrect calculation of the maximum result size when `isChunked` is `false`. The `getEncodeLength` function assumes that the data will always be chunked, which is not the case when `isChunked` is `false`.": [
      "Modify getEncodeLength to Consider isChunked\nWe can modify the `getEncodeLength` function to use a different calculation when `isChunked` is `false`. For example, we can use the `MIME_CHUNK_SIZE` constant only when `isChunked` is `true`, and use a different constant or calculation when `isChunked` is `false`. This will ensure that the correct maximum result size is calculated in both cases.",
      "Use a Different Calculation for getEncodeLength\nAlternatively, we can modify the `getEncodeLength` function to use a different calculation that takes into account the `isChunked` parameter. For example, we can use a calculation that is based on the length of the input data and the chunk size, but also considers the `isChunked` parameter. This will ensure that the correct maximum result size is calculated in both cases.",
      "Add a Special Case for isChunked = false\nWe can add a special case to the `getEncodeLength` function to handle the case where `isChunked` is `false`. In this case, we can use a different calculation or constant to determine the maximum result size. For example, we can use the following calculation: `len = (binaryData.length + 2) / 3 * 4;` when `isChunked` is `false`. This will ensure that the correct maximum result size is calculated when `isChunked` is `false`."
