    "The root cause of the bug is that the Fraction class is not correctly handling integer overflow scenarios. The issue arises when the value passed to the constructor is very large, causing the variables p2 and q2 to overflow. The current implementation checks for overflow after the variables have been updated, which is too late. The check should be done before updating the variables to prevent overflow.": [
      "Check for Overflow Before Updating Variables\nOne possible fix is to check for overflow before updating the variables p2 and q2. This can be done by checking if the product of a1 and p1 (or q1) would exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a long variable. If it would, then an exception should be thrown immediately. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif ((a1 * p1) > overflow || (a1 * q1) > overflow) {\n    throw new FractionConversionException(value, p2, q2);\n}\np2 = (a1 * p1) + p0;\nq2 = (a1 * q1) + q0;\n```",
      "Use a Larger Data Type\nAnother possible fix is to use a larger data type, such as BigInteger, to store the variables p2 and q2. This would prevent overflow from occurring, but it would also increase the memory usage of the class. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nBigInteger p2 = BigInteger.valueOf(a1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(p1)).add(BigInteger.valueOf(p0));\nBigInteger q2 = BigInteger.valueOf(a1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(q1)).add(BigInteger.valueOf(q0));\n```",
      "Reduce the Value of maxDenominator\nA third possible fix is to reduce the value of maxDenominator. This would prevent the variables p2 and q2 from growing too large and overflowing. However, this would also reduce the accuracy of the fraction. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nint maxDenominator = 1000000; // reduce the value of maxDenominator\n```"
