    "The root cause of the bug is that the processProperties function does not correctly handle options with empty string values. When the value of an option is an empty string, the function should not add the option to the CommandLine. However, the current implementation does not check for this case, leading to the assertion failure in the trigger test.": [
      "Add Empty String Check\nAdd a check for empty string values before adding the option to the CommandLine. This can be done by adding a simple if statement to check if the value is an empty string. If it is, the function should not add the option to the CommandLine. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (!opt.hasArg() && (value == null || value.isEmpty())) {\n    continue;\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that options with empty string values are not added to the CommandLine, fixing the bug.",
      "Modify Option Addition Logic\nModify the logic for adding options to the CommandLine. Instead of adding the option if its value is not 'yes', 'true', or '1', add the option only if its value is not an empty string. This will ensure that options with empty string values are not added to the CommandLine. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (!opt.hasArg() && !value.isEmpty()) {\n    cmd.addOption(opt);\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that options with empty string values are not added to the CommandLine, fixing the bug.",
      "Use a More Robust Option Addition Logic\nUse a more robust logic for adding options to the CommandLine. Instead of checking for specific values, use a regular expression to check if the value matches a valid option value. This will ensure that options with invalid values, including empty strings, are not added to the CommandLine. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (!opt.hasArg() && value.matches(\"[a-zA-Z0-9]+\")) {\n    cmd.addOption(opt);\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that options with invalid values, including empty strings, are not added to the CommandLine, fixing the bug."
