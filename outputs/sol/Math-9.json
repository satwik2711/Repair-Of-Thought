The `revert` function is supposed to return a new instance of the `Line` class with the direction reversed. The trigger test creates a `Line` object with a specific direction, reverses it using the `revert` function, and then asserts that the direction of the reversed line is the negation of the original direction. However, the test fails with an `Assert.assertArrayEquals` error, indicating that the directions do not match.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue lies in the way the `revert` function calculates the new direction. The `zero.subtract(direction)` expression is subtracting the direction vector from the zero vector, which is not equivalent to negating the direction vector. This is because subtracting a vector from the zero vector does not change its magnitude, only its direction.
