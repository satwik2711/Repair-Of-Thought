    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to the calculation of the p-value in the `getCorrelationPValues` function. The function uses the `TDistribution` class to calculate the cumulative probability, but it does not handle the case where the correlation coefficient is very close to 1. In this case, the calculation of `t` becomes very large, causing the `cumulativeProbability` method to return a value very close to 1, resulting in a p-value of zero.": [
      "Use a More Robust Calculation Method\nOne possible fix is to use a more robust calculation method for the p-value, such as the `log` method provided by the `TDistribution` class. This method is more accurate for large values of `t`. We can modify the `getCorrelationPValues` function to use this method instead of the `cumulativeProbability` method. The modified code snippet would be:\n```java\ndouble t = Math.abs(r * Math.sqrt((nObs - 2)/(1 - r * r)));\nout[i][j] = 2 * Math.exp(tDistribution.logCumulativeProbability(t));\n```\nThis approach is more accurate and efficient, as it avoids the potential overflow issue with the `cumulativeProbability` method.",
      "Add a Special Case for High Correlation Coefficients\nAnother possible fix is to add a special case for high correlation coefficients. We can check if the correlation coefficient is very close to 1 and return a small non-zero value for the p-value in this case. This will prevent the `cumulativeProbability` method from returning a value very close to 1. The modified code snippet would be:\n```java\nif (Math.abs(r) > 0.999) {\n    out[i][j] = 1e-10; // return a small non-zero value\n} else {\n    double t = Math.abs(r * Math.sqrt((nObs - 2)/(1 - r * r)));\n    out[i][j] = 2 * (1 - tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(t));\n}\n```\nThis approach is simple and effective, but it may not be as accurate as the first suggestion.",
      "Use a Different Distribution for High Correlation Coefficients\nA third possible fix is to use a different distribution for high correlation coefficients. For example, we can use the `NormalDistribution` class instead of the `TDistribution` class when the correlation coefficient is very close to 1. This will provide a more accurate calculation of the p-value in this case. The modified code snippet would be:\n```java\nif (Math.abs(r) > 0.999) {\n    NormalDistribution normalDistribution = new NormalDistribution(0, 1);\n    double t = Math.abs(r * Math.sqrt((nObs - 2)/(1 - r * r)));\n    out[i][j] = 2 * (1 - normalDistribution.cumulativeProbability(t));\n} else {\n    double t = Math.abs(r * Math.sqrt((nObs - 2)/(1 - r * r)));\n    out[i][j] = 2 * (1 - tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(t));\n}\n```\nThis approach is more accurate than the second suggestion, but it may be less efficient due to the additional calculation required."
