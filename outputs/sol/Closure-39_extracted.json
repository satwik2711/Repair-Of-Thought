    "The `toStringHelper` method has a bug in its logic for handling the `prettyPrint` flag. When `prettyPrint` is true, the method is supposed to include all properties in the string representation. However, the current implementation only includes the first `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` properties and appends an ellipsis (`...`) if there are more properties. This is incorrect because the `prettyPrint` flag is supposed to override the default behavior of truncating the string representation.": [
      "Remove the Ellipsis\nThe first suggestion is to remove the ellipsis (`...`) when `prettyPrint` is true. This can be done by removing the line `sb.append(\", ...\");` and the corresponding `if` statement. This fix ensures that all properties are included in the string representation when `prettyPrint` is true.",
      "Increase the MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES\nThe second suggestion is to increase the value of `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` to a larger number, such as 100. This would ensure that more properties are included in the string representation, even when `prettyPrint` is false. However, this fix may not be suitable if the number of properties is very large, as it could lead to performance issues.",
      "Remove the MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES Limitation\nThe third suggestion is to remove the limitation imposed by `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES` when `prettyPrint` is true. This can be done by removing the `if` statement that checks if `i` is equal to `MAX_PRETTY_PRINTED_PROPERTIES`. This fix ensures that all properties are included in the string representation when `prettyPrint` is true, without any limitations."
