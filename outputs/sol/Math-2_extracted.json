    "The issue lies in the getNumericalMean() function, which calculates the mean of the Hypergeometric distribution. The function uses the formula (n * m) / N, but it does not handle the case where the result is negative due to integer overflow. Since the variables n, m, and N are integers, the multiplication of n and m can exceed the maximum limit of an integer, resulting in a negative value. This negative value is then assigned to the sample variable, causing the assertion error.": [
      "Using Long Data Type for Intermediate Calculations\nOne possible solution is to use the long data type for the intermediate calculations in the getNumericalMean() function. This can prevent integer overflow and ensure that the result is accurate. The modified function would look like this:\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    long numerator = (long) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses();\n    return (double) numerator / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}",
      "Using BigInteger for Large Numbers\nAnother possible solution is to use the BigInteger class for handling large numbers. This can provide a more robust solution for cases where the numbers are extremely large. The modified function would look like this:\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    BigInteger numerator = BigInteger.valueOf(getSampleSize()).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(getNumberOfSuccesses()));\n    BigInteger denominator = BigInteger.valueOf(getPopulationSize());\n    return numerator.doubleValue() / denominator.doubleValue();\n}",
      "Checking for Overflow Before Calculation\nA third possible solution is to check for potential overflow before performing the calculation. This can be done by checking if the product of n and m is greater than the maximum limit of an integer. If it is, then an alternative approach can be used to calculate the mean. The modified function would look like this:\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    if ((long) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses() > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {\n        // use an alternative approach to calculate the mean\n    } else {\n        return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n    }\n}"
