    "The root cause of the bug lies in the implementation of the getNumericalMean() function. The function calculates the mean of the HypergeometricDistribution as (n * m) / N. However, this calculation can result in a loss of precision due to integer division, especially when N is large. As a result, the calculated mean may not accurately represent the true mean of the distribution, leading to incorrect sampling.": [
      "Use Double Precision Division\nUse double precision division to avoid loss of precision. This can be achieved by casting the numerator to a double before performing the division. The modified getNumericalMean() function would be: return (double) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses() / getPopulationSize(); This solution is simple to implement and should provide accurate results without introducing significant computational overhead.",
      "Implement a More Accurate Formula\nConsider using a more accurate formula to calculate the mean, such as using the formula for the mean of a HypergeometricDistribution: n * m / N, but calculate it using a more numerically stable method, such as using the BigDecimal class in Java. This would provide a more precise calculation, but may increase computational complexity.",
      "Avoid Integer Division by Reordering Operations\nAvoid integer division by reordering the operations in the calculation. Instead of calculating (n * m) / N, calculate n * (m / (double) N). This reordering avoids the integer division and ensures that the division is performed using double precision. The modified getNumericalMean() function would be: return getSampleSize() * (getNumberOfSuccesses() / (double) getPopulationSize()); This solution is also simple to implement and should provide accurate results."
