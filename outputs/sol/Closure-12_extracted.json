    "The root cause of the bug is that the `hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode)` function always returns `false`, indicating that there is no exception handler for the given node. However, the trigger test creates a function with two try-catch blocks, which implies that there are exception handlers for the nodes in the control flow graph. This inconsistency between the `hasExceptionHandler` function and the trigger test causes the bug.": [
