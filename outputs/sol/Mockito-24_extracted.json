    "The root cause of the bug is that the compareTo method is always returning 1, regardless of whether the mock object is being compared to itself or not. This is because the current implementation of the compareTo method does not take into account the actual comparison, but instead always returns a non-zero value (1 in this case).": [
      "Modify the compareTo Method to Check for Self-Comparison\nModify the compareTo method to check if the mock object is being compared to itself. If so, return 0. Otherwise, return a non-zero value. This can be achieved by comparing the mock object with the object being compared to, using the '==' operator.\n\n```java\nelse if (methodsGuru.isCompareToMethod(invocation.getMethod())) {\n    Object mock = invocation.getMock();\n    Object other = invocation.getArguments()[0];\n    if (mock == other) {\n        return 0;\n    } else {\n        return 1;\n    }\n}\n```",
