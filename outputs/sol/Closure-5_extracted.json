    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `isInlinableObject` is not correctly handling the case where a property is deleted from an object. The function checks if a property is defined on the object literal, but it does not check if the property is deleted later. This causes the function to incorrectly inline the object even after a property is deleted.": [
      "Check for Deleted Properties\nOne potential fix is to add a check for deleted properties in the function. We can do this by iterating over the references and checking if any of them are delete statements. If we find a delete statement, we can set a flag to indicate that the object should not be inlined. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean isInlinableObject(List<Reference> refs) {\n  boolean ret = false;\n  Set<String> validProperties = Sets.newHashSet();\n  boolean deletedProperty = false;\n  for (Reference ref : refs) {\n    Node name = ref.getNode();\n    Node parent = ref.getParent();\n    Node gramps = ref.getGrandparent();\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n\n    // Check if the property is deleted\n    if (parent.isDelete()) {\n      deletedProperty = true;\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n\n    // If a property is deleted, do not inline the object\n    if (deletedProperty) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return ret;\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Property Check\nAnother potential fix is to use a more robust property check in the function. Instead of just checking if a property is defined on the object literal, we can check if the property is actually present on the object at runtime. This can be done by using a more advanced property checking algorithm or by using a library that provides this functionality. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nprivate boolean isInlinableObject(List<Reference> refs) {\n  boolean ret = false;\n  Set<String> validProperties = Sets.newHashSet();\n  for (Reference ref : refs) {\n    Node name = ref.getNode();\n    Node parent = ref.getParent();\n    Node gramps = ref.getGrandparent();\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n\n    // Check if the property is present on the object at runtime\n    if (!NodeUtil.isPropertyPresentOnObject(parent, gramps)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n  }\n  return ret;\n}\n```",
      "Add a Special Case for Deleted Properties\nA third potential fix is to add a special case for deleted properties in the function. We can do this by checking if the property is deleted and if so, returning false immediately. This will prevent the object from being inlined even if all other checks pass. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean isInlinableObject(List<Reference> refs) {\n  boolean ret = false;\n  Set<String> validProperties = Sets.newHashSet();\n  for (Reference ref : refs) {\n    Node name = ref.getNode();\n    Node parent = ref.getParent();\n    Node gramps = ref.getGrandparent();\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n\n    // Check if the property is deleted\n    if (parent.isDelete()) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n  }\n  return ret;\n}\n```"
