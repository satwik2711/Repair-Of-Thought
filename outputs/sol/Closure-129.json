The function annotateCalls is designed to annotate calls in the abstract syntax tree (AST) with properties indicating whether they are 'free' calls or direct calls to eval. The trigger test testIssue937 creates a compilation scenario where a function is called on a newly created object, and the expected result is a simple function call. However, the actual result includes an extra comma, indicating a potential issue with the annotation of the call.

If the call is on a newly created object, we should not set the FREE_CALL property to true. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the first child of the call node is a NEW expression.

If the call is on a property of a newly created object, we should not set the FREE_CALL property to true. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the first child of the call node is a NEW expression and the second child is a GETPROP expression.

We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the first child of the call node is a NEW expression, the second child is a GETPROP expression, and the property name is not \"eval\".
