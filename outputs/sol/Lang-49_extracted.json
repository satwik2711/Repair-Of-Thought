    "The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the numerator is 0 and the denominator is a non-zero value. In this case, the function should return a fraction with a numerator of 0 and a denominator of 1, but instead it is returning a fraction with a numerator of 0 and the original denominator.": [
      "Add Special Case for Zero Numerator\nWe can add a special case to the function to handle the scenario where the numerator is 0 and the denominator is a non-zero value. In this case, we can return a fraction with a numerator of 0 and a denominator of 1, regardless of the original denominator. The corrected function would be:\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    if (numerator == 0) {\n        return Fraction.getFraction(0, 1);\n    }\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);\n    if (gcd == 1) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);\n}\n```",
      "Use Math.abs for Denominator\nAnother possible solution is to use Math.abs for the denominator when calculating the GCD. This will ensure that the denominator is always positive, and the function will correctly handle the case where the numerator is 0 and the denominator is a non-zero value. The corrected function would be:\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), Math.abs(denominator));\n    if (gcd == 1) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);\n}\n```",
      "Check for Zero Numerator Before Calculating GCD\nWe can also check if the numerator is 0 before calculating the GCD. If the numerator is 0, we can return a fraction with a numerator of 0 and a denominator of 1, regardless of the original denominator. The corrected function would be:\n```java\npublic Fraction reduce() {\n    if (numerator == 0) {\n        return Fraction.getFraction(0, 1);\n    }\n    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(numerator, denominator);\n    if (gcd == 1) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);\n}\n```"
