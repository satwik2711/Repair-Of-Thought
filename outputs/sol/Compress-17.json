The function `parseOctal` is designed to parse an octal string from a buffer. It ignores leading spaces, checks for a trailing space or NUL, and may contain an additional trailing space or NUL. The function also handles cases where the input buffer contains all NULs or a leading NUL. The trigger test `testCompress197` is testing the parsing of a tar archive, and the error message indicates an error detected while parsing the header. This suggests that the issue is related to the parsing of the octal string in the tar archive header.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the end index in the `parseOctal` function.
