    "The issue lies in the fact that the `stopTime` is being set to the current time when the `stop()` method is called, instead of calculating the total time elapsed since the stopwatch was started. This is because the `stopTime` is being set to `System.currentTimeMillis()` without considering the time that has already passed since the stopwatch was started.": [
      "Calculate Total Time Elapsed\nCalculate the total time elapsed by subtracting the start time from the current time. This can be done by adding a `startTime` field to the `StopWatch` class and setting it to `System.currentTimeMillis()` when the `start()` method is called. Then, in the `stop()` method, calculate the total time elapsed by subtracting the `startTime` from the current time.",
      "Update the `stop()` Method to Account for Suspended Time\nUpdate the `stop()` method to account for the time that the stopwatch was suspended. This can be done by adding a `suspendedTime` field to the `StopWatch` class and incrementing it by the time that the stopwatch was suspended. Then, in the `stop()` method, add the `suspendedTime` to the total time elapsed.",

This can be done by keeping track of the elapsed time in a separate field and adding it to the `stopTime` when the `stop()` method is called.\n\nHere is the updated `stop()` method for",
