    "The issue lies in the fact that the `stopTime` is being updated with the current time in the `stop()` method, regardless of whether the stopwatch was previously suspended or not. This means that if the stopwatch was suspended and then stopped, the `stopTime` will be updated with the current time, which is not the correct behavior. The correct behavior should be to keep the `suspendTime` as the `stopTime` if the stopwatch was previously suspended.": [
