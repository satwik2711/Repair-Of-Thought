    "The root cause of the bug is that the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class is using JUnit classes, which is not expected. Specifically, the `handleVerifyException` method is catching `MockitoAssertionError` and `ArgumentsAreDifferent` exceptions, which are subclasses of JUnit's `AssertionFailedError`. This means that the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class is dependent on JUnit, which is not allowed.": [
      "Use a Custom Assertion Error\nInstead of using JUnit's `AssertionFailedError`, we can create a custom assertion error class that is not dependent on JUnit. This would involve creating a new class that extends `RuntimeException` and is used in place of `AssertionFailedError` in the `handleVerifyException` method. For example:\n\n```java\npublic class MockitoAssertionError extends RuntimeException {\n    public MockitoAssertionError(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe can then modify the `handleVerifyException` method to catch and throw this custom exception instead of `AssertionFailedError`.",
      "Use a Different Exception Handling Mechanism\nInstead of catching `MockitoAssertionError` and `ArgumentsAreDifferent` exceptions, we can use a different exception handling mechanism that does not involve JUnit classes. For example, we can use a try-catch block with a more general exception type, such as `RuntimeException`. This would involve modifying the `verify` method to catch `RuntimeException` instead of `MockitoAssertionError` and `ArgumentsAreDifferent`.\n\n```java\ntry {\n    delegate.verify(data);\n} catch (RuntimeException e) {\n    error = handleVerifyException(e);\n}\n```",
      "Remove the Dependency on JUnit\nIf possible, we can remove the dependency on JUnit from the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class altogether. This would involve refactoring the class to use a different verification mechanism that does not involve JUnit. For example, we can use a custom verification mechanism that does not rely on JUnit's assertion classes. This would require significant changes to the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class, but it would eliminate the dependency on JUnit altogether."
