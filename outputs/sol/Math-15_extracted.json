    "The root cause of the bug is in the handling of negative x values when y is a large positive number. The function is not correctly handling the case where y is an even integer, and x is negative. The function is returning the absolute value of the result instead of the correct negative value.": [
      "Correct Handling of Negative x Values\nWe can fix this bug by adding a check for negative x values when y is an even integer. If x is negative and y is an even integer, we should return the absolute value of the result multiplied by -1. We can add the following code to the function:\n```java\nif (x < 0 && y > 0 && y == (long) y && (long) y % 2 == 0) {\n    return -Math.abs(result);\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the function returns the correct negative value for negative x values when y is an even integer.",
      "Simplify the Handling of Negative x Values\nWe can simplify the handling of negative x values by using the Math.copySign function to copy the sign of x to the result. We can replace the existing code with the following:\n```java\nresult = Math.copySign(result, x);\n```\nThis will ensure that the result has the correct sign for negative x values.",
      "Handle Negative x Values in the Special Case\nWe can also handle negative x values by modifying the special case handling in the function. We can add the following code to the function:\n```java\nif (x < 0) {\n    // y is an even integer in this case\n    if (y >= TWO_POWER_52 || y <= -TWO_POWER_52) {\n        return Math.copySign(pow(-x, y), x);\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the function correctly handles negative x values in the special case where y is a large positive number."
