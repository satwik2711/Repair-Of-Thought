    "The root cause of the bug is that the `mayBeString` function is not correctly handling the hook and GT operators. Specifically, the function is not correctly handling the case where the hook operator is used with a conditional expression that has a string literal as one of its branches. This is causing the function to incorrectly return true for the second input in the trigger test.": [
      "Add Special Handling for Hook Operator\nOne potential fix is to add special handling for the hook operator in the `mayBeString` function. We can add a new case to the function that checks if the node is a hook operator, and if so, recursively calls the `mayBeString` function on the hook's operands. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the hook operator and returns the correct result. The modified code would be:\n```java\nstatic boolean mayBeString(Node n, boolean recurse) {\n  if (recurse) {\n    if (n instanceof Hook) {\n      return mayBeString(n.getOperand(0), recurse) || mayBeString(n.getOperand(1), recurse);\n    }\n    return allResultsMatch(n, MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE);\n  } else {\n    return mayBeStringHelper(n);\n  }\n}\n```",
      "Modify MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE\nAnother potential fix is to modify the `MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE` to correctly handle the hook and GT operators. We can modify the predicate to check if the node is a hook operator, and if so, recursively calls the `mayBeString` function on the hook's operands. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the hook operator and returns the correct result. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate static final Predicate<Node> MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE = new Predicate<Node>() {\n  @Override\n  public boolean apply(Node n) {\n    if (n instanceof Hook) {\n      return mayBeString(n.getOperand(0), true) || mayBeString(n.getOperand(1), true);\n    }\n    // existing code\n  }\n};\n```",
      "Add Special Handling for GT Operator\nA third potential fix is to add special handling for the GT operator in the `mayBeString` function. We can add a new case to the function that checks if the node is a GT operator, and if so, recursively calls the `mayBeString` function on the GT operator's operands. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the GT operator and returns the correct result. The modified code would be:\n```java\nstatic boolean mayBeString(Node n, boolean recurse) {\n  if (recurse) {\n    if (n instanceof GT) {\n      return mayBeString(n.getOperand(0), recurse) || mayBeString(n.getOperand(1), recurse);\n    }\n    return allResultsMatch(n, MAY_BE_STRING_PREDICATE);\n  } else {\n    return mayBeStringHelper(n);\n  }\n}\n```"
