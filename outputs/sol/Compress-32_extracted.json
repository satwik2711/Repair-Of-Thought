    "The root cause of the bug is that the 'applyPaxHeadersToCurrentEntry' method is trying to parse the GID value as an integer, which is not sufficient to hold large values. The method should be modified to handle large GID values correctly.": [
      "Use Long Instead of Integer\nOne possible fix is to use a long instead of an integer to parse the GID value. This would allow the method to handle large GID values correctly. The modified code would look like this: \n```java\nelse if (\"gid\".equals(key)){\n    currEntry.setGroupId(Long.parseLong(val));\n}\n```\nThis change would allow the method to handle GID values up to 2^63-1, which is a much larger range than the original integer parsing.",
      "Use BigInteger\nAnother possible fix is to use a BigInteger to parse the GID value. This would allow the method to handle very large GID values correctly. The modified code would look like this: \n```java\nelse if (\"gid\".equals(key)){\n    currEntry.setGroupId(new BigInteger(val).longValue());\n}\n```\nThis change would allow the method to handle GID values of any size, but it would also introduce additional overhead due to the use of BigInteger.",
      "Check for Large GID Values\nA third possible fix is to check if the GID value is too large to be parsed as an integer, and if so, throw a custom exception or handle it in a different way. The modified code would look like this: \n```java\nelse if (\"gid\".equals(key)){\n    if (val.length() > 9) { \n        throw new CustomException(\"GID value is too large\");\n    } else { \n        currEntry.setGroupId(Integer.parseInt(val));\n    }\n}\n```\nThis change would allow the method to handle GID values up to the original integer range, but it would also introduce additional error handling for large GID values."
