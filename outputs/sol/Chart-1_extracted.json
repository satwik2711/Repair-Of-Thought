      "Correct the Conditional Statement\nThe conditional statement 'if (dataset != null)' should be changed to 'if (dataset == null)' to return an empty collection when there is no dataset. The corrected code would be:\nif (dataset == null) {\n    return result;\n}",
      "Remove the Incorrect Conditional Statement\nAlternatively, the conditional statement 'if (dataset != null)' can be removed altogether, as it is not necessary to check for a non-null dataset at this point. The method will naturally return an empty collection if the dataset is null or empty.",
