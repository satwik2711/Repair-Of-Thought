    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the Base64 constructor is being called with a default value of false, which may not be the correct mode for encoding binary data. The constructor comment mentions that the encoding table is STANDARD_ENCODE_TABLE, but it does not specify the mode. The test case is expecting the encoder to work in a specific mode, but the constructor is not explicitly setting that mode. This mismatch between the expected and actual modes is likely causing the assertion failure.": [
      "Explicitly Set the Encoding Mode\nThe Base64 constructor should be modified to explicitly set the encoding mode to URL_SAFE, which is the expected mode for encoding binary data. This can be done by changing the constructor to `this(true)` to enable URL-safe encoding.",
      "Use the Correct Constructor\nInstead of calling the default constructor, the test case should use the constructor that takes a boolean parameter and pass `true` to enable URL-safe encoding. This ensures that the encoder is created with the correct mode.",
      "Modify the Constructor to Use URL_SAFE Mode by Default\nThe Base64 constructor can be modified to use URL_SAFE mode by default, instead of relying on the default value of `false`. This can be done by changing the constructor to `this(true)` and removing the boolean parameter. This ensures that all instances of the Base64 class will use URL_SAFE mode by default.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
