    "The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle undeclared namespaces correctly. When it encounters an element with an undeclared namespace, it tries to create a W3C DOM element with that namespace, which is not allowed. The function should instead treat the namespace as a local name and create a W3C DOM element without a namespace.": [
      "Treat Namespace as Local Name\nInstead of trying to create a W3C DOM element with the undeclared namespace, we can treat the namespace as a local name and create a W3C DOM element without a namespace. We can do this by checking if the namespace is declared before trying to create the W3C DOM element. If the namespace is not declared, we can use the local name instead. This can be achieved by modifying the line where the W3C DOM element is created to use the local name instead of the namespace.\n\n```java\nElement el = doc.createElementNS(null, tagName);\n```",
      "Declare Namespace\nAnother potential fix is to declare the namespace before trying to create the W3C DOM element. We can do this by adding a namespace declaration to the W3C DOM document before creating the element. This will ensure that the namespace is declared and the element can be created correctly. This can be achieved by adding the following line before creating the W3C DOM element.\n\n```java\ndoc.appendChild(doc.createProcessingInstruction(\"xmlns:fb\", \"http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml\"));\n```",
      "Ignore Namespace\nA third potential fix is to ignore the namespace altogether and create a W3C DOM element without a namespace. This will ensure that the element is created correctly, but it may not be the desired behavior if the namespace is important for the application. This can be achieved by modifying the line where the W3C DOM element is created to use the local name instead of the namespace.\n\n```java\nElement el = doc.createElement(tagName);\n```"
