    "The root cause of the bug is that the parseOctal function does not correctly handle the case where the input buffer contains a leading NUL followed by a valid octal string. The function returns 0 immediately when it encounters a leading NUL, without checking if the rest of the buffer contains a valid octal string. This causes the function to return an incorrect result, leading to the IllegalArgumentException being thrown.": [
      "Skip Leading NULs\nModify the parseOctal function to skip leading NULs instead of returning immediately. This can be done by adding a loop at the beginning of the function to skip any leading NULs. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the input buffer contains a leading NUL followed by a valid octal string.\n\n```java\n// Skip leading NULs\nwhile (start < end && buffer[start] == 0) {\n    start++;\n}\n```",
      "Check for Valid Octal String After Leading NUL\nModify the parseOctal function to check if the rest of the buffer contains a valid octal string after encountering a leading NUL. This can be done by adding a flag to indicate if a leading NUL has been encountered, and then checking if the rest of the buffer contains a valid octal string. If it does, the function can return the parsed octal string. If not, the function can throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n\n```java\n// Check for valid octal string after leading NUL\nboolean leadingNUL = false;\nif (buffer[start] == 0) {\n    leadingNUL = true;\n    start++;\n}\n// ... rest of the function remains the same ...\nif (leadingNUL && result == 0) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid octal string after leading NUL\");\n}\n```",
      "Modify Exception Handling\nModify the parseOctal function to throw an IOException instead of an IllegalArgumentException when it encounters an invalid octal string. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the input buffer contains an invalid octal string, and will match the expected behavior of the trigger test.\n\n```java\n// Modify exception handling\nif (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7') {\n    throw new IOException(\"Invalid octal string\");\n}\n```"
