This can be done by adding a separate method that checks if the format string contains any unterminated quotes. If such a quote is found, the method can throw an exception indicating that the format string is invalid. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate void init() {\n    ...\n    validateQuotes(pattern);\n    ...\n}\n\nprivate void validateQuotes(String pattern) {\n    int quoteCount = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < pattern.length(); i++) {\n        if (pattern.charAt(i) == '\\'') {\n            quoteCount++;\n        }\n    }\n    if (quoteCount % 2 != 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unterminated quote in format string\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Modify Regex Pattern\nA third possible fix is to modify the regular expression pattern used by the parser to correctly handle quotes in the format string. This can be done by adding a special character to the pattern that matches quotes. For example, the pattern can be modified to include a `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"` character that matches a quote. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate void init() {\n    ...\n    formatPattern = Pattern.compile(\"...\");\n    ...\n}\n```\nNote: The exact modification to the regex pattern will depend on the specific requirements of the parser and the format string.",
