    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `tryMinimizeExits` is not correctly handling `try-finally` blocks. Specifically, it is removing the `break` statement in the `finally` block, which is not allowed according to the ECMA 262 specification. This is because the function is not checking if the `finally` block has a `break` statement before removing it.": [
      "Add a Check for Finally Blocks\nOne possible fix is to add a check for `finally` blocks before removing the `break` statement. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the current node is a `finally` block, and if so, skip removing the `break` statement. This can be achieved by modifying the `tryMinimizeExits` function to include a check for `finally` blocks before calling `NodeUtil.removeChild(n.getParent(), n)`.",
      "Modify the Try-Finally Block Handling\nAnother possible fix is to modify the way the function handles `try-finally` blocks. Instead of removing the `break` statement, we can move it to the end of the `finally` block. This will ensure that the `break` statement is not lost, but still allow the function to minimize the number of explicit exit points. This can be achieved by modifying the `tryMinimizeExits` function to include a special case for `try-finally` blocks, where the `break` statement is moved to the end of the `finally` block instead of being removed.",
      "Add a Special Case for Break Statements\nA third possible fix is to add a special case for `break` statements in `try-finally` blocks. We can do this by adding a conditional statement to check if the current node is a `break` statement, and if so, skip removing it if it is in a `finally` block. This can be achieved by modifying the `tryMinimizeExits` function to include a check for `break` statements in `finally` blocks, and if so, skip removing them."
