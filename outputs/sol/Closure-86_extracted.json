    "The `evaluatesToLocalValue` function is not correctly handling the case where a node represents a method call on an object. In the trigger test, the `setLocation` method is called on an instance of `F`, but the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function is not correctly identifying this as a local value. This is because the function is not checking if the object being called is a local value.": [
      "Add Check for Object Locality\nWe can add a check to the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function to see if the object being called is a local value. This can be done by adding a new case to the switch statement to handle method calls on objects. In this case, we can check if the object being called is a local value by calling the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function recursively on the object. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\ncase Token.CALL:\n    Node callee = value.getFirstChild();\n    if (callee.getType() == Token.NAME) {\n        // Check if the object being called is a local value\n        if (evaluatesToLocalValue(callee, locals)) {\n            return callHasLocalResult(value) || isToStringMethodCall(value) || locals.apply(value);\n        }\n    }\n    return callHasLocalResult(value) || isToStringMethodCall(value) || locals.apply(value);\n```",
      "Modify CallHasLocalResult Method\nAnother potential fix is to modify the `callHasLocalResult` method to correctly handle method calls on objects. This method is currently not checking if the object being called is a local value, which is causing the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function to incorrectly identify the `setLocation` method as a non-local value. We can modify the `callHasLocalResult` method to check if the object being called is a local value by calling the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function recursively on the object.",
      "Add Additional Checks for Method Calls\nWe can also add additional checks to the `evaluatesToLocalValue` function to handle method calls on objects. For example, we can check if the method being called is a built-in method or a method defined on the object's prototype chain. This can help to correctly identify method calls on objects as local values. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\ncase Token.CALL:\n    Node callee = value.getFirstChild();\n    if (callee.getType() == Token.NAME) {\n        // Check if the method being called is a built-in method or a method defined on the object's prototype chain\n        if (isBuiltInMethod(callee) || isMethodOnPrototypeChain(callee)) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return callHasLocalResult(value) || isToStringMethodCall(value) || locals.apply(value);\n```"
