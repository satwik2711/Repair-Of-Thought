    "The issue lies in the 'burstToken' method. When 'stopAtNonOption' is set to true, the method is supposed to stop processing at the first non-option character and add the remaining characters as a single argument. However, the current implementation is adding the remaining characters as separate arguments. This is because the 'process' method is being called recursively with the remaining substring, which is causing the parser to treat each character as a separate argument.": [
      "Modify the 'burstToken' method to correctly handle the case when 'stopAtNonOption' is set to true.\n```java\nif (stopAtNonOption && !options.hasOption(ch)) {\n    tokens.add(token.substring(i));\n    break;\n}\n```\nThis suggestion involves adding a check to see if the current character is a non-option character and if 'stopAtNonOption' is set to true. If both conditions are true, we can add the remaining characters as a single argument and break out of the loop.",
