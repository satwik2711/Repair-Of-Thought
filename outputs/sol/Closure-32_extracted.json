    "The issue lies in the way the function handles whitespace and line breaks. Specifically, when the `option` parameter is set to `PRESERVE`, the function trims the extracted text, which removes the leading whitespace on each line. However, the expected result in the trigger test includes this whitespace. Additionally, the function appends a space before each line break, which is not present in the expected result.": [
      "Modify the trimming logic\nModify the trimming logic to only remove trailing whitespace when the `option` parameter is set to `PRESERVE`. This can be achieved by replacing the `trim()` method with a custom implementation that only removes trailing whitespace. For example, you can use the `replaceFirst()` method to remove the trailing whitespace:\n```java\nif (option != WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE) {\n    line = line.replaceFirst(\"\\\\s+$\", \"\");\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the leading whitespace is preserved, and only the trailing whitespace is removed.",
      "Remove the extra space before line breaks\nRemove the extra space that is appended before each line break when the `option` parameter is set to `PRESERVE`. This can be achieved by modifying the line `builder.append(' ');` to only append a space when necessary. For example, you can add a conditional statement to check if the `option` parameter is set to `PRESERVE` before appending the space:\n```java\nif (option != WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE) {\n    builder.append(' ');\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the extra space is not appended before each line break when the `option` parameter is set to `PRESERVE`.",
      "Use a different approach to handle whitespace\nInstead of using the `trim()` method, use a different approach to handle whitespace, such as using a regular expression to remove leading and trailing whitespace. This can provide more flexibility and accuracy in handling whitespace. For example, you can use the `replaceAll()` method to remove the leading and trailing whitespace:\n```java\nif (option != WhitespaceOption.PRESERVE) {\n    line = line.replaceAll(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\", \"\");\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the leading and trailing whitespace is removed, while preserving the whitespace within the text."
