The function `sample` is supposed to generate a random sample from a discrete distribution. It takes a sample size as input and returns an array of random values. The function also checks if the sample size is positive and throws an exception if it's not. The trigger test `testIssue942` creates a discrete distribution with two pairs of objects and doubles, and then calls the `sample` function with a sample size of 1. The error message indicates an `ArrayStoreException` when trying to store an object in the array.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Trigger Test and Error Message\",\n    \"content\": \"The trigger test creates a discrete distribution with two pairs of objects and doubles. The objects are instances of an anonymous class, and the doubles are 0 and 1. The test then calls the `sample` function with a sample size of 1 and asserts that the length of the returned array is 1. The error message indicates that an `ArrayStoreException` is thrown when trying to store an object in the array. This suggests that the issue is related to the type of objects being stored in the array.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Root Cause Analysis\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue is caused by the fact that the `sample` function creates an array of type `T` using `java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance`, but then tries to store objects of type `Object` in the array.
