    "The root cause of the bug is that the `JsonParser` is not consuming the current token after deserialization, which is causing the `UnrecognizedPropertyException` when trying to deserialize the `DataB` object. This is because the `JsonParser` is still pointing to the current token, which is not being consumed, and is causing the deserialization process to fail.": [
      "Consume Current Token After Deserialization\nOne potential fix is to consume the current token after deserialization by calling `jp.nextToken()` after the deserialization process. This will ensure that the `JsonParser` is pointing to the next token in the JSON string, and will prevent the `UnrecognizedPropertyException` from occurring. However, this approach may not be suitable if the current token is not supposed to be consumed.",
      "Reset JsonParser to Beginning of JSON String\nAnother potential fix is to reset the `JsonParser` to the beginning of the JSON string by calling `jp.reset()` after the deserialization process. However, this approach may not be suitable if the `JsonParser` is not supposed to be reset, and may cause other issues.",
      "Use JsonParser.nextToken() Before Deserialization\nA more suitable fix is to use `jp.nextToken()` before deserialization to ensure that the `JsonParser` is pointing to the correct token in the JSON string. This will ensure that the deserialization process starts from the correct token, and will prevent the `UnrecognizedPropertyException` from occurring. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprotected JsonNode _bindAsTree(JsonParser jp) throws IOException\n{\n    JsonNode result;\n    JsonToken t = _initForReading(jp);\n    if (t == JsonToken.VALUE_NULL || t == JsonToken.END_ARRAY || t == JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {\n        result = NullNode.instance;\n    } else {\n        DeserializationContext ctxt = createDeserializationContext(jp, _config);\n        JsonDeserializer<Object> deser = _findRootDeserializer(ctxt, JSON_NODE_TYPE);\n        if (_unwrapRoot) {\n            result = (JsonNode) _unwrapAndDeserialize(jp, ctxt, JSON_NODE_TYPE, deser);\n        } else {\n            jp.nextToken();\n            result = (JsonNode) deser.deserialize(jp, ctxt);\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n```"
