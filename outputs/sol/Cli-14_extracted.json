    "The root cause of the bug is that the `validate` method in the `FileValidator` class is expecting a `String` argument, but it is receiving a `File` object instead. This is because the `ArgumentBuilder` is creating an argument with a `FileValidator` that returns a `File` object, but the `FileValidator` is trying to validate it as a `String`. This mismatch in types is causing the `ClassCastException`.": [
      "Modify FileValidator to Expect File Object\nWe can modify the `validate` method in the `FileValidator` class to expect a `File` object instead of a `String`. This can be done by changing the type of the `values` parameter to `File[]` and modifying the validation logic accordingly. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic void validate(File[] values) {\n    // validation logic\n}\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and directly addresses the root cause of the bug.",
      "Use ArgumentBuilder with File Type\nWe can use the `ArgumentBuilder` to create an argument with a `File` type instead of a `String` type. This can be done by calling the `withType` method on the `ArgumentBuilder` and passing `File.class` as the argument. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nArgumentBuilder abuilder = new ArgumentBuilder();\nabuilder.withType(File.class);\n```\nThis solution is also straightforward and directly addresses the root cause of the bug.",
      "Modify Option to Expect File Argument\nWe can modify the `Option` class to expect a `File` argument instead of a `String` argument. This can be done by changing the type of the `argument` field to `File` and modifying the `validate` method accordingly. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic class Option {\n    private File argument;\n\n    public void validate(CommandLine commandLine) {\n        // validation logic\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution is more invasive and requires modifying the `Option` class, but it also directly addresses the root cause of the bug."
