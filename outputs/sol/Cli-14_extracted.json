    "The root cause of the bug is that the `validate` method in the `FileValidator` class is expecting a `String` argument, but it is receiving a `File` object instead. This is because the `ArgumentBuilder` is creating an argument with a `FileValidator` that returns a `File` object, but the `FileValidator` is trying to validate it as a `String`. This mismatch in types is causing the `ClassCastException`.": [
      "Modify FileValidator to Expect File Object\nWe can modify the `validate` method in the `FileValidator` class to expect a `File` object instead of a `String`. This can be done by changing the type of the `i.next()` method to `File` and removing the cast to `String`. This will ensure that the `FileValidator` is validating the argument as a `File` object, not as a `String`.",
      "Modify ArgumentBuilder to Return String\nAlternatively, we can modify the `ArgumentBuilder` to return a `String` instead of a `File` object. This can be done by changing the type of the `create` method to return a `String` instead of a `File`. This will ensure that the `FileValidator` is receiving a `String` argument, which it can validate correctly.",
      "Add Type Checking in FileValidator\nAnother potential fix is to add type checking in the `FileValidator` class to ensure that the argument is a `File` object before trying to validate it. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the `validate` method to ensure that the argument is an instance of `File`. If it is not, we can throw an exception or return an error message.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
