The `guessAOmega` method is part of a harmonic fitter and is used to estimate the amplitude and angular frequency of a harmonic function. The method uses a linear model to approximate the function and its derivative, and then uses these approximations to compute the amplitude and angular frequency. The method also checks for certain conditions that may indicate that the guessing procedure cannot produce sensible results, in which case it throws a `MathIllegalStateException`. The trigger test `testMath844` creates a set of points that represent a triangular periodic function, which is far from an harmonic function. The test then uses the `guessAOmega` method to estimate the amplitude and angular frequency of this function, which fails and throws a `MathIllegalStateException`.
