The `addValue` function is supposed to add 1 to the frequency count for a given value `v`. It also checks if `v` is comparable to previously added values. The trigger test `testAddNonComparable` tests this function by adding a non-comparable object and then a comparable object, expecting an `IllegalArgumentException` in both cases.
