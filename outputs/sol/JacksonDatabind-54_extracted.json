    "The root cause of the bug is that the `buildWriter` function is not correctly handling the case where the inclusion rule is set to `NON_ABSENT` and the property has a default value of null. In this case, the function should suppress the null value and not include it in the serialized output. However, the current implementation is not doing so, resulting in the incorrect output.": [
      "Modify Inclusion Rule Handling\nWe can modify the `buildWriter` function to correctly handle the case where the inclusion rule is set to `NON_ABSENT` and the property has a default value of null. We can add a check for this case and suppress the null value if necessary. Here's an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n```\nThis change would ensure that the null value is suppressed when the inclusion rule is set to `NON_ABSENT`.",
      "Use a Different Default Value\nAnother potential fix is to use a different default value for the property when the inclusion rule is set to `NON_ABSENT`. For example, we could use an empty string or an empty collection instead of null. This would ensure that the property is not included in the serialized output when it has a default value of null. Here's an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT) {\n    valueToSuppress = \"\";\n}\n```\nThis change would ensure that the property is not included in the serialized output when it has a default value of null.",
      "Modify the `getPropertyDefaultValue` Method\nWe can also modify the `getPropertyDefaultValue` method to return a different default value when the inclusion rule is set to `NON_ABSENT`. For example, we could return an empty string or an empty collection instead of null. This would ensure that the property is not included in the serialized output when it has a default value of null. Here's an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\npublic Object getPropertyDefaultValue(String propertyName, AnnotatedMember member, JavaType type) {\n    if (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_ABSENT) {\n        return \"\";\n    }\n    // ... rest of the method remains the same ...\n}\n```\nThis change would ensure that the property is not included in the serialized output when it has a default value of null."
