Here is an example:\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        try (OutputStream out = this.out) {\n            super.close();\n            this.closed = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the underlying output stream is properly closed, even if an exception is thrown.\n\nSuggestion 3: Override the close() Method\nWe can override the close() method to properly close the underlying output stream.
