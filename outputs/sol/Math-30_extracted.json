    "The issue lies in the calculation of the p-value in the `calculateAsymptoticPValue` method. The method uses the normal approximation of the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is only valid for large sample sizes. However, the calculation of the standard deviation `VarU` is incorrect. The correct formula for the variance of the Mann-Whitney U statistic is `VarU = (n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1)) / 12.0 - (n1 * n2 * (n1 * n2 - 1)) / (12.0 * (n1 + n2) * (n1 + n2 - 1))`. The incorrect calculation of `VarU` leads to an incorrect calculation of the standard deviation, which in turn affects the calculation of the p-value.": [
      "Correct Calculation of Variance\nThe calculation of `VarU` should be corrected to use the correct formula. This can be achieved by replacing the line `final double VarU = n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12.0;` with `final double VarU = (n1 * n2 * (n1 + n2 + 1)) / 12.0 - (n1 * n2 * (n1 * n2 - 1)) / (12.0 * (n1 + n2) * (n1 + n2 - 1));`.",
      "Use of Alternative Formula for Large Sample Sizes\nFor large sample sizes, an alternative formula for the variance of the Mann-Whitney U statistic can be used, which is `VarU = (n1 * n2) / 12.0`. This formula is more accurate for large sample sizes and can be used instead of the original formula.",
      "Use of Numerical Stability Techniques\nTo improve the numerical stability of the calculation, techniques such as using a more robust method for calculating the standard deviation or using a specialized library for statistical calculations can be employed. This can help to reduce the impact of rounding errors and improve the accuracy of the calculated p-value.\n\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
