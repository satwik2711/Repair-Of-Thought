    "The root cause of the bug is that the function findWrapPos is not correctly handling the case when the start position plus the width is equal to the length of the text. In this case, the function is trying to access the character at the index equal to the length of the text, which is out of bounds. This is because the function is using the condition pos <= text.length() to check if the position is within the bounds of the text, but this condition is not sufficient to prevent the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.": [
      "Check for Out of Bounds Before Accessing Character\nWe can add a check before accessing the character at the index pos to make sure that pos is within the bounds of the text. We can do this by changing the condition in the while loop to pos >= startPos && pos < text.length(). This will prevent the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.",
      "Handle the Case When Start Position Plus Width is Equal to Text Length\nWe can add a special case to handle the situation when the start position plus the width is equal to the length of the text. In this case, we can return the start position plus the width minus one, which is the last character in the text. This will prevent the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException and ensure that the function returns the correct wrap position.",
      "Use a Different Approach to Find the Wrap Position\nWe can use a different approach to find the wrap position. Instead of starting from the start position plus the width and moving backwards, we can start from the start position and move forwards. This will prevent the StringIndexOutOfBoundsException and make the function more efficient. We can use a for loop to iterate over the characters in the text, starting from the start position, and check if each character is a whitespace character. If we find a whitespace character, we can return its position as the wrap position."
