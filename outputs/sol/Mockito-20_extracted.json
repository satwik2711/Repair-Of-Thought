    "The root cause of the bug is that the `createMock` function is not properly handling the case when the mock object is created with a constructor. The `MockMethodInterceptor` is not being called when the mock object is created with a constructor, resulting in the mock object not being properly initialized.": [
      "Initialize Mock Object with Constructor\nInitialize the mock object with the constructor by calling the `MockMethodInterceptor` when the mock object is created with a constructor. This can be done by adding a check for the `useConstructor` setting in the `createMock` function and calling the `MockMethodInterceptor` accordingly. The `classInstantiator` should also be modified to handle the constructor parameters.\n\n```java\nif (settings.useConstructor()) {\n    // Initialize the mock object with the constructor\n    mockInstance = classInstantiator.instantiate(mockedProxyType, settings.getConstructorArgs());\n} else {\n    mockInstance = classInstantiator.instantiate(mockedProxyType);\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Instantiator\nUse a different instantiator that can handle the case when the mock object is created with a constructor. This can be done by modifying the `classInstantiator` to use a different instantiator that can handle constructors. For example, the `ObjenesisInstantiator` can be used to create objects without calling their constructors.\n\n```java\nclassInstantiator = new ObjenesisInstantiator();\n```",
      "Modify the Mock Creation Settings\nModify the mock creation settings to include the constructor parameters. This can be done by adding a new setting to the `MockCreationSettings` class to include the constructor parameters. The `createMock` function can then be modified to use these constructor parameters when creating the mock object.\n\n```java\npublic class MockCreationSettings<T> {\n    // ...\n    private Object[] constructorArgs;\n\n    public Object[] getConstructorArgs() {\n        return constructorArgs;\n    }\n\n    public void setConstructorArgs(Object[] constructorArgs) {\n        this.constructorArgs = constructorArgs;\n    }\n}\n```"
