    "The root cause of the bug is that the `processOptionToken` method is not correctly handling unrecognized options when `stopAtNonOption` is set to `false`. In this case, the method should throw an `UnrecognizedOptionException` when it encounters an unrecognized option. However, the current implementation only checks if the option exists and if `stopAtNonOption` is set, but it does not throw an exception when an unrecognized option is encountered.": [
      "Throw UnrecognizedOptionException when option does not exist\nThe `processOptionToken` method should be modified to throw an `UnrecognizedOptionException` when the option does not exist and `stopAtNonOption` is set to `false`. This can be achieved by adding an else clause to the if statement that checks if the option exists.",
