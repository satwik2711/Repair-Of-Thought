This can be achieved by adding a check for surrogate pairs and incrementing `pos` by 2 when a surrogate pair is found. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (consumed == 0) {\n    char[] c = Character.toChars(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n    out.write(c);\n    if (Character.isSurrogate(c[0])) {\n        pos += 2;\n    } else {\n        pos++;\n    }\n}\n```\nSuggestion 2: Use Character.codePointAt() to Handle Surrogate Pairs\nThe function can use `Character.codePointAt()` to handle surrogate pairs correctly. This method returns the Unicode code point at the specified index, taking into account surrogate pairs. The modified code would be:\n```java\nint codePoint = Character.codePointAt(input, pos);\nchar[] c = Character.toChars(codePoint);\nout.write(c);\npos += Character.charCount(codePoint);\n```\nSuggestion 3: Simplify the Translation Loop\nThe translation loop can be simplified by removing the unnecessary checks and increments.
