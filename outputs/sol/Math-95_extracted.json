    "The `getInitialDomain` function is returning an invalid value when the denominator degrees of freedom is 2.0. This is because the function is using the formula `d / (d - 2.0)`, which results in a division by zero when `d` is 2.0. This causes the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method to throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.": [
      "Handle Division by Zero\nOne possible fix is to add a special case to handle the division by zero when the denominator degrees of freedom is 2.0. We can return a default value or throw an exception in this case. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    if (d == 2.0) {\n        // handle division by zero\n        ret = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;\n    } else {\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Formula\nAnother possible fix is to use a different formula that does not involve division by zero. For example, we could use the formula `d / (d - 1.0)` when `d` is close to 2.0. However, this may affect the accuracy of the calculation. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    if (Math.abs(d - 2.0) < 1e-6) {\n        // use a different formula when d is close to 2.0\n        ret = d / (d - 1.0);\n    } else {\n        ret = d / (d - 2.0);\n    }\n    return ret;\n}\n```",
      "Add a Tolerance\nWe could also add a tolerance to the calculation to avoid division by zero. For example, we could use the formula `d / (d - 2.0 + tolerance)` where `tolerance` is a small positive value. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected double getInitialDomain(double p) {\n    double ret;\n    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();\n    double tolerance = 1e-6;\n    ret = d / (d - 2.0 + tolerance);\n    return ret;\n}\n```"
