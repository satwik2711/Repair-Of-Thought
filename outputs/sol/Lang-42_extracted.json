    "The function is not handling high Unicode characters correctly because it is not considering the surrogate pairs in the input string. In UTF-16 encoding, high Unicode characters are represented as surrogate pairs, which are two 16-bit code units that together represent a single Unicode character. The function is treating each code unit separately, resulting in incorrect output.": [
      "Handle Surrogate Pairs\nWe can modify the function to check if the current character is a high surrogate (0xD800 to 0xDBFF) and if the next character is a low surrogate (0xDC00 to 0xDFFF). If so, we can combine the two characters to form a single Unicode character and escape it accordingly. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check for surrogate pairs and then combining them to form a single Unicode character.",
      "Use Unicode Code Point\nWe can modify the function to use the Unicode code point of the character instead of its UTF-16 code unit. This will allow us to handle high Unicode characters correctly, even if they are represented as surrogate pairs. We can use the Character.codePointAt() method to get the Unicode code point of the character.",
      "Use a Unicode-Aware Library\nWe can modify the function to use a Unicode-aware library, such as the ICU library, to handle the escaping of high Unicode characters. This will ensure that the function handles all Unicode characters correctly, including those represented as surrogate pairs. We can use the ICU library's UCharacter class to get the Unicode code point of the character and then escape it accordingly."
