    "The root cause of the bug is the incorrect assumption that the `typeOfThis` will always resolve to an `ObjectType`. However, in the trigger test, the `typeOfThis` is a `UnionType` (specifically, `(Array|Date|null)`), which cannot be cast to an `ObjectType`. This is because the `safeResolve` method can return a `UnionType` if the type cannot be resolved to a single type.": [
      "Add a Type Check\nWe can add a type check before casting `typeOfThis` to an `ObjectType`. If it's a `UnionType`, we can either throw an error or handle it differently. For example, we could return a `UnionType` instead of an `ObjectType`. This would require modifying the method signature to return a `JSType` instead of an `ObjectType`.",
      "Use a More General Type\nInstead of casting `typeOfThis` to an `ObjectType`, we could use a more general type, such as `JSType`, which is the superclass of both `ObjectType` and `UnionType`. This would allow us to handle both cases without casting. We would need to modify the method to use `JSType` instead of `ObjectType` for the `typeOfThis` variable.",
      "Handle UnionType Specifically\nWe could add a specific check for `UnionType` and handle it differently. For example, we could try to resolve the `UnionType` to a single type, or return an error if it cannot be resolved. This would require adding additional logic to handle the `UnionType` case, but would allow us to keep the existing method signature."
