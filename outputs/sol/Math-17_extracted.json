    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the `multiplyFast` function is not handling large numbers correctly. When the input is a large number like 10000, the `multiplyFast` function is returning `NaN` instead of the correct result. This could be due to an overflow or underflow error in the `multiplyFast` function.": [
      "Handling Large Numbers\nOne possible fix is to add a check for large numbers in the `multiply` function and handle them separately. For example, we could use a different algorithm or data structure to handle large numbers. This would require modifying the `multiply` function to check for large numbers and call a different function or use a different algorithm to handle them.\n\n```java\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n    // Check if the input is a large number\n    if (Math.abs(x) > 1000) {\n        // Use a custom multiplication algorithm to handle large numbers\n        return multiplyLargeNumbers(x);\n    } else {\n        // Use the original multiplication algorithm for small numbers\n        return multiplyFast(x);\n    }\n}\n\n// Custom multiplication algorithm for large numbers\nprivate Dfp multiplyLargeNumbers(final int x) {\n    // Implement a custom multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers accurately\n    // For example, use a divide-and-conquer approach or a recursive approach\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Using a Different Data Structure\nAnother possible fix is to use a different data structure to represent the `Dfp` object. For example, we could use a `BigInteger` or `BigDecimal` to represent the `Dfp` object, which would allow us to handle large numbers more accurately. This would require modifying the `Dfp` class to use a different data structure and updating the `multiply` function to work with the new data structure.\n\n```java\npublic class Dfp {\n    private BigInteger value;\n\n    public Dfp(BigInteger value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n\n    public Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n        return new Dfp(value.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(x)));\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Implementing a Custom Multiplication Algorithm\nA third possible fix is to implement a custom multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers accurately. This would require modifying the `multiply` function to use a custom algorithm that can handle large numbers. For example, we could use a divide-and-conquer approach or a recursive approach to multiply the numbers.\n\n```java\npublic Dfp multiply(final int x) {\n    // Implement a custom multiplication algorithm that can handle large numbers accurately\n    // For example, use a divide-and-conquer approach or a recursive approach\n    // ...\n    return new Dfp(value.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(x)));\n}\n```"
