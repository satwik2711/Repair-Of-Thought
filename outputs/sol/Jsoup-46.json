This can be done by adding a special case for this character in the canEncode function. However, this approach may require significant changes to the canEncode function and may have unintended consequences.\n\nSuggestion 2: Modify the Escape Function\nA more straightforward fix is to modify the escape function to handle the non-breaking space character correctly. We can add a special case for this character in the escape function to append it as is when the escapeMode is set to xhtml. This approach is more targeted and less likely to introduce new issues.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a Different Encoding\nAnother possible fix is to use a different encoding that can handle the non-breaking space character correctly. For example, we could use the UTF-8 encoding instead of the Shift_JIS encoding.
