We can do this by adding the following line of code after creating the new object: `df.setLenient(((DateFormat) df).isLenient());`.

We can do this by adding a null check before calling the `setLenient` method, and setting the leniency of the new object using the following code: `if (df != null) { df.setLenient(((DateFormat) df).isLenient()); }`. This ensures that the cloned object is not null and has the same leniency as the original object, preventing the `NullPointerException` when calling `setLenient` on the cloned object.",
