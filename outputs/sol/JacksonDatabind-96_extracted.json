    "The root cause of the bug is that the `_addExplicitAnyCreator` method is not correctly handling the case where the creator property name is in snake case (e.g., 'param_name0') but the actual property name is in camel case (e.g., 'paramName0'). This is because the method is using the `findImplicitParamName` method to get the implicit name of the parameter, which does not take into account the naming strategy. As a result, the method is not correctly identifying the creator property and is throwing an `InvalidDefinitionException`.": [
      "Use Naming Strategy to Resolve Creator Property Name\nOne possible fix is to use the naming strategy to resolve the creator property name. We can modify the `_addExplicitAnyCreator` method to use the `resolvePropertyName` method of the `NamingStrategy` class to resolve the implicit name of the parameter. This will ensure that the method correctly identifies the creator property even if the property name is in snake case. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nparamName = ctxt.getNamingStrategy().resolvePropertyName(candidate.findImplicitParamName(0));\n```",
      "Modify findImplicitParamName Method to Handle Snake Case\nAnother possible fix is to modify the `findImplicitParamName` method to handle snake case property names. We can add a check to see if the property name is in snake case and if so, convert it to camel case before returning it. This will ensure that the method correctly identifies the creator property even if the property name is in snake case. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nprivate PropertyName findImplicitParamName(int index) {\n    PropertyName paramName = super.findImplicitParamName(index);\n    if (paramName != null && paramName.getSimpleName().contains(\"_\")) {\n        paramName = PropertyName.construct(paramName.getSimpleName().replace(\"_\", \"\"), paramName.getNamespace());\n    }\n    return paramName;\n}\n```",
      "Use PropertyName to Resolve Creator Property Name\nA third possible fix is to use the `PropertyName` class to resolve the creator property name. We can modify the `_addExplicitAnyCreator` method to use the `PropertyName` class to resolve the implicit name of the parameter. This will ensure that the method correctly identifies the creator property even if the property name is in snake case.
