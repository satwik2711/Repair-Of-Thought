    "The root cause of the bug is that the `manageDependencies` method is not correctly sorting the dependencies in whitespace mode. The method is supposed to reorder the inputs based on their dependencies, but it is not doing so correctly, resulting in the incorrect ordering of the `goog.provide` and `goog.require` statements.": [
      "Modify the manageDependencies Method to Use Topological Sorting\nThe `manageDependencies` method can be modified to use a topological sorting algorithm to ensure that the dependencies are correctly ordered in whitespace mode. This can be done by creating a graph data structure to represent the dependencies and then using a topological sorting algorithm to reorder the inputs. The modified method would first create a graph where each node represents an input and each edge represents a dependency between two inputs. Then, it would use a topological sorting algorithm to reorder the inputs based on their dependencies.",
      "Add a Special Case for Whitespace Mode in the manageDependencies Method\nA special case can be added to the `manageDependencies` method to handle whitespace mode. In this case, the method would check if the compilation level is set to WHITESPACE_ONLY and if so, use a different sorting algorithm or reorder the inputs manually. For example, it could use a simple sorting algorithm that reorders the inputs based on their dependencies, or it could use a more complex algorithm that takes into account the specific requirements of whitespace mode.",
      "Use a Dependency Graph to Represent Dependencies in the manageDependencies Method\nThe `manageDependencies` method can be modified to use a dependency graph to represent the dependencies between inputs. The graph would be created by iterating over the inputs and adding edges between nodes that represent dependencies. Then, the method would use a graph traversal algorithm to reorder the inputs based on their dependencies. This approach would ensure that the dependencies are correctly ordered in whitespace mode, and it would also provide a more efficient and scalable solution than the current implementation."
