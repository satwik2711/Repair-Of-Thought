The `getInitialDomain` function is used to access the initial domain value, based on the desired probability `p`, used to bracket a CDF root. This method is used by `inverseCumulativeProbability` to find critical values. The trigger test `testSmallDegreesOfFreedom` tests the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method with small degrees of freedom, and the error message indicates an invalid endpoint parameter.
