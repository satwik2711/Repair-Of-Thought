    "The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `mostNegative` variable in the `getSolution` method. The `mostNegative` variable is used to adjust the coefficients of the variables in the solution, but it is not correctly updated when the `restrictToNonNegative` flag is false. This causes the coefficients of the variables to be incorrectly adjusted, leading to negative values in the solution.": [
      "Update `mostNegative` Variable Conditionally\nUpdate the `mostNegative` variable only when the `restrictToNonNegative` flag is true. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to the calculation of the `mostNegative` variable. This will ensure that the `mostNegative` variable is only used when necessary, and will prevent the incorrect adjustment of the coefficients.\n\n```java\ndouble mostNegative = restrictToNonNegative ? 0 : getEntry(negativeVarBasicRow, getRhsOffset());\n```",
      "Use a Different Approach to Calculate Coefficients\nInstead of using the `mostNegative` variable to adjust the coefficients, use a different approach that does not rely on the `mostNegative` variable. For example, calculate the coefficients directly from the basic rows and columns. This will eliminate the need for the `mostNegative` variable and will prevent the incorrect adjustment of the coefficients.\n\n```java\ndouble[] coefficients = new double[getOriginalNumDecisionVariables()];\nfor (int i = 0; i < coefficients.length; i++) {\n    int colIndex = columnLabels.indexOf(\"x\" + i);\n    if (colIndex < 0) {\n        coefficients[i] = 0;\n        continue;\n    }\n    Integer basicRow = getBasicRow(colIndex);\n    coefficients[i] = basicRow == null ? 0 : getEntry(basicRow, getRhsOffset());\n}\n```",
      "Add Additional Checks for Negative Values\nAdd additional checks to ensure that the coefficients are not negative. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if the coefficient is negative, and if so, set it to zero. This will prevent the solution from containing negative values, even if the `mostNegative` variable is not correctly updated.\n\n```java\ndouble[] coefficients = new double[getOriginalNumDecisionVariables()];\nfor (int i = 0; i < coefficients.length; i++) {\n    int colIndex = columnLabels.indexOf(\"x\" + i);\n    if (colIndex < 0) {\n        coefficients[i] = 0;\n        continue;\n    }\n    Integer basicRow = getBasicRow(colIndex);\n    coefficients[i] = basicRow == null ? 0 : getEntry(basicRow, getRhsOffset());\n    if (coefficients[i] < 0) {\n        coefficients[i] = 0;\n    }\n}\n```"
