      "Initialize Record Separator in withHeader Method\nThe `withHeader` method should be updated to initialize the `recordSeparator` field with the correct value. This can be done by adding a line to set the `recordSeparator` field to the correct value. However, since we are not allowed to modify the class or add new functions, we can modify the buggy function to handle this case.",

This solution is more straightforward and does not require defining a default record separator. \n\nHere is the modified buggy function based on",
