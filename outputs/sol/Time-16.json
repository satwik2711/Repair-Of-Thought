Buggy Function: \n/**\n* Parses a datetime from the given text, at the given position, saving the\n* result into the fields of the given ReadWritableInstant.

All other fields will remain unaltered. Thus if the string only\n* contains a year and a month, then the day and time will be retained from\n* the input instant. If this is not the behaviour you want, then reset the\n* fields before calling this method, or use {@link #parseDateTime(String)}\n* or {@link #parseMutableDateTime(String)}.\n* <p>\n* If it fails, the return value is negative, but the instant may still be\n* modified. To determine the position where the parse failed, apply the\n* one's complement operator (~) on the return value.\n* <p>\n* This parse method ignores the {@link #getDefaultYear() default year} and\n* parses using the year from the supplied instant as the default.\n* <p>\n* The parse will use the chronology of the instant.\n*\n* @param instant  an instant that will be modified, not null\n* @param text  the text to parse\n* @param position  position to start parsing from\n* @return new position, negative value means parse failed -\n*  apply complement operator (~) to get position of failure\n* @throws UnsupportedOperationException if parsing is not supported\n* @throws IllegalArgumentException if the instant is null\n* @throws IllegalArgumentException if any field is out of range\n*/\npublic int parseInto(ReadWritableInstant instant, String text, int position) {\n    DateTimeParser parser = requireParser();\n    if (instant == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Instant must not be null\");\n    }\n    \n    long instantMillis = instant.getMillis();\n    Chronology chrono = instant.getChronology();\n    long instantLocal = instantMillis + chrono.getZone().getOffset(instantMillis);\n    chrono = selectChronology(chrono);\n    \n    DateTimeParserBucket bucket = new DateTimeParserBucket(\n        instantLocal, chrono, iLocale, iPivotYear, iDefaultYear);\n    int newPos = parser.parseInto(bucket, text, position);\n    instant.setMillis(bucket.computeMillis(false, text));\n    if (iOffsetParsed && bucket.getOffsetInteger() != null) {\n        int parsedOffset = bucket.getOffsetInteger();\n        DateTimeZone parsedZone = DateTimeZone.forOffsetMillis(parsedOffset);\n        chrono = chrono.withZone(parsedZone);\n    } else if (bucket.getZone() != null) {\n        chrono = chrono.withZone(bucket.getZone());\n    }\n    instant.setChronology(chrono);\n    if (iZone != null) {\n        instant.setZone(iZone);\n    }\n    return newPos;\n}\n\n2.

This could involve using a different parser or modifying the existing parser to handle the year correctly. One possible approach is to use a parser that uses the year from the input instant as the default year, unless the year is explicitly specified in the input text.
