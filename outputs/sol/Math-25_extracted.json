    "The root cause of the bug is that the `guessAOmega` method is not able to handle cases where the function is far from an harmonic function. The method uses a linear model to approximate the function and its derivative, which is not sufficient to capture the behavior of a triangular periodic function. As a result, the method throws a `MathIllegalStateException` when it is unable to produce sensible results.": [
      "Improve the Linear Model\nOne potential fix is to improve the linear model used to approximate the function and its derivative. This could involve using a higher-order polynomial or a more sophisticated model that is able to capture the behavior of a triangular periodic function. For example, we could use a quadratic model instead of a linear model, or we could use a model that is specifically designed to handle periodic functions.",
      "Add Additional Checks\nAnother potential fix is to add additional checks to the `guessAOmega` method to handle cases where the function is far from an harmonic function. For example, we could check the range of the function values and throw a `MathIllegalStateException` if the range is too large. We could also check the number of local maxima and minima in the function and throw a `MathIllegalStateException` if there are too many.",
      "Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Method\nA third potential fix is to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to estimate the amplitude and angular frequency of the function. This method is able to capture the behavior of a triangular periodic function more accurately than the current method. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate void guessAOmega() {\n    // Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to estimate the amplitude and angular frequency\n    double[] fft = new double[observations.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i < observations.length; i++) {\n        fft[i] = observations[i].getY();\n    }\n    double[] fftOut = FFT.fft(fft);\n    double amplitude = 0;\n    double angularFrequency = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < fftOut.length; i++) {\n        if (fftOut[i] > amplitude) {\n            amplitude = fftOut[i];\n            angularFrequency = 2 * Math.PI * i / observations.length;\n        }\n    }\n    a = amplitude;\n    omega = angularFrequency;\n}\n```"
