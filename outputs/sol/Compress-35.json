Buggy Function: \n/**\n* Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)#File_header\">says</a>:\n* <blockquote>\n* The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values\n* of the header block with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii\n* spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit octal number with\n* leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various\n* implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility,\n* ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and get the first six digits. In\n* addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed.\n* Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it\n* as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included\n* checksum.\n* </blockquote>\n* <p>\n* The return value of this method should be treated as a best-effort\n* heuristic rather than an absolute and final truth. The checksum\n* verification logic may well evolve over time as more special cases\n* are encountered.\n*\n* @param header tar header\n* @return whether the checksum is reasonably good\n* @see <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-191\">COMPRESS-191</a>\n* @since 1.5\n*/\npublic static boolean verifyCheckSum(byte[] header) {\n    long storedSum = 0;\n    long unsignedSum = 0;\n    long signedSum = 0;\n\n    int digits = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < header.length; i++) {\n        byte b = header[i];\n        if (CHKSUM_OFFSET  <= i && i < CHKSUM_OFFSET + CHKSUMLEN) {\n            if ('0' <= b && b <= '7' && digits++ < 6) {\n                storedSum = storedSum * 8 + b - '0';\n            } else if (digits > 0) {\n                digits = 6;\n            }\n            b = ' ';\n        }\n        unsignedSum += 0xff & b;\n        signedSum += b;\n    }\n    return storedSum == unsignedSum || storedSum == signedSum;\n}\n\n2.
