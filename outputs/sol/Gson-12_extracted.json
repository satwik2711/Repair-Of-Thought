    "The `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` occurs because the `stackSize` variable is 0 when the `skipValue` method is called, causing the index `stackSize - 1` to be -1, which is out of bounds for the `pathNames` array. This happens because the `stackSize` variable is not updated correctly when the `JsonTreeReader` instance is initialized with a `JsonObject`.": [
      "Initialize Stack Size\nOne possible fix is to initialize the `stackSize` variable to 1 when the `JsonTreeReader` instance is initialized with a `JsonObject`. This can be done by adding a line to the constructor of the `JsonTreeReader` class: `stackSize = 1;`. This ensures that the `stackSize` variable is not 0 when the `skipValue` method is called.",
      "Check Stack Size Before Accessing\nAnother possible fix is to add a check before accessing the `pathNames` array to ensure that the `stackSize` variable is not 0. This can be done by adding a conditional statement before the line that causes the error: `if (stackSize > 0) { pathNames[stackSize - 1] = \"null\"; }`. This prevents the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` from occurring.",
      "Update Stack Size in Skip Value\nA third possible fix is to update the `stackSize` variable in the `skipValue` method before accessing the `pathNames` array. This can be done by adding a line to the `skipValue` method: `stackSize = Math.max(stackSize, 1);`. This ensures that the `stackSize` variable is not 0 when accessing the `pathNames` array."
