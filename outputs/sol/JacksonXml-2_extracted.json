    "The issue lies in the way the parser handles text content when it's followed by another element. In the buggy function, when the parser encounters text content followed by a `START_ELEMENT`, it ignores the text content. However, in the case of mixed content, this text content is important and should be parsed as the value of the parent element. The current implementation is not correctly handling this scenario.": [
      "Handle Text Content Before START_ELEMENT\nOne possible fix is to modify the parser to handle text content before encountering a `START_ELEMENT`. This can be done by adding a check for text content before the `if (_xmlReader.getEventType() == XMLStreamReader.START_ELEMENT)` condition. If text content is found, it should be parsed as the value of the parent element. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\n// If we have no/all-whitespace text followed by START_ELEMENT, ignore text\nString text = _collectUntilTag();\nif (text != null && !text.trim().isEmpty()) {\n    _textValue = text;\n    return (_currentState = XML_TEXT);\n}\nif (_xmlReader.getEventType() == XMLStreamReader.START_ELEMENT) {\n    return _initStartElement();\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Parser to Handle Mixed Content\nAnother possible fix is to modify the parser to handle mixed content more robustly. This can be done by adding a new state to the parser that specifically handles mixed content. In this state, the parser would parse both text content and child elements, and correctly handle the transition between them. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\n// Add a new state to handle mixed content\ncase XML_MIXED_CONTENT:\n    // Parse text content and child elements\n    String text = _collectUntilTag();\n    if (text != null) {\n        _textValue = text;\n    }\n    if (_xmlReader.getEventType() == XMLStreamReader.START_ELEMENT) {\n        return _initStartElement();\n    }\n    return (_currentState = XML_MIXED_CONTENT);\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Parsing Algorithm\nA more robust fix would be to use a more advanced parsing algorithm that can handle mixed content more effectively. This could involve using a parsing algorithm that can handle the complexities of mixed content, such as a recursive descent parser or a parser generator tool. This would require a more significant rewrite of the parser, but would provide a more robust and maintainable solution."
