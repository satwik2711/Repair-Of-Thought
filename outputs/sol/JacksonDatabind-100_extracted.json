    "The issue is caused by the fact that the `getBinaryValue` method does not properly handle the case where the input data is a single byte. When the input data is a single byte, the `binaryValue` method returns null, and the `getBinaryValue` method throws an exception. This is because the `binaryValue` method is designed to work with binary data that is at least 2 bytes long.": [
      "Handle Single Byte Input\nOne possible fix is to add a special case to the `getBinaryValue` method to handle single byte input. This can be done by checking the length of the input data and returning a byte array with a single element if the length is 1. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic byte[] getBinaryValue(Base64Variant b64variant)\n    throws IOException, JsonParseException\n{\n    JsonNode n = currentNode();\n    if (n != null) {\n        byte[] data = n.binaryValue();\n        if (data != null) {\n            return data;\n        }\n        if (n.isPojo()) {\n            Object ob = ((POJONode) n).getPojo();\n            if (ob instanceof byte[]) {\n                return (byte[]) ob;\n            }\n        }\n        // Handle single byte input\n        if (n.isTextual()) {\n            String text = n.textValue();\n            if (text.length() == 1) {\n                return new byte[] { (byte) text.charAt(0) };\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Encoding Scheme\nAnother possible fix is to use a different encoding scheme that can handle single byte input. For example, the `Base64Variant` class has a `MODIFIED_FOR_URL_SAFE` variant that can handle single byte input. This can be done by replacing the `MODIFIED_FOR_URL` variant with the `MODIFIED_FOR_URL_SAFE` variant in the `testBase64Text` method.",
      "Modify the `binaryValue` Method\nA third possible fix is to modify the `binaryValue` method to return a non-null value for single byte input. This can be done by adding a special case to the `binaryValue` method to handle single byte input. However, this would require modifying the `JsonNode` class, which is not recommended. Instead, the `getBinaryValue` method can be modified to handle single byte input, as shown in Suggestion 1."
