Specifically, when the function is trying to adjust the offset to the later one, it's using the `instantBefore` value instead of the `instantAfter` value.

Instead of using the `instantBefore` value, the function should use the `instantAfter` value. This can be done by changing the line `return convertLocalToUTC(local, false, earlierOrLater ? instantAfter : instantBefore);` to `return convertLocalToUTC(local, false, earlierOrLater ? instantAfter : instant);`.

This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if the `instantBefore` and `instantAfter` values are equal. If they are equal, it means that there is no overlap, and the function can return the original `instant` value. This fix can be implemented by adding the following code before the return statement: `if (instantBefore == instantAfter) { return instant; }`. This ensures that the function handles the no-overlap scenario correctly.\n\nSuggestion 3: Using a Different Approach for Later Offset\nA third potential fix is to use a different approach to adjust the offset to the later one. Instead of using the `convertUTCToLocal` and `convertLocalToUTC` functions, the function could use the `DateTimeZone` object to get the offset for the specific date and time. This can be done by replacing the line `return convertLocalToUTC(local, false, earlierOrLater ? instantAfter : instantBefore);` with `return zone.getOffset(instant) + (earlierOrLater ? DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_HOUR : 0);`. This fix ensures that the function returns the correct result when adjusting the offset to the later one.",
