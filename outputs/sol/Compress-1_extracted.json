    "The root cause of the bug is that the close() method of the CpioArchiveOutputStream class is not properly closing the underlying output stream, leading to an EOFException when trying to read the next entry from the CPIO archive input stream. This is because the close() method only calls the superclass's close() method, but does not properly close the underlying output stream.": [
      "Close the Underlying Output Stream\nWe can modify the close() method to also close the underlying output stream. This can be done by calling the close() method on the underlying output stream after calling the superclass's close() method. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        super.close();\n        this.out.close();\n        this.closed = true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the underlying output stream is properly closed, preventing the EOFException.",
      "Use a Try-with-Resources Statement\nWe can use a try-with-resources statement to ensure that the underlying output stream is properly closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This can be done by wrapping the code that uses the output stream in a try-with-resources statement. Here is an example:\n```java\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        try (OutputStream out = this.out) {\n            super.close();\n            this.closed = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the underlying output stream is properly closed, even if an exception is thrown.",
      "Override the close() Method\nWe can override the close() method to properly close the underlying output stream. This can be done by calling the close() method on the underlying output stream and then calling the superclass's close() method. Here is the modified code:\n```java\n@Override\npublic void close() throws IOException {\n    if (!this.closed) {\n        this.out.close();\n        super.close();\n        this.closed = true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution ensures that the underlying output stream is properly closed, preventing the EOFException."
