This can be done by replacing the line 'int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);' with 'int g = (int) ((Math.max(this.lowerBound, Math.min(value, this.upperBound)) - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);'.

This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function and returning a default color if the input value is outside the bounds. For example, 'if (value < this.lowerBound) return Color.black; if (value > this.upperBound) return Color.white;'. This ensures that the function handles out-of-bounds values correctly, preventing the error from occurring.",
