    "The root cause of the bug is that the function doSolve() does not properly handle cases where the initial interval [x0, x1] does not bracket the root, leading to an infinite loop and excessive evaluations. This is because the function only checks if the new approximation x is within the interval [x0, x1] but does not ensure that the interval is updated correctly when the new approximation is outside the interval.": [
      "Update Interval Bounds\nUpdate the interval bounds [x0, x1] when the new approximation x is outside the interval. This can be done by checking if x is less than x0 or greater than x1 and updating the corresponding bound. This will ensure that the interval is updated correctly and the function will not enter an infinite loop.\n\n```java\n// Update the interval bounds [x0, x1] when the new approximation x is outside the interval\nif (x < x0) {\n    x1 = x0;\n    x0 = x;\n    f1 = f0;\n    f0 = fx;\n} else if (x > x1) {\n    x0 = x1;\n    x1 = x;\n    f0 = f1;\n    f1 = fx;\n}\n```",
      "Check for Infinite Loop\nAdd a check to detect if the function is entering an infinite loop. This can be done by keeping track of the number of iterations and checking if the interval is being updated correctly. If the function is entering an infinite loop, it can throw an exception or return an error value.\n\n```java\n// Add a check to detect if the function is entering an infinite loop\nint iterationCount = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n    // ...\n    iterationCount++;\n    if (iterationCount > MAX_ITERATIONS) {\n        throw new TooManyEvaluationsException(\"Infinite loop detected\");\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Improve Initial Interval Selection\nImprove the selection of the initial interval [x0, x1] to ensure that it brackets the root. This can be done by using a more robust method for selecting the initial interval, such as using a larger interval or using a different method for selecting the initial interval.\n\n```java\n// Improve the selection of the initial interval [x0, x1]\ndouble x0 = getMin() - DELTA;\ndouble x1 = getMax() + DELTA;\ndouble f0 = computeObjectiveValue(x0);\ndouble f1 = computeObjectiveValue(x1);\n```"
