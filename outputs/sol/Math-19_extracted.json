    "The root cause of the bug is that the `checkParameters()` function does not properly handle large boundary ranges. Specifically, it does not check for overflow when normalizing the variables, which can result in NaN (Not a Number) values being produced. This, in turn, causes the `MathIllegalStateException` to be thrown instead of the expected `NumberIsTooLargeException`. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that the `testBoundaryRangeTooLarge()` test case uses a very large boundary range, which triggers the overflow condition.": [
      "Add Overflow Check\nAdd a check for overflow when normalizing the variables. This can be done by checking if the result of the subtraction `boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i]` is greater than `Double.MAX_VALUE`. If it is, throw a `NumberIsTooLargeException`. This can be implemented by adding a simple if statement to check for overflow:\n```java\nif (boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i] > Double.MAX_VALUE) {\n    throw new NumberIsTooLargeException();\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, and it addresses the root cause of the bug.",
      "Use a More Robust Normalization Method\nInstead of using the simple subtraction method to normalize the variables, use a more robust method that can handle large boundary ranges. For example, we could use the `Math.log()` function to normalize the variables, which would avoid the overflow issue. This can be implemented by replacing the subtraction with a logarithmic normalization:\n```java\ndouble normalizedValue = Math.log(boundaries[1][i] / boundaries[0][i]);\n```\nThis fix is more complex, but it provides a more robust solution that can handle a wider range of boundary values.",
      "Increase the Precision of the Normalization\nIncrease the precision of the normalization by using a higher-precision data type, such as `BigDecimal`. This would allow us to handle larger boundary ranges without overflowing. This can be implemented by replacing the `double` data type with `BigDecimal`:\n```java\nBigDecimal boundaries = new BigDecimal[2][];\n// ...\nBigDecimal normalizedValue = boundaries[1][i].subtract(boundaries[0][i]);\n```\nThis fix is more complex, but it provides a more precise solution that can handle a wider range of boundary values."
