This would prevent overflow from occurring, but it would also increase the memory usage of the class. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nBigInteger p2 = BigInteger.valueOf(a1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(p1)).add(BigInteger.valueOf(p0));\nBigInteger q2 = BigInteger.valueOf(a1).multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(q1)).add(BigInteger.valueOf(q0));\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Reduce the Value of maxDenominator\nA third possible fix is to reduce the value of maxDenominator. This would prevent the variables p2 and q2 from growing too large and overflowing. However, this would also reduce the accuracy of the fraction. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nint maxDenominator = 1000000; // reduce the value of maxDenominator\n```",
