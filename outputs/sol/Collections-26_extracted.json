    "The `readResolve()` method is not being called after deserialization, which means that the `calculateHashCode(keys)` method is not being called to recalculate the hash code. This is because the `readResolve()` method is not being overridden in the `DerivedMultiKey` class, so the default implementation is being used, which does not call `calculateHashCode(keys)`.": [
      "Override readResolve() in DerivedMultiKey\nTo fix this bug, we can override the `readResolve()` method in the `DerivedMultiKey` class, and call `calculateHashCode(keys)` to recalculate the hash code after deserialization. This would ensure that the hash code is recalculated correctly after deserialization. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nprivate Object readResolve() {\n    calculateHashCode(keys);\n    return this;\n}\n```\nThis solution is the most straightforward and requires the least amount of code changes.",
      "Call calculateHashCode() in readResolve() of MultiKey\nAnother potential fix is to modify the `readResolve()` method in the `MultiKey` class to call `calculateHashCode(keys)` to recalculate the hash code after deserialization. This would ensure that the hash code is recalculated correctly after deserialization, without requiring any changes to the `DerivedMultiKey` class. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nprivate Object readResolve() {\n    calculateHashCode(keys);\n    return this;\n}\n```\nThis solution requires modifying the `MultiKey` class, but does not require any changes to the `DerivedMultiKey` class.",
      "Use a Different Serialization Mechanism\nA third potential fix is to use a different serialization mechanism, such as JSON or XML serialization, which would not require the use of `readResolve()` to recalculate the hash code. This would require significant changes to the serialization and deserialization code, but would avoid the need to override `readResolve()` or modify the `MultiKey` class. For example, we could use the Jackson library to serialize and deserialize the `DerivedMultiKey` objects:\n```java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nString json = mapper.writeValueAsString(mk);\nDerivedMultiKey<?> mk2 = mapper.readValue(json, DerivedMultiKey.class);\n```\nThis solution requires significant changes to the serialization and deserialization code, but would avoid the need to override `readResolve()` or modify the `MultiKey` class."
