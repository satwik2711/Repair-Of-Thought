    "The root cause of the bug is in the isQualifiedNameInferred function, which is used to determine whether a qualified name is inferred. The function checks if the declaration has JSDoc type information, or @const with a known type, or a function literal with a name we haven't seen before. However, the function does not correctly handle the case where the prototype property of an object is assigned a value that is not a function. In this case, the function incorrectly infers that the prototype property is declared, when in fact it is not.": [
      "Add Additional Check for Prototype Property\nOne potential fix is to add an additional check in the isQualifiedNameInferred function to see if the qualified name is the prototype property of an object. If it is, we can then check if the assigned value is a function. If it is not a function, we can return false to indicate that the prototype property is not declared. This can be achieved by adding the following condition to the function:\nif (qName != null && qName.endsWith(\\\".prototype\\\") && rhsValue != null && !rhsValue.isFunction()) {\n    return false;\n}",
      "Modify Function to Handle Non-Function Assignments\nAnother potential fix is to modify the isQualifiedNameInferred function to handle non-function assignments to the prototype property. We can do this by adding a new condition to the function that checks if the assigned value is not a function. If it is not a function, we can return false to indicate that the prototype property is not declared. This can be achieved by adding the following condition to the function:\nif (rhsValue != null && !rhsValue.isFunction() && qName != null && qName.endsWith(\\\".prototype\\\")) {\n    return false;\n}",
      "Use a More Robust Type Checking Algorithm\nA third potential fix is to use a more robust type checking algorithm that can correctly handle the case where the prototype property of an object is assigned a value that is not a function. This could involve using a more advanced type checking algorithm that can analyze the types of the assigned values and determine whether they are compatible with the declared types. This can be achieved by replacing the existing type checking logic with a more advanced algorithm that can handle complex type relationships.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
