    "The `NullPointerException` is caused by the fact that the `cls` variable is null when trying to get its simple name. This happens because the `getSuperclass()` method returns null when the class is an interface or a primitive type. In this case, the `raw` variable is an interface, and the `getSuperclass()` method returns null, causing the `cls` variable to be null.": [
      "Add a null check before trying to get the simple name of the class\nAdd a simple if statement to check if the `cls` variable is null before trying to get its simple name. This will prevent the `NullPointerException` from being thrown. The modified code will look like this:\n```java\nfor (Class<?> cls = raw; cls != Object.class; cls = cls.getSuperclass()) {\n    if (cls == null) {\n        break;\n    }\n    String name = cls.getSimpleName();\n    // ...\n}\n```",

This will prevent any potential issues with the null check. The modified code will look like this:\n```java\nfor (Class<?> cls = raw; cls != Object.class; cls = cls.getSuperclass()) {\n    if (cls == null || cls.isInterface() || cls.isPrimitive()) {\n        break;\n    }\n    String name = cls.getSimpleName();\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Use the `getDeclaringClass()` method instead of `getSuperclass()`\nUse the `getDeclaringClass()` method instead of `getSuperclass()` to get the class that declares the `cls` variable. This will prevent the `NullPointerException` from being thrown and will also prevent any potential issues with the null check. However, this approach may not be suitable if the intention is to get the superclass of the class. The modified code will look like this:\n```java\nfor (Class<?> cls = raw; cls != Object.class; cls = cls.getDeclaringClass()) {\n    String name = cls.getSimpleName();\n    // ...\n}\n```"
