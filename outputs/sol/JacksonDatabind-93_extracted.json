    "The `NullPointerException` is caused by the `cls.getSimpleName()` call in the `validateSubType` function. This is because the `cls` variable is `null` when the `getSuperclass()` method returns `null` for the `Object` class. This happens when the `raw` class is an interface, not a class, and therefore does not have a superclass.": [
