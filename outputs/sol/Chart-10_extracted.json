    "The root cause of the bug is that the generateToolTipFragment function is not properly escaping the double quote character in the input string. In HTML, the double quote character is escaped using '&quot;'. However, in the given function, the double quote character is not being replaced with its corresponding HTML entity.": [
      "Replace Double Quote with HTML Entity\nReplace the line 'return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";' with 'return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\") + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";' to properly escape the double quote character. This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the issue. However, it may not handle other HTML characters that need to be escaped.",
      "Use a Dedicated HTML Escaping Function\nConsider using a dedicated HTML escaping function, such as org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(), to properly escape all HTML characters in the input string, not just the double quote character. This approach provides a more comprehensive solution, as it will handle other HTML characters that may be present in the input string. The modified function would look like this: 'return \" title=\\\"\" + StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(toolTipText) + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";'.",
      "Use a StringBuilder for Efficient String Concatenation and Manual Escaping\nInstead of using the '+' operator for string concatenation, consider using a StringBuilder to efficiently build the output string. Additionally, manually escape the double quote character by replacing it with '&quot;'. This approach can improve performance, especially for large input strings, and provides a simple way to escape the double quote character. The modified function would look like this: \n```java\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nsb.append(\" title=\\\"\");\nsb.append(toolTipText.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\"));\nsb.append(\"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\");\nreturn sb.toString();\n```\nEach of these suggestions provides a distinct approach to resolving the bug, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project."
