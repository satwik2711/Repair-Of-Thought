    "The root cause of this bug is that the function is not properly escaping special characters, specifically double quotes, in the input string. This is causing the generated HTML to be invalid when the input string contains double quotes.": [
      "Replace Double Quotes with HTML Entity\nReplace all double quotes in the input string with their corresponding HTML entity (&quot;). This can be done using the replace method of the String class in Java. The corrected function would look like this: return \" title=\\\"\" + toolTipText.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\") + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";",
      "Use a StringBuilder for Efficient Concatenation and Entity Replacement\nUse a StringBuilder to concatenate the strings instead of using the '+' operator, and also replace double quotes with their HTML entity. This can improve performance when dealing with large input strings. The corrected function would look like this: StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append(\" title=\\\"\"); sb.append(toolTipText.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\")); sb.append(\"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\"); return sb.toString();",
      "Validate Input for Special Characters and Escape Them\nValidate the input string for any special characters and escape them accordingly. In this case, we only need to handle double quotes, but this approach can prevent any potential issues with other special characters in the future. The corrected function would look like this: String escapedText = toolTipText.replace(\"\\\"\", \"&quot;\"); return \" title=\\\"\" + escapedText + \"\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"\";"
