At\n* offset transitions (due to DST or other historical changes), ranges of\n* local times may map to different UTC times.\n* <p>\n* This method will return an offset suitable for calculating an instant\n* after any DST gap. For example, consider a zone with a cutover\n* from 01:00 to 01:59:<br />\n* Input: 00:00  Output: 00:00<br />\n* Input: 00:30  Output: 00:30<br />\n* Input: 01:00  Output: 02:00<br />\n* Input: 01:30  Output: 02:30<br />\n* Input: 02:00  Output: 02:00<br />\n* Input: 02:30  Output: 02:30<br />\n* <p>\n* During a DST overlap (where the local time is ambiguous) this method will return\n* the earlier instant.
