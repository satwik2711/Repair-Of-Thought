    "The issue lies in the way the function handles the deserialization of properties when the creator has multiple parameters. When the creator has multiple parameters, the function is not correctly buffering the properties, resulting in some properties being lost during the deserialization process.": [
      "Buffer Properties Before Creating the Bean\nOne potential fix is to buffer all properties before creating the bean. This can be done by moving the code that creates the bean to after the loop that buffers the properties. This will ensure that all properties are correctly buffered before the bean is created. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\n// ...\n\n// We hit END_OBJECT, so:\nObject bean;\n// Buffer all properties before creating the bean\nbuffer.bufferAllProperties(p, ctxt);\ntry {\n    bean = creator.build(ctxt, buffer);\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n}\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n```",
      "Use a Separate Buffer for Creator Properties\nAnother potential fix is to use a separate buffer for creator properties. This will allow us to correctly handle the deserialization of creator properties, even when the creator has multiple parameters. We can create a new buffer specifically for creator properties and use it to buffer the properties before creating the bean. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\n// ...\n\n// Create a separate buffer for creator properties\nPropertyValueBuffer creatorBuffer = new PropertyValueBuffer();\n\n// ...\n\n// Buffer creator properties\nif (creatorProp != null) {\n    creatorBuffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt));\n}\n\n// ...\n\n// We hit END_OBJECT, so:\nObject bean;\ntry {\n    bean = creator.build(ctxt, creatorBuffer);\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n}\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n```",
      "Modify the Creator to Use a Builder\nA third potential fix is to modify the creator to use a builder. This will allow us to correctly handle the deserialization of properties, even when the creator has multiple parameters. We can modify the creator to use a builder pattern, which will allow us to buffer the properties before creating the bean. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\n// ...\n\n// Modify the creator to use a builder\npublic class Creator {\n    private Builder builder;\n\n    public Creator(Builder builder) {\n        this.builder = builder;\n    }\n\n    public Object build(DeserializationContext ctxt, PropertyValueBuffer buffer) {\n        // Use the builder to create the bean\n        return builder.build(ctxt, buffer);\n    }\n}\n\n// ...\n\n// We hit END_OBJECT, so:\nObject bean;\ntry {\n    bean = creator.build(ctxt, buffer);\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    return wrapInstantiationProblem(e, ctxt);\n}\nreturn _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);\n```"
