    "The issue lies in the `setOptions` method of the `Parser` class. When the `Options` instance is reused, the `requiredOptions` field is not updated correctly. This is because the `requiredOptions` field is set to the result of `options.getRequiredOptions()` only once, when the `Options` instance is first set. If the `Options` instance is modified later (e.g., by adding or removing required options), the `requiredOptions` field will not reflect these changes. As a result, the parser will not correctly enforce the required options when reusing the same `Options` instance.": [
      "Update `requiredOptions` on Each `setOptions` Call\nUpdate the `setOptions` method to update the `requiredOptions` field every time it is called, rather than just once when the `Options` instance is first set. This can be achieved by moving the line `this.requiredOptions = options.getRequiredOptions();` inside the `setOptions` method.",
      "Use a Defensive Copy of `requiredOptions`\nCreate a defensive copy of the `requiredOptions` field in the `setOptions` method, to ensure that any changes to the `Options` instance do not affect the parser's behavior. This can be achieved by replacing the line `this.requiredOptions = options.getRequiredOptions();` with `this.requiredOptions = new ArrayList<>(options.getRequiredOptions());`.",
      "Clear `requiredOptions` Before Parsing\nClear the `requiredOptions` field before parsing the command line, to ensure that any previous required options are not enforced. This can be achieved by adding the line `this.requiredOptions.clear();` at the beginning of the `parse` method.\n\n\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
