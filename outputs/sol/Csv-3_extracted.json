    "The root cause of the bug is that the `readEscape` function does not correctly handle the escape sequence for the character 'a'. The function does not have a specific case for 'a' in the switch statement, and the default case simply returns the character 'a' without any modification. This results in the escape sequence being lost, and the character 'a' being treated as a literal character.": [
      "Add a Specific Case for 'a'\nAdd a new case to the switch statement to handle the character 'a'. This case should return the ASCII value of the character 'a' (which is 7). This will ensure that the escape sequence for 'a' is correctly handled.",
      "Use a Lookup Table\nInstead of using a switch statement, consider using a lookup table to map characters to their corresponding escape sequences. This would allow for more flexibility and easier maintenance of the function. The lookup table could be a simple array or a HashMap, where the key is the character and the value is the corresponding escape sequence.",
      "Modify the Default Case\nModify the default case to throw an exception or return an error value when an unknown character is encountered. This would prevent the function from silently ignoring unknown characters and would provide a clear indication of an error. Additionally, consider adding a comment to the default case to indicate that it is intended to handle unknown characters.\n\n\",\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
