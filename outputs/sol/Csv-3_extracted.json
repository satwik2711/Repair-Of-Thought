    "The readEscape function does not have a specific case to handle the 'N' character as a special escape sequence for MySQL's null value. The function is currently returning the character 'N' as is, without treating it as an escape sequence.": [
      "Add a New Case for 'N'\nAdd a new case to the switch statement to handle the 'N' character as a special escape sequence for MySQL's null value. For example: \n```java\ncase 'N':\n    return NULL_VALUE;\n```\nThis would require defining a constant NULL_VALUE to represent the null value in MySQL.",
      "Modify the Default Case\nModify the default case to check if the character is 'N' and return the corresponding null value. For example: \n```java\ndefault:\n    if (c == 'N') {\n        return NULL_VALUE;\n    } else {\n        return END_OF_STREAM; // or throw an exception\n    }\n```\nThis approach would handle the 'N' character without adding a new case to the switch statement.",
      "Introduce a Separate Handling for MySQL Null\nIntroduce a separate handling for the MySQL null value by checking for the 'N' character after the switch statement. For example: \n```java\nif (c == 'N') {\n    return NULL_VALUE;\n} else {\n    switch (c) {\n        // existing cases\n    }\n}\n```\nThis approach would handle the 'N' character as a special case outside of the existing switch statement, allowing for more flexibility in handling MySQL-specific escape sequences."
