    "The issue lies in the way the `startIndex` and `endIndex` are calculated. When the `start` or `end` date is not found in the time series, the `getIndex` method returns a negative value, which is then adjusted to point to the first item after the `start` or `end` date. However, this adjustment is not correct when the `start` or `end` date is before the first item or after the last item in the time series. This leads to incorrect indexing and ultimately causes the `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown.": [
      "Correct Indexing Logic\nWe can modify the `startIndex` and `endIndex` calculation to correctly handle the case when the `start` or `end` date is not found in the time series. We can use the `indexOf` method to find the index of the first item that is greater than or equal to the `start` date, and the index of the last item that is less than or equal to the `end` date. The corrected code will be:\n```java\nint startIndex = this.data.indexOf(new TimeSeriesDataItem(start, null));\nif (startIndex < 0) {\n    startIndex = -startIndex - 1;\n}\nint endIndex = this.data.indexOf(new TimeSeriesDataItem(end, null));\nif (endIndex < 0) {\n    endIndex = -endIndex - 2;\n}\n```",
      "Use Binary Search\nWe can use a binary search algorithm to find the correct index for the `start` and `end` dates. This will improve the performance of the `createCopy` function, especially for large time series. We can implement a binary search method that takes the `start` or `end` date as input and returns the correct index.",
      "Handle Edge Cases\nWe can add additional checks to handle edge cases, such as when the `start` or `end` date is before the first item or after the last item in the time series. This will ensure that the `createCopy` function behaves correctly in all scenarios. We can add checks to handle these edge cases and adjust the `startIndex` and `endIndex` accordingly."
