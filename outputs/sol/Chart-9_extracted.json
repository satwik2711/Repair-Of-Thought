    "The root cause of the error lies in the comparison of the start and end dates in the createCopy method. When the start or end dates are not present in the original time series, the method does not correctly calculate the start and end indices, leading to an 'IllegalArgumentException' being thrown with the message 'Requires start <= end'. This issue arises because the method checks if the start date is on or before the end date using the compareTo method, but it does not account for cases where the start or end dates are not in the time series.": [
      "Adjust Start and End Index Calculation\nAdjust the start and end index calculations to find the closest date in the time series that is on or before the given start and end dates. This can be achieved by iterating through the time series data to find the appropriate indices. The adjusted method would first find the index of the start date, and if it's not found, it would find the index of the last date that is before the start date. Similarly, it would find the index of the end date, and if it's not found, it would find the index of the last date that is before the end date.",
      "Handle Boundary Cases\nExplicitly handle boundary cases where the start or end date is equal to the first or last date in the time series. This can be done by adding conditional statements to check if the start date is before the first date in the time series or if the end date is after the last date in the time series. If the start date is before the first date, the method should return an empty time series. If the end date is after the last date, the method should set the end index to the last index of the time series.",
      "Modify Comparison Logic and Index Calculation\nModify the comparison logic to check if the start date is after the end date, considering the cases where the start or end dates are not in the time series. If the start date is after the end date, throw an 'IllegalArgumentException' with a clear message. Then, calculate the start and end indices based on the adjusted comparison logic. This can be achieved by using a binary search approach to find the indices of the start and end dates in the time series, ensuring that the start index is always less than or equal to the end index."
