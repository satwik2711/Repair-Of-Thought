    "The root cause of the bug is that the `clone()` method is not creating a deep copy of the class names. Instead, it is creating a shallow copy, which means that both the original and cloned objects are referencing the same `classNames` set. When the cloned object's class names are modified, the original object's class names are also modified, causing the test to fail.": [
      "Create a Deep Copy of Class Names\nWe can create a deep copy of the class names by using the `new HashSet<>()` constructor to create a new `classNames` set in the cloned object, and then copying the class names from the original object's `classNames` set to the new set using the `addAll()` method. This approach ensures that the cloned object has its own independent set of class names, which can be modified without affecting the original object.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames = new HashSet<>(classNames);\n    return clone;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Copy Constructor\nAlternatively, we can use a copy constructor to create a deep copy of the class names. We can create a new `Element` object and pass the original object's `classNames` set to the constructor, which will create a deep copy of the class names. This approach is more explicit and can be more efficient than creating a new set and copying the elements.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = new Element(this);\n    return clone;\n}\n\n// Assuming a copy constructor is defined in the Element class\npublic Element(Element original) {\n    this.classNames = new HashSet<>(original.classNames);\n}\n```",
      "Use a Defensive Copy\nAnother approach is to use a defensive copy to create a deep copy of the class names. We can create a new `classNames` set in the cloned object and copy the class names from the original object's `classNames` set to the new set using the `addAll()` method. However, instead of using the `new HashSet<>()` constructor, we can use the `Collections.unmodifiableSet()` method to create an unmodifiable set, which ensures that the cloned object's class names cannot be modified accidentally.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames = Collections.unmodifiableSet(new HashSet<>(classNames));\n    return clone;\n}\n```"
