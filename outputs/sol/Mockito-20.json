This can be done by adding a check for the `useConstructor` setting in the `createMock` function and calling the `MockMethodInterceptor` accordingly.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Different Instantiator\nUse a different instantiator that can handle the case when the mock object is created with a constructor. This can be done by modifying the `classInstantiator` to use a different instantiator that can handle constructors.\n\nSuggestion 3: Modify the Mock Creation Settings\nModify the mock creation settings to include the constructor parameters. This can be done by adding a new setting to the `MockCreationSettings` class to include the constructor parameters.\n\nHere is an example of how the `createMock` function can be modified to initialize the mock object with the constructor:\n\n```java\npublic <T> T createMock(MockCreationSettings<T> settings, MockHandler handler) {\n    if (settings.getSerializableMode() == SerializableMode.ACROSS_CLASSLOADERS) {\n        throw new MockitoException(\"Serialization across classloaders not yet supported with ByteBuddyMockMaker\");\n    }\n    Class<? extends T> mockedProxyType = cachingMockBytecodeGenerator.get(\n            settings.getTypeToMock(),\n            settings.getExtraInterfaces()\n    );\n    T mockInstance = null;\n    try {\n        if (settings.useConstructor()) {\n            // Initialize the mock object with the constructor\n            mockInstance = classInstantiator.instantiate(mockedProxyType, settings.getConstructorArgs());\n        } else {\n            mockInstance = classInstantiator.instantiate(mockedProxyType);\n        }\n        MockMethodInterceptor.MockAccess mockAccess = (MockMethodInterceptor.MockAccess) mockInstance;\n        mockAccess.setMockitoInterceptor(new MockMethodInterceptor(asInternalMockHandler(handler), settings));\n\n        return ensureMockIsAssignableToMockedType(settings, mockInstance);\n    } catch (ClassCastException cce) {\n        throw new MockitoException(join(\n                \"ClassCastException occurred while creating the mockito mock :\",\n                \"  class to mock : \" + describeClass(mockedProxyType),\n                \"  created class : \" + describeClass(settings.getTypeToMock()),\n                \"  proxy instance class : \" + describeClass(mockInstance),\n                \"  instance creation by : \" + classInstantiator.getClass().getSimpleName(),\n                \"\",\n                \"You might experience classloading issues, please ask the mockito mailing-list.\",\n                \"\"\n        ),cce);\n    } catch (org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.InstantiationException e) {\n        throw new MockitoException(\"Unable to create mock instance of type '\" + mockedProxyType.getSuperclass().getSimpleName() + \"'\", e);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the above code is just an example and may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of the project.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"\"\n}",

This can be done by modifying the `classInstantiator` to use a different instantiator that can handle constructors.
