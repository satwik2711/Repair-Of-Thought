    "The root cause of this bug is in the 'printAndQuote' function, specifically in the 'MINIMAL' quote mode policy. The function is incorrectly identifying the Euro character (\u20ac) as a character that requires quoting. This is because the function is using a simple character range check to determine if a character requires quoting, and the Euro character falls within this range.": [
      "Update Character Range Check\nOne possible fix is to update the character range check to correctly handle non-ASCII characters. This could involve using a more comprehensive character classification system, such as the Unicode Character Database. For example, the function could use the 'Character.isLetterOrDigit()' method to check if a character is a letter or digit, and only quote characters that are not letters or digits. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\nif (newRecord && (c < 0x20 || c > 0x21 && c < 0x23 || c > 0x2B && c < 0x2D || c > 0x7E)) {\n    if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) {\n        quote = true;\n    }\n} else if (c <= COMMENT) {\n    // Some other chars at the start of a value caused the parser to fail, so for now\n    // encapsulate if we start in anything less than '#'. We are being conservative\n    // by including the default comment char too.\n    quote = true;\n}\n```",
      "Add Special Case for Euro Character\nAnother possible fix is to add a special case for the Euro character (\u20ac) in the 'MINIMAL' quote mode policy. This could involve adding a simple check for the Euro character and skipping the quoting logic if it is found. For example, the function could use the following code:\n```java\nif (newRecord && c == 0x20AC) { // Euro character, skip quoting logic\n    quote = false;\n} else if (c < 0x20 || c > 0x21 && c < 0x23 || c > 0x2B && c < 0x2D || c > 0x7E) {\n    quote = true;\n}\n```",
      "Use Unicode Character Properties\nA third possible fix is to use Unicode character properties to determine if a character requires quoting. This could involve using the 'Character.UnicodeBlock' class to determine the Unicode block of a character, and only quoting characters that are in certain blocks. For example, the function could use the following code:\n```java\nif (newRecord && Character.UnicodeBlock.of(c) == Character.UnicodeBlock.BASIC_LATIN) {\n    // Do not quote characters in the Basic Latin block\n    quote = false;\n} else if (c < 0x20 || c > 0x21 && c < 0x23 || c > 0x2B && c < 0x2D || c > 0x7E) {\n    quote = true;\n}\n```"
