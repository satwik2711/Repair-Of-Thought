The function `solve` is supposed to find the root of a univariate real function `f` within the interval `[min, max]` with an initial guess `initial`. However, the function is currently not using the provided `f`, `min`, `max`, and `initial` parameters correctly, leading to a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the `f` function.

The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, double min, double max, double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n    double a = min;\n    double b = max;\n    double fa = f.value(a);\n    double fb = f.value(b);\n    if (fa * fb > 0) {\n        throw new FunctionEvaluationException(\"The function must have different signs at the endpoints of the interval.\");\n    }\n    while (b - a > getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n        double c = (a + b) / 2;\n        double fc = f.value(c);\n        if (fc * fa < 0) {\n            b = c;\n            fb = fc;\n        } else {\n            a = c;\n            fa = fc;\n        }\n    }\n    return (a + b) / 2;\n}\n```\nThis solution correctly implements the bisection algorithm and should fix the bug.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a Different Solver\nIf the `BisectionSolver` class is not correctly implemented, it might be better to use a different solver, such as the `BrentSolver` or `NewtonRaphsonSolver` classes provided by the Apache Commons Math library.
