      "Initialize headerMap in the CSVParser constructor\nThe `headerMap` field can be initialized in the `CSVParser` constructor when the CSV string is parsed. This ensures that the `headerMap` field is populated before it is used in the `getHeaderMap` method. However, this approach requires modifying the `CSVParser` constructor, which may not be desirable.",
      "Check for null before creating a new LinkedHashMap\nThe `getHeaderMap` method can be modified to check if the `headerMap` field is null before creating a new `LinkedHashMap`. If the `headerMap` field is null, the method can return an empty map or throw a custom exception. This approach is simple and efficient, but it may not provide the desired behavior if the `headerMap` field is intentionally null.",
      "Initialize headerMap lazily\nThe `headerMap` field can be initialized lazily in the `getHeaderMap` method. This ensures that the `headerMap` field is populated only when it is needed, and avoids the need to initialize it in the `CSVParser` constructor. This approach is efficient and provides the desired behavior, but it requires modifying the `getHeaderMap` method to handle the lazy initialization.\n\nHere is the modified code for",

It also handles the case where the `headerMap` field is null, and provides a clear and concise solution to the bug."
