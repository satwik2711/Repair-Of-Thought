    "The root cause of the bug is that the function getMatchingOptions is returning all options that start with the specified partial name, without considering whether the match is exact or not. This is causing the parser to throw an AmbiguousOptionException when it encounters multiple options that match the partial name.": [
      "Exact Match Only\nModify the function to return only the options that exactly match the specified partial name. This can be done by checking if the length of the long option is equal to the length of the partial name, in addition to checking if it starts with the partial name. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic List<String> getMatchingOptions(String opt)\n{\n    opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(opt);\n    \n    List<String> matchingOpts = new ArrayList<String>();\n\n    for (String longOpt : longOpts.keySet())\n    {\n        if (longOpt.equals(opt))\n        {\n            matchingOpts.add(longOpt);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return matchingOpts;\n}\n```",
      "Return Single Exact Match\nModify the function to return only the first option that exactly matches the specified partial name. This can be done by breaking out of the loop as soon as an exact match is found. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic List<String> getMatchingOptions(String opt)\n{\n    opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(opt);\n    \n    List<String> matchingOpts = new ArrayList<String>();\n\n    for (String longOpt : longOpts.keySet())\n    {\n        if (longOpt.equals(opt))\n        {\n            matchingOpts.add(longOpt);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return matchingOpts;\n}\n```",
      "Ignore Partial Matches\nModify the function to ignore partial matches and only return options that exactly match the specified partial name. This can be done by checking if the long option is equal to the partial name, instead of checking if it starts with the partial name. Here is the modified code:\n```java\npublic List<String> getMatchingOptions(String opt)\n{\n    opt = Util.stripLeadingHyphens(opt);\n    \n    List<String> matchingOpts = new ArrayList<String>();\n\n    for (String longOpt : longOpts.keySet())\n    {\n        if (longOpt.equals(opt))\n        {\n            matchingOpts.add(longOpt);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return matchingOpts;\n}\n```\nNote that Suggestion 1 and Suggestion 3 are essentially the same, as they both check for exact matches. However, I have included both suggestions to provide different perspectives on the solution."
