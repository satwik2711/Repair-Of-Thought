The function `_serializeXmlNull` is supposed to serialize a null value to XML. The trigger test `testDynamicRootName` tests this function by writing a null value to XML with a custom root name 'rudy'. However, the actual output is '<null/>' instead of the expected '<rudy/>'.

This approach assumes that the `JsonGenerator` is always an instance of `ObjectWriter`. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprotected void _serializeXmlNull(JsonGenerator jgen) throws IOException\n{\n    ((ObjectWriter) jgen).withRootName(ROOT_NAME_FOR_NULL);\n    super.serializeValue(jgen, null);\n}\n```\nNote that this approach may throw a `ClassCastException` if the `JsonGenerator` is not an instance of `ObjectWriter`.",
