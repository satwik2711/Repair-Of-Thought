    "The root cause of the bug is that the function doSolve() does not properly handle the case when the function value accuracy is too small, causing the algorithm to enter an infinite loop. This is because the condition to check if the function value of the last approximation is too small is not sufficient, and the algorithm does not throw a TooManyEvaluationsException when it should.": [
      "Add a Maximum Iteration Count\nOne possible fix is to add a maximum iteration count to the while loop in the doSolve() function. This will prevent the algorithm from entering an infinite loop when the function value accuracy is too small. We can add a counter variable and increment it each time the loop iterates. If the counter exceeds a certain threshold, we can throw a TooManyEvaluationsException.\n\n```java\n// Add a maximum iteration count\nint maxIterations = 100;\nint iterationCount = 0;\n\nwhile (true) {\n    // ...\n\n    iterationCount++;\n\n    if (iterationCount > maxIterations) {\n        throw new TooManyEvaluationsException();\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Improve the Function Value Accuracy Check\nAnother possible fix is to improve the function value accuracy check in the doSolve() function. Instead of just checking if the absolute value of the function value is less than or equal to the function value accuracy, we can also check if the relative difference between the current function value and the previous function value is less than or equal to the function value accuracy. This will help to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\n```java\n// Improve the function value accuracy check\nif (FastMath.abs(f1) <= ftol || FastMath.abs(f1 - f0) / FastMath.abs(f1) <= ftol) {\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Convergence Criterion\nA third possible fix is to use a more robust convergence criterion that takes into account the relative difference between the current approximation and the previous approximation. This will help to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite loop when the function value accuracy is too small.\n\n```java\n// Use a more robust convergence criterion\nif (FastMath.abs(x1 - x0) < FastMath.max(rtol * FastMath.abs(x1), atol) || FastMath.abs(x1 - x0) / FastMath.abs(x1) <= rtol) {\n    // ...\n}\n```"
