    "The root cause of the bug is that the `isInlinableObject` function is not correctly handling cases where the object literal has a property that is not defined on the object. The function is returning `false` prematurely when it encounters a property that is not defined on the object, instead of continuing to check the rest of the properties.": [
      "Relax the Property Check\nOne possible fix is to relax the property check in the `isInlinableObject` function. Instead of returning `false` immediately when a property is not defined on the object, we can continue to check the rest of the properties. This would allow the function to correctly handle cases where the object literal has a property that is not defined on the object. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\n// Only rewrite VAR declarations or simple assignment statements\nif (!isVarOrAssignExprLhs(name)) {\n    continue;\n}\n\n// ...\n\n// We're looking for object literal assignments only.\nif (!val.isObjectLit()) {\n    continue;\n}\n\n// ...\n```\nBy changing the `return false` statements to `continue` statements, we allow the function to continue checking the rest of the properties, even if one property is not defined on the object.",
      "Add a Special Case for Undefined Properties\nAnother possible fix is to add a special case for undefined properties in the `isInlinableObject` function. We can add a check for undefined properties and handle them separately. This would allow the function to correctly handle cases where the object literal has a property that is not defined on the object. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\n// ...\n\n// Make sure that the value is not self-refential. IOW,\n// disallow things like x = {b: x.a}.\n//\n// ...\nfor (Node child = val.getFirstChild(); child != null;\n     child = child.getNext()) {\n    // ...\n    Node childVal = child.getFirstChild();\n    if (childVal == null) {\n        // Handle undefined properties separately\n        continue;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nBy adding a special case for undefined properties, we can ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the object literal has a property that is not defined on the object.",
      "Modify the Property Check to Use a More Relaxed Definition\nA third possible fix is to modify the property check in the `isInlinableObject` function to use a more relaxed definition. Instead of checking if the property is defined on the object literal, we can check if the property is defined on the object or its prototype chain. This would allow the function to correctly handle cases where the object literal has a property that is not defined on the object but is defined on its prototype chain. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\n// ...\n\n// We're looking for object literal assignments only.\nif (!val.isObjectLit()) {\n    // Check if the property is defined on the object or its prototype chain\n    if (!val.hasProperty(name)) {\n        continue;\n    }\n}\n```\nBy modifying the property check to use a more relaxed definition, we can ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the object literal has a property that is not defined on the object but is defined on its prototype chain."
