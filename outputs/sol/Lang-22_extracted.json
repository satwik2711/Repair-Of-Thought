    "The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of integer overflow in the `greatestCommonDivisor` function. When the input numbers are large, the function may overflow when calculating the GCD, resulting in incorrect results. Specifically, the issue occurs when the input numbers are `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and a small number, such as 2. In this case, the function overflows when calculating the GCD, resulting in an incorrect result.": [
      "Handle Integer Overflow Explicitly\nModify the `greatestCommonDivisor` function to explicitly check for integer overflow and handle it accordingly. This can be done by adding checks for overflow before calculating the GCD. For example, before calculating `u/2` or `v/2`, check if the result would overflow and handle it accordingly. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate static int greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v) {\n    // ...\n    if (k == 31) {\n        if (u < 0) {\n            u = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n        } else {\n            u = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n        }\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Algorithm\nModify the `greatestCommonDivisor` function to use a different algorithm that avoids overflow, such as the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm uses the remainder of the division of the two numbers to calculate the GCD, which avoids the overflow issue. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate static int greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v) {\n    if (u == 0) {\n        return v;\n    } else if (v == 0) {\n        return u;\n    } else {\n        int r = u % v;\n        return greatestCommonDivisor(v, r);\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Reduce Input Numbers Before Calculating GCD\nModify the `greatestCommonDivisor` function to reduce the input numbers before calculating the GCD. This can be done by dividing both numbers by 2 until they are within a safe range. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate static int greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v) {\n    // ...\n    if (Math.abs(u) > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2 || Math.abs(v) > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2) {\n        u = u / 2;\n        v = v / 2;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```"
