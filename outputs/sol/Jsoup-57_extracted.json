    "The `ConcurrentModificationException` occurs because we're trying to remove an attribute from the `attributes` map while iterating over its keys using an `Iterator`. This is not allowed because the iterator is designed to fail-fast, meaning it will throw an exception if the underlying collection is modified structurally while the iterator is still active. In this case, the `remove` method modifies the `attributes` map, causing the iterator to fail.": [
      "Using an Iterator's Remove Method\nInstead of calling `attributes.remove(attrKey)` directly, we can use the `Iterator`'s `remove` method to safely remove the attribute from the map. This method is designed to work with the iterator and will not cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`. We can modify the buggy function as follows:\n```java\nfor (Iterator<String> it = attributes.keySet().iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {\n    String attrKey = it.next();\n    if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n        it.remove();\n}\n```\nThis approach is straightforward and efficient, as it avoids the need to create a temporary collection or use a different data structure.",
      "Creating a Temporary Collection\nAnother approach is to create a temporary collection to store the keys to be removed, and then iterate over this collection to remove the attributes from the map. This approach avoids the `ConcurrentModificationException` by not modifying the original map while iterating over it. We can modify the buggy function as follows:\n```java\nList<String> keysToRemove = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (String attrKey : attributes.keySet()) {\n    if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n        keysToRemove.add(attrKey);\n}\nfor (String keyToRemove : keysToRemove) {\n    attributes.remove(keyToRemove);\n}\n```\nThis approach is more verbose than the first suggestion, but it provides a clear and safe way to remove attributes from the map.",
      "Using Java 8's Stream API\nIf we're using Java 8 or later, we can use the Stream API to remove attributes from the map in a concise and safe way. We can modify the buggy function as follows:\n```java\nattributes.keySet().stream()\n    .filter(attrKey -> attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))\n    .forEach(attributes::remove);\n```\nThis approach is more concise than the previous suggestions, but it requires Java 8 or later. It also provides a clear and safe way to remove attributes from the map."
