    "The root cause of the bug is that the `getValue()` function is not handling boolean attributes correctly. In HTML, boolean attributes like `hidden` do not have a value, but the `getValue()` function is returning `null` instead of an empty string.": [
      "Check for Boolean Attributes\nCheck if the attribute is a boolean attribute and return an empty string if it is. This can be done by checking if the attribute value is `null` or an empty string. However, this approach requires additional logic to identify boolean attributes, which may not be feasible in this case.",
      "Use a Default Value\nUse a default value of an empty string if the attribute value is `null`. This can be done by using the ternary operator to return an empty string if the attribute value is `null`. This approach is simple and effective, and it handles boolean attributes correctly by returning an empty string if the attribute value is `null`.",
      "Handle Boolean Attributes Explicitly\nHandle boolean attributes explicitly by checking if the attribute key is a boolean attribute and return an empty string if it is. This can be done by maintaining a list of boolean attributes and checking if the attribute key is in that list. However, this approach requires additional logic and data structures to maintain the list of boolean attributes.\n\nThe final solution is to use",
