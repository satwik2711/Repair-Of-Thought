    "The root cause of the bug is that the `_parseIndex` function does not correctly handle the case where the input string has a leading zero. The function checks for leading zeroes, but it does not correctly handle the case where the input string has a length of 2 or more and starts with a zero.": [
      "Check for Leading Zeroes in All Characters\nOne possible fix is to modify the `_parseIndex` function to check for leading zeroes in all characters, not just the first character. This can be done by adding a loop that checks each character in the input string to see if it is a zero. If a zero is found and it's not the first character, the function can return -1 immediately.",
      "Use a Regular Expression to Validate the Input String\nAnother possible fix is to use a regular expression to validate the input string. The regular expression can be designed to match strings that do not have leading zeroes. If the input string does not match the regular expression, the function can return -1. The regular expression can be `^[1-9][0-9]*$`, which matches strings that start with a digit between 1 and 9, followed by zero or more digits.",
      "Modify the Length Check to Handle Leading Zeroes\nA third possible fix is to modify the length check in the `_parseIndex` function to handle leading zeroes. Instead of checking if the length is greater than 10, the function can check if the length is greater than 1 and if the first character is a zero. If both conditions are true, the function can return -1. This fix is simpler than the first two suggestions, but it may not be as robust."
