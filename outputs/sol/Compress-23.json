This would require significant changes to the code, but it would allow us to handle large dictionary sizes correctly.\n\nSuggestion 3: Throw a More Informative Exception\nWe can modify the `decode` function to throw a more informative exception when the dictionary size is too big for the `LZMAInputStream` implementation.
