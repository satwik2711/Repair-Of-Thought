    "The `getLine()` function is not correctly handling the case where the line number is out of range or the line does not exist. The function returns `null` in such cases, but it does not throw an exception or provide any indication of the error. This is causing the `testSyntaxError2()` test to fail, as it expects a `RuntimeException` to be thrown with a message containing the error details.": [
      "Throw an Exception for Invalid Line Numbers\nThe `getLine()` function should throw a `RuntimeException` with a meaningful error message when the line number is out of range or the line does not exist. This will ensure that the function correctly handles error cases and provides a clear indication of the error to the caller.",
      "Return an Empty String for Non-Existent Lines\nInstead of returning `null` for non-existent lines, the `getLine()` function could return an empty string. This would allow the caller to handle the case where the line does not exist without having to check for `null` values.",
      "Improve Error Handling with a Custom Exception\nThe `getLine()` function could be modified to throw a custom exception (e.g., `LineNumberOutOfRangeException`) when the line number is out of range or the line does not exist. This would provide a more specific and informative error message to the caller, making it easier to handle and debug the error.\n\n\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"}"
