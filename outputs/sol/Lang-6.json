This would ensure that the position `pos` is not incremented beyond the end of the input string. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (pos + 1 < len && Character.isSurrogatePair(input.charAt(pos), input.charAt(pos + 1))) {\n    pos += 2;\n} else {\n    pos += Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n}\n```\nThis fix is similar to Suggestion 1, but it provides an additional check to ensure that the position `pos` is not incremented beyond the end of the input string.",
