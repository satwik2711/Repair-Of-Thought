    "The root cause of the bug is that the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` function is not correctly checking if a node is a function expression. The function is currently using the `NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression` method, which is not sufficient to handle the case where the node is a getter method. The `AstValidator` is expecting a function node, but it's actually getting a call reference node, which is causing the error.": [
      "Check for Call Reference Node\nWe can modify the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` function to check if the node is a call reference node and if its parent is a function expression. If it is, then we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```java\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    if (n instanceof CallReferenceNode && n.getParent() instanceof FunctionExpressionNode) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and efficient, but it may not cover all cases where the node is a getter method.",
      "Check for Getter Method\nAnother possible solution is to check if the node is a getter method. We can do this by checking if the node is a property node and if its key is a string that starts with 'get'. If it is, then we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```java\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    if (n instanceof PropertyNode && n.getKey().startsWith(\"get\")) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n```\nThis solution is more specific to the case where the node is a getter method, but it may not cover all cases where the node is a call reference node.",
      "Combine Both Checks\nWe can also combine both checks to make the function more robust. We can check if the node is a call reference node and if its parent is a function expression, and also check if the node is a getter method. If either of these conditions is true, then we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's an example of how the modified function could look like:\n```java\nprivate static boolean isReduceableFunctionExpression(Node n) {\n    if ((n instanceof CallReferenceNode && n.getParent() instanceof FunctionExpressionNode) || (n instanceof PropertyNode && n.getKey().startsWith(\"get\"))) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);\n}\n```\nThis solution is the most comprehensive and should cover all cases where the node is a function expression or a getter method."
