    "The root cause of the bug is that the `writeBits` function does not properly handle the case where the `length` parameter is a multiple of 8. In this case, the function will not write the last byte of the cache to the output stream, resulting in a truncated header. This is because the condition `if (length > 0 && shift > 0)` is not sufficient to cover this case.": [
      "Add an additional condition to write the last byte of the cache\nWe can add an additional condition to the `if` statement to check if the `length` parameter is a multiple of 8. If it is, we can write the last byte of the cache to the output stream. This can be achieved by modifying the `if` statement as follows:\n```java\nif (length > 0 && (shift > 0 || length % 8 == 0)) {\n    header.write(cache);\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and efficient, and it directly addresses the root cause of the bug.",
      "Use a different caching mechanism\nInstead of using a caching mechanism that writes bits in chunks of 8 bits, we can use a caching mechanism that writes bits in chunks of 1 byte. This would eliminate the need for the `shift` variable and the associated logic. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nint cache = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n    cache = (cache << 1) | (bits.get(i) ? 1 : 0);\n    if ((i + 1) % 8 == 0) {\n        header.write(cache);\n        cache = 0;\n    }\n}\nif (length > 0) {\n    header.write(cache);\n}\n```\nThis solution is more robust and eliminates the need for the `shift` variable, but it may be slightly less efficient than the first suggestion.",
      "Use a more robust caching mechanism with ByteBuffer\nWe can use a more robust caching mechanism that handles the case where the `length` parameter is a multiple of 8. For example, we can use a `ByteBuffer` object to cache the bits and then write the cached bits to the output stream in chunks of 1 byte. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nByteBuffer cache = ByteBuffer.allocate((length + 7) / 8);\nfor (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n    cache.put((byte) (bits.get(i) ? 1 : 0));\n}\ncache.flip();\nwhile (cache.hasRemaining()) {\n    header.write(cache.get());\n}\n```\nThis solution is the most robust and efficient, but it may be slightly more complex than the first two suggestions."
