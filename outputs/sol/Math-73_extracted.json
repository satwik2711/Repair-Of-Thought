    "The `solve` method is not correctly handling non-bracketing intervals because it's not checking if the initial guess is within the interval defined by the two endpoints. The method is only checking if the initial guess is between the minimum and maximum values, but it's not considering the case where the initial guess is outside the interval defined by the two endpoints.": [
      "Add a new method to check if the initial guess is within the interval defined by the two endpoints.\nThis method can be called at the beginning of the `solve` method to ensure that the initial guess is valid. If the initial guess is not within the interval, an `IllegalArgumentException` can be thrown. The new method can be implemented as follows:\n```java\nprivate void verifyInitialGuess(double min, double max, double initial) {\n    if (initial < min || initial > max) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Initial guess is not within the interval\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method can be called at the beginning of the `solve` method:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f,\n                    final double min, final double max, final double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n\n    clearResult();\n    verifySequence(min, initial, max);\n    verifyInitialGuess(min, max, initial);\n    // ... rest of the method remains the same ...\n}\n```",
      "Modify the `solve` method to handle non-bracketing intervals correctly.\nThis can be done by adding a check to see if the initial guess is within the interval defined by the two endpoints. If it's not, the method can return an error or throw an exception. The modified method can be implemented as follows:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f,\n                    final double min, final double max, final double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n\n    clearResult();\n    verifySequence(min, initial, max);\n\n    if (initial < min || initial > max) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Initial guess is not within the interval\");\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of the method remains the same ...\n}\n```",
      "Add additional error checking to handle edge cases and potential issues.\nThis can include checking if the initial guess is exactly equal to one of the endpoints, or if the function is not continuous within the interval. The additional error checking can be implemented as follows:\n```java\npublic double solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f,\n                    final double min, final double max, final double initial)\n    throws MaxIterationsExceededException, FunctionEvaluationException {\n\n    clearResult();\n    verifySequence(min, initial, max);\n\n    if (initial < min || initial > max) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Initial guess is not within the interval\");\n    }\n\n    if (initial == min || initial == max) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Initial guess is equal to one of the endpoints\");\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of the method remains the same ...\n}\n```"
