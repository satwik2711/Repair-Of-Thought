    "The issue lies in the fact that the `Calendar` object is not being set to the correct locale before calculating the week number. The `GregorianCalendar` object is created with the `mTimeZone` field, but it is not clear if this field is set to the correct locale. Additionally, the `Calendar` object is not being set to the correct first day of the week and minimum days in first week for the Swedish locale. In Sweden, the first day of the week is Monday and the minimum days in the first week is 4.": [
      "Set Calendar to Correct Locale\nOne potential fix is to set the `Calendar` object to the correct locale before calculating the week number. This can be done by calling the `setLocale` method on the `Calendar` object before setting the time. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nCalendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\nc.setLocale(locale);\nc.setTime(date);\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\nThis fix assumes that the `locale` field is set to the correct locale for the date being formatted.",
      "Set First Day of Week and Minimum Days in First Week\nAnother potential fix is to set the first day of the week and minimum days in the first week for the Swedish locale. This can be done by calling the `setFirstDayOfWeek` and `setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek` methods on the `Calendar` object before calculating the week number. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nCalendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);\nc.setFirstDayOfWeek(Calendar.MONDAY);\nc.setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(4);\nc.setTime(date);\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\nThis fix assumes that the first day of the week is Monday and the minimum days in the first week is 4 for the Swedish locale.",
      "Use Locale-Specific Calendar\nA third potential fix is to use a locale-specific `Calendar` object instead of a `GregorianCalendar` object. This can be done by calling the `Calendar.getInstance` method with the correct locale. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nCalendar c = Calendar.getInstance(locale);\nc.setTime(date);\nreturn applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();\n```\nThis fix assumes that the `locale` field is set to the correct locale for the date being formatted."
