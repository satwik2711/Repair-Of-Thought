    "The root cause of the bug is that the findNameForSerialization function is returning null when it encounters an object that has the JsonSerialize, JsonView, or JsonRawValue annotation but does not have the JsonGetter or JsonProperty annotation. This is because the function is returning an empty string in this case, which is not a valid property name. As a result, the serializer is not able to discover any properties for the Outer class, leading to the error message.": [
      "Return a Default Property Name\nOne possible fix is to return a default property name when the findNameForSerialization function encounters an object that has the JsonSerialize, JsonView, or JsonRawValue annotation but does not have the JsonGetter or JsonProperty annotation. For example, we could return the name of the field that contains the object. This can be achieved by modifying the findNameForSerialization function as follows:\n```java\npublic PropertyName findNameForSerialization(Annotated a) {\n    String name = null;\n\n    JsonGetter jg = _findAnnotation(a, JsonGetter.class);\n    if (jg != null) {\n        name = jg.value();\n    } else {\n        JsonProperty pann = _findAnnotation(a, JsonProperty.class);\n        if (pann != null) {\n            name = pann.value();\n        } else if (_hasAnnotation(a, JsonSerialize.class)\n                || _hasAnnotation(a, JsonView.class)\n                || _hasAnnotation(a, JsonRawValue.class)) {\n            name = a.getName(); // Return the name of the field\n        } else {\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n    return PropertyName.construct(name);\n}\n```",
      "Ignore the JsonSerialize, JsonView, and JsonRawValue Annotations\nAnother possible fix is to ignore the JsonSerialize, JsonView, and JsonRawValue annotations when they are present on an object that does not have the JsonGetter or JsonProperty annotation. This would allow the serializer to discover the properties of the Outer class based on its fields. This can be achieved by modifying the findNameForSerialization function as follows:\n```java\npublic PropertyName findNameForSerialization(Annotated a) {\n    String name = null;\n\n    JsonGetter jg = _findAnnotation(a, JsonGetter.class);\n    if (jg != null) {\n        name = jg.value();\n    } else {\n        JsonProperty pann = _findAnnotation(a, JsonProperty.class);\n        if (pann != null) {\n            name = pann.value();\n        } else {\n            // Ignore the JsonSerialize, JsonView, and JsonRawValue annotations\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n    return PropertyName.construct(name);\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Annotation\nA third possible fix is to use a different annotation, such as JsonUnwrapped, to indicate that the Inner object should be serialized as a property of the Outer object. This would allow the serializer to discover the properties of the Outer class based on the annotations present on the Inner object. This can be achieved by modifying the Outer class as follows:\n```java\npublic class Outer {\n    @JsonUnwrapped\n    public Inner inner;\n}\n```\nThis would allow the serializer to discover the properties of the Inner object and serialize them as properties of the Outer object."
