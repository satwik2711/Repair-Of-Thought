    "The root cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the Byte Order Mark (BOM) when no charset is specified. The function attempts to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags, but it does not correctly handle the case where the BOM is present. The function incorrectly decodes the byte data using the default charset, which results in an incorrect parsing of the HTML.": [
      "Check for BOM Before Decoding\nOne potential fix is to check for the presence of a BOM before decoding the byte data. If a BOM is present, we can skip it before decoding the rest of the data. This can be done by checking the first few bytes of the data for the BOM signature (0xFEFF for UTF-16, 0xFFFE for UTF-16BE, 0xEFBBBF for UTF-8). If a BOM is found, we can skip it and then decode the rest of the data using the detected charset.",
      "Use a More Robust Charset Detection Method\nAnother potential fix is to use a more robust charset detection method. The current implementation relies on detecting the charset from the HTML meta tags, which may not always be present or accurate. A more robust approach would be to use a library such as juniversalchardet, which can detect the charset from the byte data itself. This would allow us to correctly detect the charset even in the presence of a BOM.",
      "Handle BOM in Charset Detection\nA third potential fix is to modify the charset detection method to handle the BOM correctly. This can be done by checking for the presence of a BOM in the byte data and skipping it before detecting the charset. This would allow us to correctly detect the charset even in the presence of a BOM. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM\n    if (byteData.remaining() > 0 && byteData.get() == (byte) 0xFEFF) {\n        byteData.position(byteData.position() + 1);\n    }\n    // Detect charset from byte data\n    docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis code checks for the presence of a BOM at the beginning of the byte data and skips it if found. It then detects the charset from the byte data using the default charset."
