    "The root cause of the bug is that the `codes` array is not large enough to accommodate characters with values greater than or equal to the length of the array. This is because the `codes` array is initialized with a fixed size, and the function does not check if the character value is within the bounds of the array before attempting to access it.": [
      "Increase the Size of the Codes Array\nOne possible fix is to increase the size of the `codes` array to accommodate characters with values up to 256. This can be done by initializing the array with a larger size, for example: `int[] codes = new int[256];`. This would ensure that the array is large enough to accommodate all possible character values.",
      "Add Bounds Checking\nAnother possible fix is to add bounds checking to the function to ensure that the character value is within the bounds of the `codes` array before attempting to access it. This can be done by adding a simple check, for example: `if (i >= codes.length) { throw new RuntimeException(\"Character value out of range\"); }`. This would prevent the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` from being thrown and provide a more informative error message.",
      "Use a Larger Data Structure\nA third possible fix is to use a larger data structure, such as a `HashMap`, to store the codes instead of an array. This would allow the function to accommodate characters with values greater than or equal to the length of the array without having to worry about bounds checking. For example: `HashMap<Integer, Integer> codes = new HashMap<>();`. This would provide a more flexible and scalable solution."
