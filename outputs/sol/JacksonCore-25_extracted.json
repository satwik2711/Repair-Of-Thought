    "The root cause of the bug is that the codes array is not large enough to handle characters with values greater than its length. In the trigger test, the input buffer contains a character with a value of 256, which is out of the range of the codes array. When the function tries to access the codes array with this index, it throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The bug is caused by the fact that the codes array is not initialized with a large enough size to handle all possible character values.": [
      "Increase the Size of the Codes Array\nOne possible fix is to increase the size of the codes array to a value that is large enough to handle all possible character values. For example, we could initialize the codes array with a size of 512 or 1024. This would ensure that the array is large enough to handle characters with values up to 511 or 1023, respectively. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nfinal int maxCode = 512; // or 1024\nint[] codes = new int[maxCode];\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, and it does not introduce any new issues.",
      "Use a Larger Data Type for the Codes Array\nAnother possible fix is to use a larger data type for the codes array, such as an array of integers instead of an array of bytes. This would allow us to handle characters with values up to 65535, which is the maximum value that can be represented by a 16-bit unsigned integer. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nint[] codes = new int[256]; // or a larger size\n```\nThis solution would also fix the bug, but it may have a slightly larger memory footprint.",
      "Add a Check for Out-of-Range Characters\nA third possible fix is to add a check for out-of-range characters before trying to access the codes array. We could add a simple if statement to check if the character value is within the range of the codes array, and if not, throw an exception or handle the error in some other way. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (i >= codes.length) {\n    throw new JsonParseException(\"Character value out of range\");\n}\nif (codes[i] != 0) {\n    break;\n}\n```\nThis solution would also fix the bug, but it may have a slightly larger performance impact due to the additional check."
