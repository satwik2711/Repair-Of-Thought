However, this check is not sufficient to handle the case where the root is at one of the endpoints, because the function values at the endpoints may have the same sign even if the root is at one of the endpoints.\n\nSuggestion 1: Check for Endpoint Roots\nWe can add a check at the beginning of the `solve` method to see if the function value at either endpoint is close to zero. If it is, we can return that endpoint as the root. This would handle the case where the root is at one of the endpoints. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic double solve(double min, double max) throws MaxIterationsExceededException, \n    FunctionEvaluationException {\n    \n    clearResult();\n    verifyInterval(min, max);\n    \n    double ret = Double.NaN;\n    \n    double yMin = f.value(min);\n    double yMax = f.value(max);\n    \n    // Check if either endpoint is a root\n    if (Math.abs(yMin) < getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n        return min;\n    } else if (Math.abs(yMax) < getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n        return max;\n    }\n    \n    // Verify bracketing\n    double sign = yMin * yMax;\n    if (sign >= 0) {\n        // check if either value is close to a zero\n            // neither value is close to zero and min and max do not bracket root.\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException\n            (\"Function values at endpoints do not have different signs.\" +\n                    \"  Endpoints: [\" + min + \",\" + max + \"]\" + \n                    \"  Values: [\" + yMin + \",\" + yMax + \"]\");\n    } else {\n        // solve using only the first endpoint as initial guess\n        ret = solve(min, yMin, max, yMax, min, yMin);\n        // either min or max is a root\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 2: Modify the Bracketing Check\nWe can modify the bracketing check to allow for the case where the root is at one of the endpoints. Instead of checking if the signs of the function values at the endpoints are different, we can check if the function value at either endpoint is close to zero. If it is, we can consider the endpoint to be a root. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic double solve(double min, double max) throws MaxIterationsExceededException, \n    FunctionEvaluationException {\n    \n    clearResult();\n    verifyInterval(min, max);\n    \n    double ret = Double.NaN;\n    \n    double yMin = f.value(min);\n    double yMax = f.value(max);\n    \n    // Verify bracketing\n    if (Math.abs(yMin) < getAbsoluteAccuracy() || Math.abs(yMax) < getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n        // either min or max is a root\n        if (Math.abs(yMin) < getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n            return min;\n        } else {\n            return max;\n        }\n    } else if (yMin * yMax < 0) {\n        // solve using only the first endpoint as initial guess\n        ret = solve(min, yMin, max, yMax, min, yMin);\n    } else {\n        // check if either value is close to a zero\n            // neither value is close to zero and min and max do not bracket root.\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException\n            (\"Function values at endpoints do not have different signs.\" +\n                    \"  Endpoints: [\" + min + \",\" + max + \"]\" + \n                    \"  Values: [\" + yMin + \",\" + yMax + \"]\");\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a Tolerance-Based Bracketing Check\nWe can modify the bracketing check to use a tolerance-based approach. Instead of checking if the signs of the function values at the endpoints are different, we can check if the absolute difference between the function values at the endpoints is less than a certain tolerance. If it is, we can consider the endpoints to bracket the root. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\npublic double solve(double min, double max) throws MaxIterationsExceededException, \n    FunctionEvaluationException {\n    \n    clearResult();\n    verifyInterval(min, max);\n    \n    double ret = Double.NaN;\n    \n    double yMin = f.value(min);\n    double yMax = f.value(max);\n    \n    // Verify bracketing\n    if (Math.abs(yMin - yMax) < getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n        // either min or max is a root\n        if (Math.abs(yMin) < getAbsoluteAccuracy()) {\n            return min;\n        } else {\n            return max;\n        }\n    } else if (yMin * yMax < 0) {\n        // solve using only the first endpoint as initial guess\n        ret = solve(min, yMin, max, yMax, min, yMin);\n    } else {\n        // check if either value is close to a zero\n            // neither value is close to zero and min and max do not bracket root.\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException\n            (\"Function values at endpoints do not have different signs.\" +\n                    \"  Endpoints: [\" + min + \",\" + max + \"]\" + \n                    \"  Values: [\" + yMin + \",\" + yMax + \"]\");\n    }\n\n    return ret;\n}\n```",
