    "The root cause of the bug is that the `burstToken` function is not correctly handling unrecognized options when `stopAtNonOption` is set to `false`. When an unrecognized option is encountered, the function adds the character prepended with `-` to the list of tokens, but it does not stop processing the token. This can lead to incorrect parsing of the command line.": [
      "Stop Processing Token on Unrecognized Option\nOne possible fix is to stop processing the token when an unrecognized option is encountered, regardless of the value of `stopAtNonOption`. This can be achieved by adding a `break` statement after adding the special token `--` followed by the remaining characters to the list of tokens. This fix ensures that the function correctly handles unrecognized options and prevents incorrect parsing of the command line.",
      "Add Unrecognized Option to Tokens List with Special Marker\nAnother possible fix is to add the unrecognized option to the list of tokens, but with a special marker to indicate that it is an unrecognized option. This can be achieved by adding a new token to the list with a special prefix, such as `--unrecognized-`. This fix allows the function to continue processing the token, but with a clear indication that the option is unrecognized.",
      "Throw Exception on Unrecognized Option\nA third possible fix is to throw an exception when an unrecognized option is encountered, regardless of the value of `stopAtNonOption`. This can be achieved by throwing an `UnrecognizedOptionException` with a message indicating the unrecognized option. This fix ensures that the function correctly handles unrecognized options and provides a clear error message to the user.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
