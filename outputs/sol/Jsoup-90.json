This could involve checking for the presence of certain byte sequences that are characteristic of UTF-8 encoding. For example, we could check for the presence of the UTF-8 BOM, as well as other byte sequences that are commonly used in UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nSuggestion 3: Handle Short Input Arrays Gracefully\nInstead of throwing an exception when the input array is too short, we could handle this case gracefully by returning a default value or throwing a more informative exception. This would make the function more robust and easier to use. For example, we could return false when the input array is too short, indicating that the input is not likely to be UTF-8 encoded.",
