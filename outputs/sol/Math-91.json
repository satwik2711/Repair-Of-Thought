The function is not correctly handling cases where the fractions are approximately equal.\n\nSuggestion 1: Using a Tolerance for Comparison\nOne possible fix is to use a tolerance when comparing the double values of the fractions. This can be done by checking if the absolute difference between the two values is less than a certain threshold. If it is, we can consider the fractions to be equal. The modified `compareTo` function would be:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = doubleValue();\n    double dOn = object.doubleValue();\n    double tolerance = 1.0e-20;\n    if (Math.abs(nOd - dOn) < tolerance) {\n        return 0;\n    } else {\n        return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 2: Using a More Precise Comparison Method\nAnother possible fix is to use a more precise comparison method, such as comparing the fractions using their numerator and denominator values instead of their double values. This can be done by using a method such as `compareCrossProduct`. The modified `compareTo` function would be:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    long crossProduct = getNumerator() * object.getDenominator() - getDenominator() * object.getNumerator();\n    if (crossProduct < 0) {\n        return -1;\n    } else if (crossProduct > 0) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Rounding the Double Values\nA third possible fix is to round the double values of the fractions to a certain number of decimal places before comparing them. This can help to reduce the effect of floating-point precision issues. The modified `compareTo` function would be:\n```java\npublic int compareTo(Fraction object) {\n    double nOd = round(doubleValue(), 20);\n    double dOn = round(object.doubleValue(), 20);\n    return (nOd < dOn) ? -1 : ((nOd > dOn) ? +1 : 0);\n}\n\nprivate double round(double value, int decimalPlaces) {\n    double multiplier = Math.pow(10, decimalPlaces);\n    return Math.round(value * multiplier) / multiplier;\n}\n```",
