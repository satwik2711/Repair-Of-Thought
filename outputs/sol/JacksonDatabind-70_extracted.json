    "The root cause of the bug is that the `remove` function is case-sensitive when checking for the property to be removed, whereas the `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` test case is designed to test case-insensitive properties. This mismatch in case sensitivity causes the property 'businessAddress' to not be found, resulting in the `NoSuchElementException`.": [
      "Use Case-Insensitive Comparison\nOne possible fix is to use a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the property to be removed exists. We can use the `equalsIgnoreCase` method instead of the `equals` method to compare the property names. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, matching the behavior of the `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` test case. The updated code would be: `found = key.equalsIgnoreCase(prop.getName());`",
      "Normalize Property Names\nAnother possible fix is to normalize the property names to a standard case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, regardless of the case of the property names. We can use the `toLowerCase` method to normalize the property names. The updated code would be: `found = key.equals(prop.getName().toLowerCase());` and `key = getPropertyName(propToRm).toLowerCase();`",
      "Use a Case-Insensitive Key for Property Retrieval\nA third possible fix is to use a case-insensitive key for property retrieval. We can use the `toLowerCase` method to normalize the property name when retrieving it from the `_hashArea` array. This will ensure that the property is retrieved in a case-insensitive manner, matching the behavior of the `testCaseInsensitiveUnwrap` test case. The updated code would be: `String key = getPropertyName(propToRm).toLowerCase();` and `found = key.equals(prop.getName().toLowerCase());`"
