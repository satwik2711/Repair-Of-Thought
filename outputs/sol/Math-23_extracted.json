    "The root cause of the bug is that the BrentOptimizer is not correctly updating the best point when the initial point is the best point. This is because the optimizer is using a convergence criterion that is based on the relative difference between the current point and the previous point, rather than the absolute difference. This means that if the initial point is very close to the minimum point, the optimizer may not correctly identify it as the best point.": [
      "Modify Convergence Criterion\nOne possible fix is to modify the convergence criterion to use the absolute difference between the current point and the previous point, rather than the relative difference. This can be done by changing the line `final boolean stop = FastMath.abs(x - m) <= tol2 - 0.5 * (b - a);` to `final boolean stop = FastMath.abs(x - m) <= tol1;`. This will ensure that the optimizer correctly identifies the best point even when the initial point is very close to the minimum point.",
      "Add Special Case for Initial Point\nAnother possible fix is to add a special case to handle the situation where the initial point is the best point. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the optimization loop to see if the initial point is the best point, and if so, returning it immediately. This can be done by adding the following code at the beginning of the optimization loop: `if (x == init && fx <= fv) { return best(current, previous, isMinim); }`.",
      "Modify Update of Best Point\nA third possible fix is to modify the update of the best point to use a more robust method, such as using the minimum of the current point and the previous point. This can be done by changing the line `x = u;` to `x = Math.min(u, x);`. This will ensure that the optimizer correctly updates the best point even when the initial point is very close to the minimum point."
