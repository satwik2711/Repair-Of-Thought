The function `get` is supposed to return a value by name from a record. It takes a `name` parameter, checks if a header mapping is provided, and then attempts to retrieve the corresponding value from the `values` array using the index obtained from the `mapping`. The trigger test `testGetStringInconsistentRecord` adds a header with a value of 4 and then calls the `get` function with the name 'fourth'.
