    "The root cause of the bug is that the escape function is not correctly handling the non-breaking space character (U+00A0) in the Shift_JIS encoding. When the escape function encounters this character, it is not correctly escaping it, resulting in a '?' character being output instead. This is likely due to the fact that the escape function is using the canEncode method of the CharsetEncoder to determine if a character can be encoded, but this method is not sufficient to handle all cases.": [
      "Use a More Robust Encoding Check\nOne potential fix is to use a more robust encoding check in the escape function. Instead of relying solely on the canEncode method of the CharsetEncoder, the function could also check if the character is a valid Unicode code point and if it can be represented in the target encoding. This would ensure that all characters are correctly escaped, even if they are not representable in the target encoding. The implementation would involve modifying the escape function to use a more robust encoding check, such as checking if the character is a valid Unicode code point and if it can be represented in the target encoding.",
      "Handle Non-Breaking Space Character Specifically\nAnother potential fix is to handle the non-breaking space character (U+00A0) specifically in the escape function. This character is a special case in the Shift_JIS encoding, and the function could be modified to always escape it correctly, regardless of the encoding. This would involve adding a special case to the escape function to handle the non-breaking space character, and ensuring that it is always escaped correctly.",
      "Use a Fallback Encoder\nA third potential fix is to use a fallback encoder in the escape function. This would allow the function to correctly handle characters that cannot be encoded in the target encoding, by falling back to a different encoding that can represent the character. This would involve modifying the escape function to use a fallback encoder, such as the UTF-8 encoder, when the target encoding cannot represent a character. This would ensure that all characters are correctly escaped, even if they are not representable in the target encoding."
