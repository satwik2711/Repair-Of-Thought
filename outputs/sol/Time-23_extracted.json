    "The root cause of the bug is that the function getConvertedId is not correctly handling the old style id 'WET'. The function is using a map to store the conversions, but the map is not correctly populated. The map is populated with a set of old style ids and their corresponding new style ids, but the old style id 'WET' is not correctly mapped to its corresponding new style id. Instead, the old style id 'WET' is mapped to 'Europe/London', which is incorrect.": [
      "Correctly Map Old Style Id 'WET'\nOne potential fix is to correctly map the old style id 'WET' to its corresponding new style id. This can be done by adding the correct mapping to the map. For example, the map can be populated with the following code: map.put(\"WET\", \"WET\"); This will ensure that the function correctly handles the old style id 'WET' and returns the correct new style id.",
      "Use a More Comprehensive Mapping\nAnother potential fix is to use a more comprehensive mapping of old style ids to new style ids. This can be done by using a more comprehensive map that includes all possible old style ids and their corresponding new style ids. For example, the map can be populated with the following code: map.put(\"WET\", \"WET\"); map.put(\"CET\", \"CET\"); map.put(\"MET\", \"CET\"); ... This will ensure that the function correctly handles all possible old style ids and returns the correct new style ids.",
      "Handle Unknown Old Style Ids\nA third potential fix is to handle unknown old style ids. This can be done by adding a default mapping to the map that handles unknown old style ids. For example, the map can be populated with the following code: map.put(\"UNKNOWN\", \"UNKNOWN\"); Then, when the function encounters an unknown old style id, it can return the default new style id. This will ensure that the function correctly handles unknown old style ids and returns a default new style id."
