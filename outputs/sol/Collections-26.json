This would require significant changes to the serialization and deserialization code, but would avoid the need to override `readResolve()` or modify the `MultiKey` class. For example, we could use the Jackson library to serialize and deserialize the `DerivedMultiKey` objects:\n```java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nString json = mapper.writeValueAsString(mk);\nDerivedMultiKey<?> mk2 = mapper.readValue(json, DerivedMultiKey.class);\n```\nThis solution requires significant changes to the serialization and deserialization code, but would avoid the need to override `readResolve()` or modify the `MultiKey` class.",
