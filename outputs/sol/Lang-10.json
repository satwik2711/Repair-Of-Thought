The function `escapeRegex` is designed to escape constant fields into regular expressions. It takes a `StringBuilder` regex, a source field `value`, and a boolean `unquote` as parameters. The function iterates over each character in the `value` string and appends it to the `regex` StringBuilder, escaping special characters if necessary. The trigger test `testLANG_831` calls the `testSdfAndFdp` method with the arguments `M E`, `3  Tue`, and `true`. The error message indicates that the expected failure did not occur, and instead, a date was parsed successfully using the regular expression.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of whitespace characters in the `escapeRegex` function. When a whitespace character is encountered, the function appends `\\\\s*+` to the regex, which matches zero or more whitespace characters. However, this can lead to incorrect parsing of dates when the input string contains multiple whitespace characters. The `+` quantifier is possessive, which means that it will match as many characters as possible, including the subsequent whitespace characters.
