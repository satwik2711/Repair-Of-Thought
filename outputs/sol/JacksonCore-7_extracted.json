    "The 'writeValue()' function is not correctly handling the case where a string is being written as a field name. Specifically, it is not checking if the current context is a field name context, and it is not correctly formatting the JSON output. This is causing the 'writeString()' function to be used in place of 'writeFieldName()', leading to the error message.": [
      "Add Field Name Context Check\nOne potential fix is to add a check in the 'writeValue()' function to see if the current context is a field name context. If it is, then the function should return 'STATUS_OK_AS_IS' to indicate that the field name should be written without any additional formatting. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nif (_type == TYPE_OBJECT && _gotName) {\n    return STATUS_OK_AS_IS;\n}\n```\nThis check would ensure that the 'writeValue()' function correctly handles the case where a string is being written as a field name.",
      "Correctly Format JSON Output\nAnother potential fix is to correctly format the JSON output in the 'writeValue()' function. This could involve adding a check to see if the current context is a field name context, and if so, adding a colon and a space to the output. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nif (_type == TYPE_OBJECT && _gotName) {\n    _output.write(':');\n    _output.write(' ');\n}\n```\nThis would ensure that the JSON output is correctly formatted, with a colon and a space separating the field name from its value.",
      "Use 'writeFieldName()' Instead of 'writeString()'\nA third potential fix is to use the 'writeFieldName()' function instead of the 'writeString()' function when writing a field name. This would ensure that the field name is correctly formatted and that the 'writeString()' function is not used in place of 'writeFieldName()'. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nif (_type == TYPE_OBJECT && _gotName) {\n    _generator.writeFieldName(_currentName);\n}\n```\nThis would ensure that the field name is correctly written, with the correct formatting and without using the 'writeString()' function."
