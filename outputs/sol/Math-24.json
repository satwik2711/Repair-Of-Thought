This can be done by replacing the parabolic interpolation step with a golden section step in the BrentOptimizer. This will make the optimizer more robust to discontinuities in the function. The golden section step is a more conservative approach that is less likely to be affected by discontinuities.\n\nSuggestion 2: Add Check for Discontinuities\nAnother possible fix is to add a check for discontinuities in the function and handle them separately. This can be done by adding a check for discontinuities in the BrentOptimizer and using a different interpolation step when a discontinuity is detected. This will make the optimizer more robust to discontinuities in the function. The check for discontinuities can be done by comparing the function values at two consecutive points and checking if the difference is greater than a certain threshold.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a More Robust Interpolation Step with a Smaller Tolerance\nAnother possible fix is to use a more robust interpolation step, such as a cubic interpolation step, with a smaller tolerance. This can be done by replacing the parabolic interpolation step with a cubic interpolation step in the BrentOptimizer and reducing the tolerance for the interpolation step. This will make the optimizer more robust to discontinuities in the function and reduce the likelihood of converging to a wrong minimum. The smaller tolerance will also reduce the likelihood of overshooting the minimum.",
