This can be done by adding a check in the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` to see if the property is being reassigned, and if so, update the type information accordingly.

This could involve using a more advanced type inference algorithm, such as one that uses flow-sensitive typing or abstract interpretation. By using a more robust type inference algorithm, we can ensure that the type information for the property `fn` is always up-to-date and accurate, even in cases where the property is reassigned to a new function.\n\nSuggestion 3: Add a Special Case for Reassigned Functions\nA third possible solution is to add a special case in the function `maybeDeclareQualifiedName` to handle the case where a property is reassigned to a new function.
