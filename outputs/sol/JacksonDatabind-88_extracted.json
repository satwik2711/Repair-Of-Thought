    "The root cause of the bug is that the `_typeFromId` function is not correctly handling the case where the id contains generics information. Specifically, when the id is a nested type like `java.util.HashMap<java.lang.String,java.lang.String>`, the function is not correctly constructing the type. This is because the `constructFromCanonical` method is not able to handle nested types correctly.": [
      "Modify constructFromCanonical Method\nOne possible fix is to modify the `constructFromCanonical` method to correctly handle nested types. This could involve adding a new method to the `TypeFactory` class that can handle nested types, or modifying the existing method to recursively construct the type. However, this approach may require significant changes to the existing code and may not be the most efficient solution.",
      "Use a Different Type Construction Method\nAnother possible fix is to use a different method to construct the type, such as `constructSpecializedType`. This method is able to handle nested types correctly, so we could modify the `_typeFromId` function to use this method instead of `constructFromCanonical`. This approach is more straightforward and may be more efficient than modifying the `constructFromCanonical` method.",
      "Add a New Method to Handle Nested Types\nA third possible fix is to add a new method to the `TypeFactory` class that is specifically designed to handle nested types. This method could be used by the `_typeFromId` function to construct the type correctly. This approach would allow us to keep the existing code intact and add a new method to handle the specific case of nested types. However, this approach may require additional testing to ensure that the new method works correctly in all cases.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
