    "The issue is caused by the fact that the `TokenBuffer` is not correctly handling the unwrapped fields after the last creator property. Specifically, the `tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p)` call is not correctly copying the remaining tokens into the buffer, resulting in the loss of data for the unwrapped fields.": [
      "Fix TokenBuffer Copying\nOne possible fix is to modify the `tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p)` call to correctly copy the remaining tokens into the buffer. This can be done by using the `tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p, true)` method, which will correctly handle the unwrapped fields after the last creator property. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nwhile (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\n    // NOTE: do NOT skip name as it needs to be copied; `copyCurrentStructure` does that\n    p.nextToken();\n    tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p, true); // Modified line\n    t = p.nextToken();\n}\n```\nThis fix should correctly handle the unwrapped fields after the last creator property and resolve the bug.",
      "Use a Different Deserialization Approach\nAnother possible fix is to use a different deserialization approach that does not rely on the `TokenBuffer` class. For example, the `ObjectMapper` class provides a `readTree` method that can be used to deserialize JSON data into a `JsonNode` object, which can then be used to construct the desired Java object. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nJsonNode jsonNode = mapper.readTree(p);\n// Use the jsonNode to construct the desired Java object\n```\nThis fix would require significant changes to the existing code, but it would provide a more robust and flexible deserialization approach.",
      "Modify the Creator Property Handling\nA third possible fix is to modify the creator property handling to correctly handle the unwrapped fields after the last creator property. This can be done by adding additional logic to the `creator.findCreatorProperty(propName)` method to correctly handle the unwrapped fields. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nSettableBeanProperty creatorProp = creator.findCreatorProperty(propName);\nif (creatorProp != null) {\n    // Add additional logic to handle unwrapped fields\n    if (buffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, _deserializeWithErrorWrapping(p, ctxt, creatorProp))) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis fix would require careful consideration of the creator property handling logic, but it would provide a more targeted solution to the bug."
