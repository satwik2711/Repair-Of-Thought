    "The root cause of the bug is that the `buildWriter` function is not correctly handling the case where the property is null and the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`. In this case, the function should suppress the null property, but it is not doing so correctly. This is due to the fact that the function is not correctly determining the default value for the property, which is causing the null property to be included in the serialization result.": [
      "Modify buildWriter Function to Suppress Null Properties\nThe `buildWriter` function should be modified to check if the property is null and the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`, and if so, suppress the null property. This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:\n```java\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    suppressNulls = true;\n}\n```\nThis modification would ensure that the null property is correctly suppressed when the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`.",
      "Modify getPropertyDefaultValue Function to Return Null for Null Properties\nThe `getPropertyDefaultValue` function should be modified to return null when the property is null and the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`. This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:\n```java\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && value == null) {\n    return null;\n}\n```\nThis modification would ensure that the default value for the property is correctly determined when the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`.",
      "Add Additional Check for Null Properties in buildWriter Function\nThe `buildWriter` function should be modified to add an additional check for null properties when the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`. If the property is null, the function should return a `BeanPropertyWriter` instance that suppresses the null property. This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:\n```java\nif (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT && valueToSuppress == null) {\n    return new BeanPropertyWriter(propDef, am, _beanDesc.getClassAnnotations(), declaredType, ser, typeSer, serializationType, true, null);\n}\n```\nThis modification would ensure that the null property is correctly suppressed when the serialization inclusion is set to `NON_DEFAULT`."
