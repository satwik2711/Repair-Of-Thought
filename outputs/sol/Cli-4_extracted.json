    "The root cause of the bug is that the error message in the `MissingOptionException` is not being constructed correctly. The `StringBuffer` is being used to append the required options, but it is not being prefixed with the expected message 'Missing required option: '.": [
      "Prefix the Error Message\nWe can prefix the error message with 'Missing required option: ' before throwing the `MissingOptionException`. This can be done by modifying the `checkRequiredOptions` function as follows:\n```java\nthrow new MissingOptionException(\"Missing required option: \" + buff.toString());\n```\nThis solution is simple and straightforward, and it correctly constructs the error message.",
      "Use a StringBuilder\nWe can use a `StringBuilder` instead of a `StringBuffer` to construct the error message. This can be done by modifying the `checkRequiredOptions` function as follows:\n```java\nStringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(\"Missing required option: \");\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\n    builder.append(iter.next());\n}\nthrow new MissingOptionException(builder.toString());\n```\nThis solution is more efficient than using a `StringBuffer`, as `StringBuilder` is not synchronized.",
      "Use String Concatenation\nWe can use string concatenation to construct the error message. This can be done by modifying the `checkRequiredOptions` function as follows:\n```java\nString errorMessage = \"Missing required option: \";\nwhile (iter.hasNext()) {\n    errorMessage += iter.next();\n}\nthrow new MissingOptionException(errorMessage);\n```\nThis solution is simple and easy to understand, but it may be less efficient than using a `StringBuilder` for large numbers of required options."
