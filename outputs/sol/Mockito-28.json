The function `injectMockCandidate` is designed to inject mock candidates into fields of a class hierarchy.

This could involve changing the ordering logic to prioritize fields with exact type matches over fields with ancestor type matches. This would ensure that the mock injection happens in the correct field.\n\nSuggestion 2: Improve the Mock Candidate Filtering\nAnother possible fix is to improve the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method to correctly filter the mock candidates based on the field type and the mock instance. This could involve adding additional logic to handle cases where there are multiple fields with the same type, or where the mock instance is not a direct match for the field type.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a More Specific Field Matcher\nA third possible fix is to use a more specific field matcher in the `injectMockCandidate` method. Instead of using the `orderedInstanceFieldsFrom` method, which returns all fields of the class hierarchy, we could use a more specific matcher that only returns fields with exact type matches.
