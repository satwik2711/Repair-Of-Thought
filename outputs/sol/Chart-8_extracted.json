    "The root cause of the issue is that the `Week` constructor is not correctly handling the time zone and locale. When the constructor is called with a specific time zone, it is not using that time zone to calculate the week number. Instead, it is using the default time zone, which is causing the discrepancy in the week number. This is because the constructor is calling itself with default values for time zone and locale, which is overriding the specified time zone.": [
      "Use Specified Time Zone\nInstead of calling itself with default values for time zone and locale, the constructor should use the specified time zone to calculate the week number. This can be done by removing the recursive call and using the specified time zone directly. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    // Use specified time zone to calculate week number\n    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(zone);\n    cal.setTime(time);\n    int week = cal.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);\n    // ... rest of the code ...\n}\n```\nThis approach is straightforward and directly addresses the issue.",
      "Use Locale-Specific Week Number\nAnother approach is to use the locale-specific week number. This can be done by using the `Calendar` class to get the first day of the week for the specified locale, and then calculating the week number based on that. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    // Get locale-specific first day of week\n    Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();\n    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(zone, locale);\n    cal.setTime(time);\n    int week = cal.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);\n    // ... rest of the code ...\n}\n```\nThis approach takes into account the locale-specific week number, which may be different from the default week number.",
      "Use Time Zone-Specific Week Number with Calendar\nA third approach is to use the time zone-specific week number with the `Calendar` class. This can be done by using the `TimeZone` class to get the offset of the specified time zone, and then calculating the week number based on that. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    // Get time zone-specific offset\n    int offset = zone.getRawOffset();\n    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();\n    cal.setTimeZone(zone);\n    cal.setTime(time);\n    int week = cal.get(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR);\n    // ... rest of the code ...\n}\n```\nThis approach takes into account the time zone-specific offset, which may affect the week number calculation."
