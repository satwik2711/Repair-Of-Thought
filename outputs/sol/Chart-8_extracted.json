    "The root cause of the issue is that the Week constructor defers argument checking and uses the RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE and Locale.getDefault() as defaults, which may not always match the time zone and locale used to create the Date object passed to the constructor. This leads to incorrect week number calculations when the time zone and locale have different first days of the week.": [
      "Use the Provided Time Zone and Locale\nThe Week constructor should use the provided time zone and locale instead of deferring to the default time zone and locale. This can be achieved by modifying the constructor to directly use the provided time zone and locale, ensuring that the week calculation is performed in the correct context. The modified constructor would look like this:\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());\n}",
      "Adjust the Week Calculation Based on the First Day of the Week\nIf the first day of the week in the provided time zone differs from the default, the Week constructor should adjust the week calculation accordingly. This may involve adding or subtracting a day from the calculated week number. The constructor can use the Calendar class to determine the first day of the week in the provided time zone and adjust the calculation as needed.",
      "Create a New Calendar Instance with the Provided Time Zone and Locale\nThe Week constructor could create a new Calendar instance with the provided time zone and locale, and then use this calendar to calculate the week number. This approach ensures that the week calculation is performed in the correct context, taking into account the specific time zone and locale. The modified constructor would create a new Calendar instance and use it to calculate the week number, like this:\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance(zone, Locale.getDefault());\n    cal.setTime(time);\n    // calculate week number using cal\n}"
