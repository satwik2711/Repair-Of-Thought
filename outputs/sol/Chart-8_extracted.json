    "The root cause of the bug is that the `Week` constructor is not taking into account the locale when calculating the week number. The constructor is calling `this(time, RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE, Locale.getDefault())`, which means it's using the default locale to calculate the week number. However, the default locale is being changed in the test to 'da' and 'Europe/Copenhagen', which has a different first day of the week (Monday) than the default locale (Sunday). This is causing the week number to be calculated incorrectly.": [
      "Use the Provided Locale\nOne possible fix is to use the provided locale when calculating the week number. We can do this by changing the constructor to `this(time, zone, locale)`. This will ensure that the correct locale is used when calculating the week number. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone, Locale locale) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nHowever, since the problem statement does not allow adding new parameters to the constructor, we can modify the existing constructor to use the provided locale. We can do this by calling the deprecated constructor with the provided locale:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());\n}\n```\nAnd then modifying the deprecated constructor to use the provided locale:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone, Locale locale) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nBut since we cannot modify the deprecated constructor, we can create a new constructor with the same parameters and use that instead:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());\n}\n\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone, Locale locale) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nHowever, this is not allowed according to the problem statement. Therefore, we can use the following approach:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis way, we are using the default locale, but we are not using the default time zone.",
      "Use the Time Zone's Locale\nAnother possible fix is to use the time zone's locale when calculating the week number. We can do this by changing the constructor to use the time zone's locale:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    Locale locale = zone.getLocale();\n    // ...\n}\n```\nHowever, the `TimeZone` class does not have a `getLocale()` method. Therefore, we cannot use this approach.",
      "Use the Provided Time Zone and Locale\nA third possible fix is to use the provided time zone and locale when calculating the week number. We can do this by changing the constructor to use the provided time zone and locale:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();\n    if (zone.getID().equals(\"Europe/Copenhagen\")) {\n        locale = new Locale(\"da\", \"DK\");\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nHowever, this approach is not good because it is hardcoded for a specific time zone. A better approach would be to use the time zone's ID to determine the locale:\n```java\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    Locale locale = Locale.getDefault();\n    if (zone.getID().startsWith(\"Europe/\")) {\n        locale = new Locale(\"en\", \"EU\");\n    } else if (zone.getID().startsWith(\"US/\")) {\n        locale = new Locale(\"en\", \"US\");\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nHowever, this approach is still not good because it is hardcoded for specific time zones. A better approach would be to use a `Map` to map time zones to locales:\n```java\nprivate static final Map<String, Locale> TIME_ZONE_LOCALES = new HashMap<>();\n\nstatic {\n    TIME_ZONE_LOCALES.put(\"Europe/Copenhagen\", new Locale(\"da\", \"DK\"));\n    TIME_ZONE_LOCALES.put(\"US/Detroit\", new Locale(\"en\", \"US\"));\n    // ...\n}\n\npublic Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {\n    Locale locale = TIME_ZONE_LOCALES.get(zone.getID());\n    if (locale == null) {\n        locale = Locale.getDefault();\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nHowever, this approach is still not good because it requires a lot of hardcoded data. A better approach would be to use a database or a file to store the mapping between time zones and locales."
