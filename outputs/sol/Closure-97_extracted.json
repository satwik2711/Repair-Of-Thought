    "The issue lies in the way the function handles unsigned right shift operations. When the left operand is negative and the shift amount is 0, the function should return the unsigned equivalent of the left operand. However, the current implementation returns the original negative value.": [
      "Use Unsigned Right Shift Operator\nOne possible solution is to use the unsigned right shift operator (`>>>`) when the left operand is negative and the shift amount is 0. This will ensure that the function returns the correct unsigned equivalent of the left operand. The modified code would be:\n```java\ncase Token.URSH:\n    if (lvalInt < 0 && rvalInt == 0) {\n        result = lvalInt >>> rvalInt;\n    } else {\n        result = lvalInt >>> rvalInt;\n    }\n    break;\n```",
      "Add Special Case for Negative Left Operand\nAnother possible solution is to add a special case for when the left operand is negative and the shift amount is 0. In this case, the function can return the unsigned equivalent of the left operand by using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) with the maximum unsigned integer value (`0xFFFFFFFF`). The modified code would be:\n```java\ncase Token.URSH:\n    if (lvalInt < 0 && rvalInt == 0) {\n        result = lvalInt & 0xFFFFFFFFL;\n    } else {\n        result = lvalInt >>> rvalInt;\n    }\n    break;\n```",
      "Use Long Data Type for Intermediate Results\nA third possible solution is to use the `long` data type for intermediate results when performing unsigned right shift operations. This will ensure that the function can handle large values correctly and avoid overflow issues. The modified code would be:\n```java\ncase Token.URSH:\n    long lvalLong = lvalInt;\n    result = lvalLong >>> rvalInt;\n    break;\n```\n\",\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
