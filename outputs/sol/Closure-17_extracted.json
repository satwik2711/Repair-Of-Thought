    "The root cause of this bug is that the function getDeclaredType is not correctly handling the case where the rValue is an object literal with a type annotation. In this case, the function is returning the type of the object literal (TwoNumbers) instead of the type of the property (number). This is because the function is not checking if the property has a type annotation and is not using the type annotation to determine the type of the property.": [
      "Check for Type Annotation on Object Literal\nOne potential fix is to add a check in the getDeclaredType function to see if the rValue is an object literal with a type annotation. If it is, we can use the type annotation to determine the type of the property. We can do this by adding a new condition to the if statement that checks if the rValue is an object literal and if it has a type annotation. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the rValue is an object literal with a type annotation.",
      "Use Type Annotation to Determine Property Type\nAnother potential fix is to use the type annotation on the object literal to determine the type of the property. We can do this by adding a new line of code that checks if the rValue has a type annotation and if so, uses the type annotation to determine the type of the property. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the rValue is an object literal with a type annotation.",
      "Add Special Handling for Object Literals with Type Annotations\nA third potential fix is to add special handling for object literals with type annotations. We can do this by adding a new if statement that checks if the rValue is an object literal with a type annotation and if so, handles it specially. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the rValue is an object literal with a type annotation.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
