    "The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of negative zero in the `addNumber(double x)` function. When `x` is negative zero, the function checks if the previous character is '-', and if so, adds a space before adding the number. However, this check is not sufficient to handle the case where the previous character is already a space, resulting in an extra space being added.": [
      "Check for Existing Space\nCheck if the previous character is already a space before adding another space. This can be done by modifying the condition `if (x < 0 && prev == '-')` to `if (x < 0 && prev == '-' && !isLastCharSpace())`. This will prevent the extra space from being added.",
      "Use a Different Approach\nInstead of checking for the previous character, we can use a different approach to handle negative zero. We can check if the number is negative zero and if so, add a '.0' to the end of the number. This can be done by modifying the condition `if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero)` to `if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero && !isNegativeZero(x))`. This will ensure that negative zero is handled correctly.",
      "Remove Unnecessary Space Addition\nRemove the unnecessary space addition when the previous character is already a space. This can be done by modifying the condition `if (x < 0 && prev == '-')` to `if (x < 0 && prev == '-' && prev != ' ')`. This will prevent the extra space from being added when the previous character is already a space."
