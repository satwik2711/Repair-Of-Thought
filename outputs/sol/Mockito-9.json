Well, it just doesn't...\n* Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object.\n* In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.\n* <p>\n* However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy:\n* dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.)\n* However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.\n* <p>\n*/\npublic Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {\n        return invocation.callRealMethod();\n    }\n\n2.
