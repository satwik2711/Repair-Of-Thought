This can be done by adding a simple null check in the validate method. If the quote character is null, the method can either throw an exception or set a default quote character.

This can be done by adding a null check in the printHeader method and printing the header without quotes if the quote character is null.

However, it may not be suitable for all applications, as it may require additional error handling.",
