    "The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the DST overlap period. When the local time is ambiguous, the function should return the earlier instant, but it is not doing so correctly. Specifically, the issue arises when the offsetLocal and offsetAdjusted are different, and the function is trying to ensure that the time is always after the DST gap. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the case when the offsetLocal is negative.": [
      "Correctly Handle Negative Offset\nThe issue arises when the offsetLocal is negative. We can fix this by adding a check for negative offsetLocal and adjusting the instantAdjusted accordingly. We can add the following code before calculating the instantAdjusted:\n```java\nif (offsetLocal < 0) {\n    instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal - 1;\n} else {\n    instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the instantAdjusted is always after the DST gap, even when the offsetLocal is negative.",
      "Use a Different Approach\nInstead of trying to adjust the instantAdjusted based on the offsetLocal, we can use a different approach. We can calculate the next transition time and use that to determine the correct offset. We can add the following code:\n```java\nlong nextTransitionTime = nextTransition(instantLocal);\nif (nextTransitionTime != instantLocal) {\n    return getOffset(nextTransitionTime);\n} else {\n    return offsetAdjusted;\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that we always return the correct offset, even during the DST overlap period.",
      "Simplify the Logic\nThe current implementation has a lot of conditional statements and adjustments. We can simplify the logic by removing the unnecessary checks and adjustments. We can add the following code:\n```java\nlong nextTransitionTime = nextTransition(instantLocal);\nreturn getOffset(nextTransitionTime);\n```\nThis will ensure that we always return the correct offset, even during the DST overlap period."
