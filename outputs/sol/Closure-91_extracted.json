    "The root cause of the issue is that the function shouldTraverse is not correctly handling the case where a function is being lent to a prototype using the @lends annotation. The function is returning false for this case, indicating that the node should not be traversed, but this is incorrect. The function should return true for this case, allowing the node to be traversed and the @lends annotation to be processed correctly.": [
      "Modify the shouldTraverse Function to Correctly Handle @lends Annotation\nWe can modify the function shouldTraverse to correctly handle the case where a function is being lent to a prototype using the @lends annotation. We can add a new condition to check if the parent node is a call to dojo.declare and if the @lends annotation is present. If both conditions are true, we can return true, allowing the node to be traversed. This can be achieved by adding the following code to the function:\n```java\nif (parent != null && parent.getType() == Token.CALL) {\n    Node callee = parent.getFirstChild();\n    if (callee.getString().equals(\"dojo.declare\")) {\n        JSDocInfo jsDoc = getFunctionJsDocInfo(n);\n        if (jsDoc != null && jsDoc.hasLendsAnnotation()) {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Add a New Condition to Check for @lends Annotation\nWe can add a new condition to the function shouldTraverse to check if the @lends annotation is present on the parent node. If the annotation is present, we can return true, allowing the node to be traversed. This condition can be added in addition to the existing conditions, ensuring that the function correctly handles all cases. This can be achieved by adding the following code to the function:\n```java\nif (parent != null && parent.getType() == Token.OBJECTLIT) {\n    JSDocInfo jsDoc = getFunctionJsDocInfo(n);\n    if (jsDoc != null && jsDoc.hasLendsAnnotation()) {\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Modify the getFunctionJsDocInfo Function to Correctly Handle @lends Annotation\nWe can modify the function getFunctionJsDocInfo to correctly handle the case where a function is being lent to a prototype using the @lends annotation. We can add a new condition to check if the @lends annotation is present on the function node. If the annotation is present, we can return the JSDocInfo object for the lent function, allowing the shouldTraverse function to correctly handle the case. This can be achieved by adding the following code to the function:\n```java\nif (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION) {\n    JSDocInfo jsDoc = getJsDocInfo(n);\n    if (jsDoc != null && jsDoc.hasLendsAnnotation()) {\n        return jsDoc;\n    }\n}\n```"
