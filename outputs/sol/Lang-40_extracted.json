    "The root cause of the bug is that the `toUpperCase()` method is not locale-independent. It converts characters to uppercase based on the default locale, which can lead to incorrect results when dealing with locale-specific characters. In this case, the character '\\\\u00df' is being converted to 'SS' when the locale is set to English, but it should be converted to '\\u00df' when the locale is set to German. This is causing the `containsIgnoreCase` function to return incorrect results.": [
      "Use Locale-Independent Case Conversion\nUse the `String.equalsIgnoreCase()` method instead of `toUpperCase()` to compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner. This method is locale-independent and will correctly handle locale-specific characters.",
      "Use Unicode Case Folding\nUse the `String.normalize()` method to normalize the strings to their Unicode case-folded form, and then compare them using the `String.equals()` method. This approach is also locale-independent and will correctly handle locale-specific characters.",
      "Use ICU4J Library\nUse the ICU4J library, which provides a locale-independent way of converting strings to uppercase. The `com.ibm.icu.text.UCharacter` class provides a `toUpperCase()` method that takes a locale as an argument, allowing for locale-independent case conversion.\n\n\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\""
