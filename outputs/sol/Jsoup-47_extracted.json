    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `escape` is not correctly handling the '>' character in XML attribute values. Specifically, the function is not appending `&gt;` when the '>' character is encountered in an XML attribute value. This is because the function is only checking if the current character is '<' and not '>' when deciding whether to append `&lt;` or `&gt;`.": [
      "Add Additional Case for '>' Character\nOne potential fix is to add an additional case for the '>' character in the switch statement. We can add a new case for '>' and append `&gt;` when the '>' character is encountered in an XML attribute value. This solution is simple and effective, and it correctly handles all possible cases.\n\n```java\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\nswitch (c) {\n    // ... (rest of the cases remain the same)\n    case '>':\n        if (!inAttribute)\n            accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n        else\n            accum.append(c);\n        break;\n}\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n```",
      "Modify Existing Case for '<' Character\nAnother potential fix is to modify the existing case for the '<' character. We can modify the case to also check for the '>' character and append `&gt;` when the '>' character is encountered in an XML attribute value. This solution is also effective, but it may be slightly more complex than the first suggestion.\n\n```java\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\nswitch (c) {\n    // ... (rest of the cases remain the same)\n    case '<':\n    case '>':\n        if (!inAttribute) {\n            if (c == '<')\n                accum.append(\"&lt;\");\n            else\n                accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n        } else\n            accum.append(c);\n        break;\n}\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n```",
      "Use a Separate Variable to Track XML Attribute Values\nA third potential fix is to use a separate variable to track whether we are currently inside an XML attribute value. We can use this variable to determine whether to append `&lt;` or `&gt;` when the '<' or '>' character is encountered. This solution is more complex than the first two suggestions, but it may be more flexible and easier to maintain.\n\n```java\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\nboolean inXmlAttributeValue = false;\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\nswitch (c) {\n    // ... (rest of the cases remain the same)\n    case '<':\n    case '>':\n        if (inXmlAttributeValue) {\n            if (c == '<')\n                accum.append(\"&lt;\");\n            else\n                accum.append(\"&gt;\");\n        } else\n            accum.append(c);\n        break;\n}\n// ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n```"
