    "The root cause of this bug is that the `manageDependencies` method in the `JSModuleGraph` class does not correctly sort the dependencies. The `manageDependencies` method is responsible for sorting the dependencies based on the `dependencyOptions`, but it seems that it is not working correctly in this case.": [
      "Fixing the manageDependencies Method\nOne possible fix is to modify the `manageDependencies` method in the `JSModuleGraph` class to correctly sort the dependencies. We can add a check to ensure that the dependencies are sorted in the correct order, and we can also add some debug logging to help diagnose any issues. Specifically, we can modify the `manageDependencies` method to use a topological sorting algorithm, which is a more robust and efficient algorithm for sorting dependencies.",
      "Modifying the parseInputs Function\nAnother possible fix is to modify the `parseInputs` function to correctly handle the dependencies. We can add a check to ensure that the dependencies are correctly sorted before adding them to the `jsRoot` node, and we can also add some debug logging to help diagnose any issues. Specifically, we can modify the `parseInputs` function to sort the dependencies based on the `dependencyOptions` before adding them to the `jsRoot` node.",
      "Using a Custom Comparator for Dependency Sorting\nA third possible fix is to use a custom comparator for dependency sorting in the `manageDependencies` method. We can create a custom comparator that takes into account the `dependencyOptions` and sorts the dependencies accordingly. This approach would allow us to customize the dependency sorting behavior without modifying the underlying `manageDependencies` method. Specifically, we can create a custom comparator that sorts the dependencies based on the `dependencyOptions` and use it in the `manageDependencies` method."
