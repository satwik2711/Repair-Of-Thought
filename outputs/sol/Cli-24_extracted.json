    "The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `nextLineTabStop` parameter in the `renderWrappedText` function. When the `nextLineTabStop` is greater than or equal to the `width`, the function throws an `IllegalStateException` because it assumes that there is no room for the description. However, this assumption is incorrect, and the function should be able to handle this scenario by adjusting the padding and wrapping the text accordingly.": [
      "Adjust Padding and Wrapping\nOne possible fix is to adjust the padding and wrapping logic in the `renderWrappedText` function. Instead of throwing an `IllegalStateException` when `nextLineTabStop` is greater than or equal to `width`, we can adjust the padding to ensure that there is enough room for the description. We can do this by reducing the padding by the difference between `nextLineTabStop` and `width`. This will allow the function to handle the scenario where `nextLineTabStop` is greater than or equal to `width`.\n\n```java\nif (nextLineTabStop >= width) {\n    int paddingDiff = nextLineTabStop - width;\n    padding = createPadding(nextLineTabStop - paddingDiff);\n}\n```",
      "Increase Width\nAnother possible fix is to increase the `width` parameter to ensure that there is enough room for the description. We can do this by adding a check to see if `nextLineTabStop` is greater than or equal to `width`, and if so, increase the `width` by the difference between `nextLineTabStop` and `width`. This will ensure that there is enough room for the description and prevent the `IllegalStateException` from being thrown.\n\n```java\nif (nextLineTabStop >= width) {\n    width += nextLineTabStop - width;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Wrapping Strategy\nA third possible fix is to use a different wrapping strategy that can handle the scenario where `nextLineTabStop` is greater than or equal to `width`. One possible strategy is to use a word-wrapping algorithm that can wrap the text at word boundaries instead of character boundaries. This will allow the function to handle the scenario where `nextLineTabStop` is greater than or equal to `width` and prevent the `IllegalStateException` from being thrown.\n\n```java\n// Implement a word-wrapping algorithm\n// ...\n```"
