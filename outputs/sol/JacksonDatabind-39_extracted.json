    "The root cause of the bug is that the `deserialize` function is not properly handling unknown properties in the JSON string. The current implementation simply skips all children of the current JSON node, which means it's not able to deserialize the JSON string correctly. The `UnrecognizedPropertyException` is thrown because the deserializer is not able to recognize the field 'location' in the JSON string.": [
      "Ignore Unknown Properties\nWe can modify the `deserialize` function to ignore unknown properties in the JSON string. We can do this by using the `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` feature and setting it to false. This will allow the deserializer to ignore unknown properties and continue deserializing the JSON string. However, this approach may lead to data loss if the unknown properties are important.",
      "Use a Custom Deserializer\nWe can create a custom deserializer that extends the `StdDeserializer` class and overrides the `handleUnknownProperty` method. In this method, we can ignore unknown properties and continue deserializing the JSON string. This approach provides more control over the deserialization process and allows us to handle unknown properties in a custom way.",
      "Use a JsonNode to Deserialize\nWe can modify the `deserialize` function to use a `JsonNode` to deserialize the JSON string. We can use the `JsonParser` to parse the JSON string into a `JsonNode`, and then use the `JsonNode` to deserialize the JSON string into a Java object. This approach provides more flexibility and allows us to handle complex JSON structures. However, it may require additional code to handle the deserialization process.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
      "```java\npublic Object deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\n    JsonNode node = p.readValueAsTree();\n    Object result = ctxt.handleUnknownProperties(node);\n    return result;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other solutions that are also correct."
