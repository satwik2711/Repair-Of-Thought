    "The root cause of the bug is that the `addValue` function catches the `ClassCastException` thrown by the `freqTable` and re-throws an `IllegalArgumentException` instead. This is incorrect because it changes the type of exception that is thrown, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code. The correct behavior would be to let the `ClassCastException` propagate up the call stack.": [
      "Remove the Catch Block\nOne possible fix is to simply remove the catch block that catches the `ClassCastException`. This would allow the exception to propagate up the call stack and be handled by the calling code. This fix is simple and effective, but it may not be desirable if the calling code is not prepared to handle a `ClassCastException`.",
      "Re-throw the ClassCastException\nAnother possible fix is to re-throw the `ClassCastException` instead of throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. This would preserve the original exception type and allow the calling code to handle it correctly. The corrected code would be:\n```java\ntry {\n    Long count = (Long) freqTable.get(obj);\n    if (count == null) {\n        freqTable.put(obj, Long.valueOf(1));\n    } else {\n        freqTable.put(obj, Long.valueOf(count.longValue() + 1));\n    }\n} catch (ClassCastException ex) {\n    throw ex;\n}\n```",
      "Check for Comparability Before Updating the Frequency Table\nA third possible fix is to check if the value is comparable to existing values before updating the frequency table. This can be done by calling the `compareTo` method on the value and catching the `ClassCastException` that is thrown if the value is not comparable. If the value is not comparable, an `IllegalArgumentException` can be thrown with a meaningful error message. The corrected code would be:\n```java\ntry {\n    if (freqTable.isEmpty()) {\n        freqTable.put(obj, Long.valueOf(1));\n    } else {\n        Object firstKey = freqTable.keySet().iterator().next();\n        if (firstKey instanceof Comparable) {\n            ((Comparable) firstKey).compareTo(obj);\n        }\n        Long count = (Long) freqTable.get(obj);\n        if (count == null) {\n            freqTable.put(obj, Long.valueOf(1));\n        } else {\n            freqTable.put(obj, Long.valueOf(count.longValue() + 1));\n        }\n    }\n} catch (ClassCastException ex) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Value not comparable to existing values.\");\n}\n```"
