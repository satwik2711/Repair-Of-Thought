    "The root cause of this bug lies in the way the parser handles the adoption agency algorithm for formatting elements, specifically when encountering an end tag for an anchor element that is not properly closed. The parser is not correctly identifying the furthest block element and is not properly adopting the anchor element, resulting in the loss of attributes for the anchor element.": [
      "Modify the Adoption Agency Algorithm\nModify the adoption agency algorithm to correctly handle the end tag for an anchor element that is not properly closed. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the furthest block element is correctly identified and that the anchor element is properly adopted. Specifically, the parser should check if the current element is an anchor element and if it is not properly closed, it should adopt the anchor element and its attributes to the furthest block element.",
      "Add a Check for Unclosed Anchor Elements\nAdd a check to the parser to detect unclosed anchor elements and handle them correctly. This can be achieved by adding a flag to indicate whether an anchor element is closed or not, and using this flag to determine how to handle the end tag. When the parser encounters an end tag for an anchor element, it should check the flag to see if the anchor element is closed or not. If it is not closed, the parser should adopt the anchor element and its attributes to the furthest block element.",
      "Improve the Error Handling Mechanism\nImprove the error handling mechanism of the parser to provide more informative error messages when encountering an unclosed anchor tag. This can be achieved by adding more detailed error messages and providing more context about the error. Specifically, the parser should provide an error message indicating that an unclosed anchor tag was encountered and provide information about the anchor element and its attributes. This will help developers to identify and fix the issue more easily."
