    "The root cause of this bug is likely due to integer overflow when calculating the numerator multiplied by 100. The `multiply(100)` function is not shown in the provided code, but it is likely that it multiplies the numerator by 100, which can cause an integer overflow when the numerator is large. This overflow results in a negative value, which is then divided by the denominator, resulting in an incorrect percentage value.": [
      "Avoid Integer Overflow by Using Double Multiplication\nInstead of multiplying the numerator by 100 using integer arithmetic, we can convert the numerator to a double before multiplying. This will prevent the integer overflow and ensure that the correct percentage value is calculated. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic double percentageValue() {\n    return (double) numerator * 100 / denominator;\n}\n```\nThis code converts the numerator to a double before multiplying by 100, preventing the integer overflow and ensuring that the correct percentage value is calculated.",
      "Use a Larger Data Type for the Numerator\nIf we are using a 32-bit integer for the numerator, we can consider using a 64-bit integer instead. This will provide a larger range of values and reduce the likelihood of integer overflow. However, this solution may require changing the data type of the numerator, which could have other implications.",
      "Check for Overflow Before Multiplying\nWe can add a check before multiplying the numerator by 100 to see if the result would overflow. If it would, we can handle the overflow explicitly, for example by throwing an exception or returning an error value. This solution is more complex and may not be necessary if we can avoid the overflow altogether. The corrected code would be:\n```java\npublic double percentageValue() {\n    if (numerator > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 100) {\n        throw new ArithmeticException(\"Integer overflow\");\n    }\n    return multiply(100).doubleValue();\n}\n```\nThis code checks if the numerator is greater than the maximum value that can be multiplied by 100 without overflowing, and throws an exception if it is."
