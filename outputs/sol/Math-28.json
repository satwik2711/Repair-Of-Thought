For example, the function could use the `Dantzig` pivot rule, which chooses the row with the smallest index when there are ties in the minimum ratio test. This pivot rule is less prone to cycling than the current implementation and can help to prevent the infinite loop that is causing the bug.\n\nSuggestion 3: Add a Degeneracy Check\nA third possible fix is to add a degeneracy check to the `getPivotRow` function.
