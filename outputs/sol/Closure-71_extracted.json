    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `checkPropertyVisibility` is not correctly handling the case where a private property is overridden with a non-private property in a different file. Specifically, the function is reporting an incorrect error type (`JSC_PRIVATE_OVERRIDE` instead of `JSC_BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS`) when it encounters this scenario.": [
      "Correct Error Reporting Logic\nThe function `checkPropertyVisibility` should be modified to report an error of type `JSC_BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS` when it encounters a private property being overridden with a non-private property in a different file. This can be achieved by modifying the error reporting logic in the function to use the correct error type. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE && !sameInput) {\n    compiler.report(\n        t.makeError(getprop, BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS,\n            objectType.toString()));\n}\n```\nThis change ensures that the correct error type is reported when a private property is overridden with a non-private property in a different file.",
      "Add Additional Checks\nThe function `checkPropertyVisibility` should be modified to add additional checks to ensure that the correct error type is reported. For example, the function could check whether the property being accessed is a private property and whether it is being overridden with a non-private property in a different file. If both conditions are true, the function could report an error of type `JSC_BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS`. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE && !sameInput && parent.getType() == Token.ASSIGN) {\n    compiler.report(\n        t.makeError(getprop, BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS,\n            objectType.toString()));\n}\n```\nThis change adds an additional check to ensure that the correct error type is reported when a private property is overridden with a non-private property in a different file.",
      "Modify Error Type in Specific Condition\nThe function `checkPropertyVisibility` should be modified to report an error of type `JSC_BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS` when a private property is overridden with a non-private property in a different file, and the parent node is an assignment node. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (isOverride && visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE && !sameInput) {\n    compiler.report(\n        t.makeError(getprop, BAD_PRIVATE_PROPERTY_ACCESS,\n            objectType.toString()));\n} else if (isOverride && visibility == Visibility.PRIVATE) {\n    compiler.report(\n        t.makeError(getprop, PRIVATE_OVERRIDE,\n            objectType.toString()));\n}\n```\nThis change modifies the error type reported by the function in a specific condition, ensuring that the correct error type is reported when a private property is overridden with a non-private property in a different file."
