    "The root cause of the bug is that the function shouldTraverse is not correctly handling the assignment of a function to a property of an object's prototype when the property name is a computed property (i.e., a property name that is computed at runtime). The function is returning false for this type of assignment, which is causing the error.": [
      "Ignore Computed Property Names\nOne potential fix is to ignore computed property names when determining whether to traverse a node. This can be done by adding a check for computed property names and returning true if the property name is computed. This would ensure that the function shouldTraverse correctly handles assignments to computed properties.",
      "Handle Computed Property Names Explicitly\nAnother potential fix is to explicitly handle computed property names in the function shouldTraverse. This can be done by adding a check for computed property names and handling them separately. For example, we could check if the property name is a computed property and if so, return true if the assignment is to a function.",
      "Modify the Condition for Assignments to Prototype Properties\nA third potential fix is to modify the condition for assignments to prototype properties. Currently, the function shouldTraverse returns false if the assignment is to a prototype property or subproperty. We could modify this condition to only return false if the assignment is to a prototype property or subproperty and the property name is not computed. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\nif (parent != null && parent.getType() == Token.ASSIGN) {\n    Node lhs = parent.getFirstChild();\n    Node rhs = lhs.getNext();\n    \n    if (n == lhs) {\n        // Always traverse the left side of the assignment. To handle\n        // nested assignments properly (e.g., (a = this).property = c;),\n        // assignLhsChild should not be overridden.\n        if (assignLhsChild == null) {\n            assignLhsChild = lhs;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Only traverse the right side if it's not an assignment to a prototype\n        // property or subproperty, unless the property name is computed.\n        if (lhs.getType() == Token.GETPROP &&\n            lhs.getLastChild().getString().equals(\"prototype\") &&\n            !lhs.getLastChild().isComputed()) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (lhs.getQualifiedName() != null && lhs.getQualifiedName().contains(\".prototype.\") &&\n            !lhs.getQualifiedName().contains(\"[\") && !lhs.getQualifiedName().contains(\"]\")) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"
