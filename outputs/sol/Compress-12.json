This can be done by wrapping the parsing code in a try-catch block and returning a default or error value if an exception is caught.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a More Robust Parsing Method\nThe `parseOctal` method can be replaced with a more robust parsing method that can handle invalid or malformed octal values. This can be done by using a regular expression or a parsing library that can handle errors more gracefully.\n\nSuggestion 4: Add Error Handling to `getNextTarEntry`\nThe `getNextTarEntry` method can be modified to add error handling for the case where the `TarArchiveEntry` constructor throws an exception. This can be done by wrapping the constructor call in a try-catch block and returning a default or error value if an exception is caught.\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Validating Proposed Solutions\",\n    \"content\": \"Each of the proposed solutions has its own trade-offs and potential pitfalls.

This can be done by checking the header for invalid or malformed values, such as invalid octal values.

This can be done by wrapping the parsing code in a try-catch block and returning a default or error value if an exception is caught. The caught exception can be logged or reported to provide additional information about the error.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a More Robust Parsing Method\nThe `parseOctal` method can be replaced with a more robust parsing method that can handle invalid or malformed octal values.
