    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `add` is not correctly handling the case where the day of the month is 29 and the month is February. When we add a month to February 29, the function should correctly handle the case where the resulting month is not a leap year, and therefore does not have 29 days. However, the function is currently not doing this, and is instead trying to set the day of the month to 29 in a non-leap year, which is causing the error.": [
      "Handle February 29th case explicitly\nWe can add a special case to the function `add` to handle the case where the day of the month is 29 and the month is February. In this case, we can check if the resulting month is a leap year, and if not, set the day of the month to 28. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if the day of the month is 29 and the month is February, and if so, adjust the day of the month accordingly.",
      "Use a more robust date calculation algorithm\nWe can replace the current date calculation algorithm with a more robust one that correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the day of the month is 29 and the month is February. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides a more robust date calculation algorithm, or by implementing a custom algorithm that takes into account all possible cases.",
      "Validate the input `ReadablePartial` object\nWe can add validation to the function `add` to ensure that the input `ReadablePartial` object is a `MonthDay` object, and that the field index is valid. This will prevent the function from being called with invalid input, and will also prevent the error from occurring. We can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input object is valid, and if not, throw an exception or return an error message."
