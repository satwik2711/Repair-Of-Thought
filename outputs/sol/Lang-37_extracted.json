    "The root cause of the bug is that the function is not checking if the types of the two input arrays are compatible before trying to store the elements of the second array in the new array. The function is using the type of the first array to create the new array, but it's not checking if the second array's type is a subclass of the first array's type. This is causing the ArrayStoreException when trying to store a Long in an Integer array.": [
      "Check for Compatible Types\nWe can add a check to ensure that the type of the second array is a subclass of the type of the first array. If not, we can throw an IllegalArgumentException with a meaningful error message. Here's an example of how we can implement this check:\n```java\nif (array1 != null && array2 != null) {\n    final Class<?> type1 = array1.getClass().getComponentType();\n    if (!type1.isAssignableFrom(array2.getClass().getComponentType())) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Incompatible types: \" + type1.getName() + \" and \" + array2.getClass().getComponentType().getName());\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Use a More General Type\nAnother approach is to use a more general type for the new array, such as Object[]. This would allow us to store elements of any type in the new array, without worrying about type compatibility. However, this approach may not be desirable if we need to maintain the type safety of the original arrays.\n```java\nT[] joinedArray = (T[]) Array.newInstance(Object.class, array1.length + array2.length);\n```",
      "Clone the Arrays with a Specific Type\nWe can also clone the arrays with a specific type, such as Number[]. This would allow us to store elements of any type that is a subclass of Number, such as Integer and Long. Here's an example of how we can implement this:\n```java\nT[] joinedArray = (T[]) Array.newInstance(Number.class, array1.length + array2.length);\n```"
