The function `createCopy` is supposed to create a new time series by copying a subset of the data in the original time series. The trigger test `testBug1864222` is trying to create a copy of the time series from December 1, 2005, to January 18, 2006. However, the error message indicates that the start date is after the end date, which is not the case. This suggests that there might be an issue with the date comparison or the indexing logic.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue lies in the way the `startIndex` and `endIndex` are calculated.
