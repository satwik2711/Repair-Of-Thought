The function `createCopy` is supposed to create a new time series by copying a subset of the data in the current time series. The trigger test `testBug1864222` is trying to create a copy of the time series from December 1, 2005, to January 18, 2006. However, the error message indicates that the start date is after the end date, which is not the case. This suggests that there might be an issue with the date comparison or the indexing logic in the `createCopy` function.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue lies in the way the `startIndex` and `endIndex` are calculated. When the `start` or `end` date is not found in the time series, the `getIndex` method returns a negative value, which is then adjusted to point to the first item after the `start` or `end` date. However, this adjustment is not correct when the `start` or `end` date is before the first item or after the last item in the time series. This leads to incorrect indexing and ultimately causes the `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Exploring Potential Fixes\",\n    \"content\": \"To fix this bug, we need to correct the indexing logic when the `start` or `end` date is not found in the time series.
