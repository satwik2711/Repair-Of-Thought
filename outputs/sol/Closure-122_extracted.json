    "The issue lies in the fact that the function `handleBlockComment` only checks for '/* @' or '\\n * @' at the beginning of the comment value. However, in the trigger test, the '@type {number}' is not at the beginning of the comment value, but rather on a new line. This means that the function is not correctly identifying the JSDoc comment.": [
      "Check for '@' symbol anywhere in the comment value\nInstead of only checking for '/* @' or '\\n * @' at the beginning of the comment value, we can check for the '@' symbol anywhere in the comment value. This can be done by using the `indexOf` method without specifying a starting index. However, this approach may also match non-JSDoc comments that contain the '@' symbol.",
      "Use a regular expression to match JSDoc comments\nWe can use a regular expression to match JSDoc comments. This would allow us to correctly identify JSDoc comments even when the '@' symbol is not at the beginning of the comment value. The regular expression can be designed to match the specific pattern of JSDoc comments, reducing the likelihood of false positives.",
      "Check for '@' symbol on a new line\nWe can check if the comment value contains '\\n * @' anywhere, not just at the beginning. This would allow us to correctly identify JSDoc comments even when the '@' symbol is on a new line. This approach is simple and effective, and it does not require significant changes to the existing code. The modified code would be:\n```java\nprivate void handleBlockComment(Comment comment) {\n  if (comment.getValue().indexOf(\"/* @\") != -1 || comment.getValue().contains(\"\\n * @\")) {\n    errorReporter.warning(\n        SUSPICIOUS_COMMENT_WARNING,\n        sourceName,\n        comment.getLineno(), \"\", 0);\n  }\n}\n```"
