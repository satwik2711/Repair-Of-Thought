    "The root cause of the bug is that the function visitGetProp is not correctly handling the case where the object being accessed is null. The function is checking if the child type is a dictionary, and if not, it checks if the parent node is an assignment. However, it does not explicitly check if the object is null before trying to access its properties. This is causing the function to not report an error when a property is accessed on a null object.": [
      "Add Null Check\nWe can add a null check before trying to access the properties of the object. If the object is null, we can report an error immediately. This can be done by adding a simple if statement at the beginning of the function. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nif (childType.isNull()) {\n    report(t, property, TypeValidator.ILLEGAL_PROPERTY_ACCESS, \"'.'\", \"null\");\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the object is null and reports an error.",
      "Modify Validator Expectation\nAnother possible fix is to modify the validator expectation to include null as a possible type. This can be done by changing the line `validator.expectNotNullOrUndefined(t, n, childType, \"No properties on this expression\", getNativeType(OBJECT_TYPE))` to `validator.expectNotNullOrUndefinedOrNull(t, n, childType, \"No properties on this expression\", getNativeType(OBJECT_TYPE))`. This will allow the function to correctly handle the case where the object is null.",
      "Add Special Case for Null in Validator\nWe can also add a special case for null objects in the validator by adding an additional condition to the `expectNotNullOrUndefined` method. This can be done by modifying the method to check if the type is null and report an error if it is. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nif (childType.isNull()) {\n    validator.expectNotNullOrUndefined(t, n, childType, \"No properties on this expression\", getNativeType(OBJECT_TYPE));\n    report(t, property, TypeValidator.ILLEGAL_PROPERTY_ACCESS, \"'.'\", \"null\");\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the object is null and reports an error."
