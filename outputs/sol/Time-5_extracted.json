    "The root cause of the bug is that the `PeriodType` 'months' does not support the 'years' field. When the function tries to set the 'years' field on the result period, it throws an `UnsupportedOperationException` because the 'years' field is not supported by the 'months' period type.": [
      "Check PeriodType Before Setting Years\nOne possible fix is to check the `PeriodType` before setting the 'years' field on the result period. If the `PeriodType` is 'months', we can skip setting the 'years' field. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (years != 0 && type != PeriodType.months()) {\n    result = result.withYears(years);\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that the function does not try to set the 'years' field on the result period when the `PeriodType` is 'months'.",
      "Use a Different PeriodType\nAnother possible fix is to use a different `PeriodType` that supports the 'years' field. For example, we can use the `PeriodType.yearMonthDayTime()` instead of `PeriodType.months()`. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nPeriod result = new Period(millis, PeriodType.yearMonthDayTime(), ISOChronology.getInstanceUTC());\n```\nThis fix ensures that the function can set the 'years' field on the result period without throwing an exception.",
      "Normalize Years to Months\nA third possible fix is to normalize the 'years' field to 'months' before setting it on the result period. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (years != 0) {\n    int months = years * 12;\n    result = result.withMonths(months);\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that the function can set the 'months' field on the result period without throwing an exception."
