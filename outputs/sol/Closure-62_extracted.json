    "The issue is with the condition `if (excerpt.equals(LINE) && 0 <= charno && charno < sourceExcerpt.length())` in the `format` function. This condition is checking if the excerpt is a single line and if the character number is within the bounds of the excerpt. However, this condition is not sufficient to handle cases where the error is at the end of the line. In such cases, the `charno` variable is equal to the length of the excerpt, which causes the condition to fail and the caret symbol to not be appended.": [
      "Relax the Condition\nOne possible fix is to relax the condition to allow for cases where the error is at the end of the line. This can be done by changing the condition to `if (excerpt.equals(LINE) && 0 <= charno && charno <= sourceExcerpt.length())`. This will ensure that the caret symbol is appended even when the error is at the end of the line.",
      "Handle Edge Case\nAnother possible fix is to handle the edge case where the error is at the end of the line separately. This can be done by adding a separate condition to check if the `charno` variable is equal to the length of the excerpt, and if so, append the caret symbol. This can be achieved by adding an additional `if` statement after the existing condition, like this: `if (charno == sourceExcerpt.length()) { b.append(\"^\\n\"); }`.",
      "Use a Different Approach\nA different approach to fix the issue is to use a different method to calculate the padding and append the caret symbol. For example, instead of using the `charno` variable, we can use the `indexOf` method to find the position of the error in the excerpt and append the caret symbol accordingly. This can be achieved by replacing the existing padding and caret symbol code with the following: `int index = sourceExcerpt.indexOf(error.description); for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) { char c = sourceExcerpt.charAt(i); if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) { b.append(c); } else { b.append(' '); } } b.append(\"^\\n\");`."
