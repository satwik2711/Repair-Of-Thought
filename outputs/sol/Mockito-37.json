However, the test is expected to fail fast when calling the real method on an interface. The error message indicates that the test failed because it did not throw the expected MockitoException. Instead, it threw an AssertionFailedError, which suggests that the test did not behave as expected.

This can be done by adding a new if statement to the validate method. The code would look like this:\n```java\nif (invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().isInterface()) {\n    throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface\");\n}\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and easy to implement, and it correctly handles the case where the answer is to call the real method on an interface.\n\nSuggestion 2: Modify the ThrowsException Check\nModify the check for ThrowsException to also check if the invocation is on an interface. If it is, throw a MockitoException. This can be done by modifying the existing if statement to include an additional check. The code would look like this:\n```java\nif (answer instanceof ThrowsException && invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().isInterface()) {\n    throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface\");\n}\n```\nThis solution modifies an existing check, which could potentially introduce bugs if not done carefully.

If it is found, throw a MockitoException. This can be done by adding a new class that implements the Answer interface, and then modifying the validate method to check for this type. The code would look like this:\n```java\npublic class CallRealMethodOnInterface implements Answer {\n    // implementation\n}\n\n// in the validate method\nif (answer instanceof CallRealMethodOnInterface) {\n    throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface\");\n}\n```\nThis solution adds a new answer type, which could add complexity to the code.
