    "The NullPointerException occurs because the XYItemRenderer 'r' is null when the function tries to access its annotations. This happens because the getRendererForDataset function returns null for the given dataset.": [
      "Add a Null Check\nAdd a null check before accessing the annotations of the renderer. This can be done by checking if the renderer 'r' is null before trying to access its annotations. If 'r' is null, the function can skip the annotation access and continue with the rest of the calculation. This will prevent the NullPointerException and ensure the function works as expected.",
      "Ensure Dataset is Mapped to Renderer\nEnsure that the dataset is properly mapped to a renderer. This can be done by checking the mapping of datasets to renderers and ensuring that the dataset is included in the mapping. If the dataset is not mapped to a renderer, the function can either add a default renderer for the dataset or ignore the dataset in the range calculation.",
      "Initialize Renderer for Dataset\nInitialize a renderer for the dataset if it is not already mapped to one. This can be done by creating a new instance of an XYItemRenderer and assigning it to the dataset. This will ensure that the dataset has a renderer and the function can access its annotations without throwing a NullPointerException. The type of renderer to be initialized will depend on the specific requirements of the application."
