    "The root cause of the bug is that the `parseArguments` function is not correctly handling the `--version` flag. The function is checking if the parameter is in the `TRUES` or `FALSES` lists, but it is not checking for the `--version` flag specifically. As a result, the function is returning 1, indicating that the compiler should run, instead of returning 0.": [
      "Add Special Handling for --version Flag\nOne possible fix is to add special handling for the `--version` flag in the `parseArguments` function. We can add a check for the `--version` flag and return 0 immediately if it is found. This will ensure that the compiler does not run when the `--version` flag is provided. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (param.equals(\"--version\")) {\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, but it may not be the most robust solution.",
      "Modify the TRUES List to Include --version\nAnother possible fix is to modify the `TRUES` list to include the `--version` flag. This will ensure that the function returns 0 when the `--version` flag is provided, without requiring special handling. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nprivate static final List<String> TRUES = Arrays.asList(\"true\", \"yes\", \"on\", \"--version\");\n```\nThis fix is also simple, but it may not be the most elegant solution.",
      "Use a More Robust Way to Check for Flags\nA more robust fix would be to use a more robust way to check for flags, such as using a regular expression or a flag parsing library. This would ensure that the function correctly handles all possible flags, not just the `--version` flag. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (param.matches(\"^--version$\")) {\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis fix is more robust, but it may be overkill for this specific problem."
