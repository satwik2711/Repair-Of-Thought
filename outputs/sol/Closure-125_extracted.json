    "The root cause of the bug is that the `visitNew` function is not properly handling the case where the constructor type is not a valid function type. Specifically, when the constructor type is an interface type that is implemented by multiple constructors, the `toMaybeFunctionType` method returns a function type that does not have an instance type. This causes the `getInstanceType` method to throw an `IllegalStateException`.": [
      "Check for Interface Type\nWe can add a check to see if the constructor type is an interface type before trying to get its instance type. If it is an interface type, we can skip the `ensureTyped` call and avoid the `IllegalStateException`. This fix would involve adding a new method to the `JSType` class to check if a type is an interface type.",
      "Use a Different Method to Get Instance Type\nInstead of using the `getInstanceType` method, we can use a different method to get the instance type of the constructor. For example, we can use the `getImplicitPrototype` method to get the implicit prototype of the constructor, which can be used to get the instance type. This fix would involve modifying the `visitNew` function to use the `getImplicitPrototype` method instead of `getInstanceType`.",
      "Add a Null Check\nWe can add a null check to ensure that the `fnType` variable is not null before trying to get its instance type. This fix would involve adding a simple null check to the `visitNew` function. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nprivate void visitNew(NodeTraversal t, Node n) {\n  Node constructor = n.getFirstChild();\n  JSType type = getJSType(constructor).restrictByNotNullOrUndefined();\n  if (type.isConstructor() || type.isEmptyType() || type.isUnknownType()) {\n    FunctionType fnType = type.toMaybeFunctionType();\n    if (fnType != null) {\n      visitParameterList(t, n, fnType);\n      if (fnType.getInstanceType() != null) {\n        ensureTyped(t, n, fnType.getInstanceType());\n      } else {\n        ensureTyped(t, n);\n      }\n    } else {\n      ensureTyped(t, n);\n    }\n  } else {\n    report(t, n, NOT_A_CONSTRUCTOR);\n    ensureTyped(t, n);\n  }\n}\n```"
