    "The root cause of the bug is that the `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` feature is enabled, which allows empty strings to be deserialized as null objects. However, the `_deserializeTypedUsingDefaultImpl` function is not handling this case correctly. When an empty string is encountered, the function is expecting a property that contains the type id, but since the string is empty, this property is missing, causing the deserialization to fail.": [
      "Handle Empty Strings Explicitly\nOne possible fix is to add an explicit check for empty strings in the `_deserializeTypedUsingDefaultImpl` function. If an empty string is encountered, the function can return null immediately, without attempting to deserialize the string. This would require adding a simple if statement at the beginning of the function. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprotected Object _deserializeTypedUsingDefaultImpl(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt,\n        TokenBuffer tb) throws IOException\n{\n    if (p.getText().isEmpty()) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    // ... rest of the function remains the same ...\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Deserialization Logic\nAnother possible fix is to modify the deserialization logic to handle empty strings correctly. This could involve adding a new deserialization method that is specifically designed to handle empty strings, or modifying the existing method to handle this case correctly. This would require a more significant change to the code, but could provide a more robust solution. For example, the function could be modified to check if the current token is a `JsonToken.VALUE_STRING` and if the string is empty, return null immediately.",
      "Disable the ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT Feature\nA third possible fix is to disable the `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` feature when deserializing data that may contain empty strings. This would prevent the deserialization process from attempting to deserialize empty strings as null objects, which would avoid the error. However, this may not be a desirable solution if the feature is required for other parts of the application. The feature can be disabled by removing the `enable(DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT)` line from the `ObjectMapper` configuration."
