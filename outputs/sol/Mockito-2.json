Then analyse the root cause and finally try to provide a repair suggestions to fix the buggy.\nNote that the bug can be fixed by modifying only the given buggy code; do not attempt to modify the class, add new functions, or conduct further testing.\n\n1. Buggy Function: \n\npublic Timer(long durationMillis) {\n        this.durationMillis = durationMillis;\n    }\n\n2. Trigger Test: \n    public void should_throw_exception_when_duration_is_negative_for_timeout_method() {\n\n        try {\n\n            Mockito.timeout(-1);\n\n            Assert.fail(\"It is forbidden to invoke Mockito.timeout() with negative value.\");\n\n        } catch (FriendlyReminderException e) {\n\n            Assert.assertTrue(true);\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n3.
