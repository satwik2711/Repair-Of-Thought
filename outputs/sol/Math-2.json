        "reasoning_steps": "Step 1: Analyzing Trigger Test and Error Message\nThe trigger test is designed to verify that the sample generated by the HypergeometricDistribution class falls within the valid range of 0 to n. However, the error message indicates that the sample value is -50, which is outside this range. This suggests that there might be an issue with the calculation of the sample or the mean value in the HypergeometricDistribution class.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Root Cause of Buggy Function\nRoot Cause: The issue lies in the getNumericalMean() function, which calculates the mean of the Hypergeometric distribution. The function uses the formula (n * m) / N, but it does not handle the case where the result is negative due to integer overflow. Since the variables n, m, and N are integers, the multiplication of n and m can exceed the maximum limit of an integer, resulting in a negative value. This negative value is then assigned to the sample variable, causing the assertion error.\n\nStep 3: Response\n{\"title\": \"Exploring Potential Fixes\", \"content\": \"Based on the analysis of the root cause, we can explore the following potential fixes:\", \"next_action\": \"continue\"}\n\nassistant: {\"title\": \"Suggestion 1: Using Long Data Type for Intermediate Calculations\", \"content\": \"One possible solution is to use the long data type for the intermediate calculations in the getNumericalMean() function.
