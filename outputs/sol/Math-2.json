    "solutions": [
      "To analyze the issue, let's first break down the problem:\n\n1. **Buggy Function Analysis**:\n   - The function `getNumericalMean()` calculates the mean of a hypergeometric distribution using the formula `n * m / N`, where `N` is the population size, `m` is the number of successes in the population, and `n` is the sample size.\n   \n2. **Trigger Test Analysis**:\n   - The test `testMath1021()` creates a `HypergeometricDistribution` with very large `N` and `m`, and a relatively small `n`.\n   - It performs random sampling 100 times and checks if each sample is between 0 and `n`.\n   - The error occurs when a sample value of `-50` is produced, which is invalid as the number of successes sampled should not be negative.\n\n3. **Error Message Analysis**:\n   - The error message indicates that a sample of `-50` was generated, violating the assertion that samples should be non-negative.\n\n**Root Cause**: The calculation of the mean using integer arithmetic in the expression `(getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses())` before casting to `double` can lead to overflow, especially with large values of `getNumberOfSuccesses()` and `getSampleSize()`. This results in an incorrect mean, which affects the distribution and sampling, potentially leading to negative sample values.\n\n**Patch Suggestions**:\n\n**Suggestion 1: Correct Order of Type Casting**\n   - Before performing the multiplication, cast the integers to `double` to prevent overflow, ensuring that arithmetic is done in the floating-point domain:\n   ```java\n   public double getNumericalMean() {\n       return ((double) getSampleSize() * (double) getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Suggestion 2: Use Long for Intermediate Calculation**\n   - Use `long` for intermediate calculations to handle larger numbers without overflow, followed by casting to `double` for the final division:\n   ```java\n   public double getNumericalMean() {\n       return ((double) ((long) getSampleSize() * (long) getNumberOfSuccesses())) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n   }\n   ```\n\n**Suggestion 3: Intermediate Variable with Casting**\n   - Introduce an intermediate variable with `double` casting prior to multiplication to ensure no overflow occurs:\n   ```java\n   public double getNumericalMean() {\n       double sampleSize = (double) getSampleSize();\n       double numberOfSuccesses = (double) getNumberOfSuccesses();\n       return (sampleSize * numberOfSuccesses) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n   }\n   ```\n\nAny of these suggestions would resolve the overflow issue, leading to a correct calculation of the mean and preventing negative samples from being generated in the distribution."
