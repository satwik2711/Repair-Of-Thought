        "reasoning_steps": "Step 1: Analyzing Trigger Test and Error Message\nThe trigger test, `testMath1021`, creates a `HypergeometricDistribution` instance with a population size `N` of 43130568, number of successes `m` of 42976365, and a sample size `n` of 50. It then samples from this distribution 100 times, asserting that each sample is within the range [0, n]. The error message indicates that one of these assertions failed because a sample was -50, which is less than 0. This suggests an issue with the sampling process or the distribution's parameters.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Root Cause\nRoot Cause: The issue lies in the calculation of the mean in the `getNumericalMean` method. The current implementation returns `(double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize()`, which can lead to precision issues due to integer division and the large numbers involved. However, the direct cause of the negative sample is more likely related to how the distribution is used or calculated rather than the mean calculation itself. The error in the test suggests that the distribution's sampling method is producing invalid results, possibly due to an incorrect implementation or parameters. Given the nature of the Hypergeometric Distribution, the calculation of probabilities and the sampling process might be where the error originates, potentially influenced by the mean calculation.\n\nStep 3: Exploring Potential Fixes\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that the sampling process is correct and that the distribution's parameters are properly handled. Since the error message points to an issue with sampling, let's consider how the `getNumericalMean` method might indirectly affect this, possibly through influencing other calculations within the distribution. However, without modifying the class or adding functions, our focus should be on adjusting the `getNumericalMean` method to better handle the large numbers and potential precision issues.\n\nStep 4: Validating Proposed Solutions\nConsidering the large numbers involved, one potential issue could be the order of operations and the precision of the division. Ensuring that the division is done in a way that minimizes precision loss is crucial. Let's consider a few approaches to adjust the `getNumericalMean` method to handle these large numbers more accurately.\n\nStep 5: Proposing Repair Suggestions\nSuggestion 1: Improve Division Precision\nThe current method performs integer multiplication followed by division, which could lead to precision issues. Consider rearranging the calculation to minimize integer division: `return (double) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses() / getPopulationSize();` This ensures that at least one of the operands is a double before the division, potentially reducing precision loss.\n\nSuggestion 2: Avoid Potential Overflow\nGiven the large numbers, there's a risk of overflow in the multiplication. Using `long` for the multiplication could help: `return (double) ((long) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / getPopulationSize();` This suggestion aims to prevent overflow by promoting the multiplication to `long` before the division.\n\nSuggestion 3: Rethink the Calculation Approach\nIf the above suggestions do not resolve the issue, reconsider the formula itself. The mean of a hypergeometric distribution is indeed `n * m / N`, but ensure this formula is correctly applied in the context of the class and its methods. Perhaps the issue lies not in the precision but in how `getSampleSize()`, `getNumberOfSuccesses()`, or `getPopulationSize()` are defined or calculated, suggesting a review of these methods might be necessary.",

The large numbers involved in the calculation can cause integer overflow or precision loss, especially when performing integer division.

Consider rearranging the calculation to minimize integer division: `return (double) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses() / getPopulationSize();` This ensures that at least one of the operands is a double before the division, potentially reducing precision loss. By casting one of the operands to a double, we ensure that the division operation is performed using floating-point arithmetic, which can handle the large numbers more accurately.\n\nSuggestion 2: Avoid Potential Overflow\nGiven the large numbers, there's a risk of overflow in the multiplication. Using `long` for the multiplication could help: `return (double) ((long) getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / getPopulationSize();` This suggestion aims to prevent overflow by promoting the multiplication to `long` before the division. However, since the numbers are very large, even `long` might not be sufficient, and this approach might still lead to overflow.\n\nSuggestion 3: Rethink the Calculation Approach\nIf the above suggestions do not resolve the issue, reconsider the formula itself. The mean of a hypergeometric distribution is indeed `n * m / N`, but ensure this formula is correctly applied in the context of the class and its methods.

Ensure that these methods return the correct values and that the formula is applied consistently throughout the class.\n\nSuggestion 4: Use BigDecimal for High-Precision Arithmetic\nFor calculations involving very large numbers where precision is critical, consider using `BigDecimal` instead of primitive types. This would involve modifying the `getNumericalMean` method to use `BigDecimal` for the calculation: `return BigDecimal.valueOf(getSampleSize()).multiply(BigDecimal.valueOf(getNumberOfSuccesses())).divide(BigDecimal.valueOf(getPopulationSize()), MathContext.DECIMAL128);` This approach provides high-precision arithmetic and can handle very large numbers without overflow or precision loss, making it suitable for calculations involving large population sizes and sample sizes. However, it may come at the cost of performance compared to using primitive types.",
