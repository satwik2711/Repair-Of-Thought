    "The issue arises from the calculation of the new buffer length in the `expandCurrentSegment` method. When the current buffer length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`, the new length is set to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN + 1`, which is incorrect because it does not actually increase the buffer size. This is due to the fact that the `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` is likely a power of 2 (262144 in this case), and adding 1 to it does not change the buffer size when copying the array using `Arrays.copyOf`.": [
      "Increase Buffer Size by a Fixed Amount\nIncrease the buffer size by a fixed amount (e.g., 1024) when the current length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`. This ensures that the buffer size always increases, even when the current length is close to the maximum segment length. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] expandCurrentSegment()\n{\n    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;\n    final int len = curr.length;\n    int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ? (MAX_SEGMENT_LEN + 1024) : Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len + (len >> 1));\n    return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, newLen));\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Growth Strategy\nInstead of growing the buffer size by 50% or 25%, use a different growth strategy, such as doubling the buffer size when it reaches the maximum segment length. This approach ensures that the buffer size increases rapidly, even when the current length is close to the maximum segment length. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] expandCurrentSegment()\n{\n    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;\n    final int len = curr.length;\n    int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ? (MAX_SEGMENT_LEN * 2) : Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len + (len >> 1));\n    return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, newLen));\n}\n```",
      "Handle Maximum Segment Length as a Special Case\nHandle the case where the current buffer length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` as a special case. In this case, increase the buffer size by a fixed amount (e.g., 1024) or use a different growth strategy to ensure that the buffer size increases correctly. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic char[] expandCurrentSegment()\n{\n    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;\n    final int len = curr.length;\n    if (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) {\n        return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, MAX_SEGMENT_LEN + 1024));\n    } else {\n        int newLen = Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len + (len >> 1));\n        return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, newLen));\n    }\n}\n```"
