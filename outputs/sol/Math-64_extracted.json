    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is not properly handling the case where the Jacobian matrix is singular or nearly singular. This can cause the algorithm to converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum.": [
      "Add Singularity Check\nOne possible fix is to add a check for singularity or near-singularity of the Jacobian matrix after it is computed. If the matrix is singular or nearly singular, the algorithm can use a different method to compute the update direction, such as the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This can be done by adding a small function that checks the condition number of the Jacobian matrix and returns a flag indicating whether the matrix is singular or not. If the matrix is singular, the algorithm can use the pseudoinverse to compute the update direction.",
      "Use Regularization\nAnother possible fix is to use regularization to prevent the Jacobian matrix from becoming singular or nearly singular. This can be done by adding a small value to the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix. This will ensure that the matrix is always invertible, but it may affect the accuracy of the optimization results. The value of the regularization parameter can be chosen based on the specific problem and the desired level of accuracy.",
      "Modify the Levenberg-Marquardt Parameter Update\nA third possible fix is to modify the way the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter is updated. Instead of using a fixed value for the parameter, it can be updated based on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. If the condition number is large, the parameter can be increased to reduce the step size and prevent the algorithm from converging to a local minimum. This can be done by adding a small function that computes the condition number of the Jacobian matrix and updates the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter accordingly."
