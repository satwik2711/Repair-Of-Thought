    "The issue arises from the fact that the function `formatBigIntegerBinary` is being called with a value that is too large for the given buffer length. This is because the function does not properly handle negative values when determining whether to store the value as an octal string or a binary number. Specifically, the condition `if (length < 9)` is not sufficient to determine whether the value can be stored as a binary number, as it does not take into account the sign of the value.": [
      "Check for Negative Values Before Calling formatBigIntegerBinary\nOne possible fix is to add a check for negative values before calling `formatBigIntegerBinary`. We can add a condition to check if the value is negative and if the buffer length is sufficient to store the value as a binary number. If the value is negative and the buffer length is not sufficient, we can throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. This approach ensures that the function handles negative values correctly and prevents the `IllegalArgumentException` from being thrown.",
      "Modify the Condition for Calling formatBigIntegerBinary\nAnother possible fix is to modify the condition for calling `formatBigIntegerBinary`. Instead of checking if the buffer length is less than 9, we can check if the buffer length is sufficient to store the value as a binary number, taking into account the sign of the value. We can use the `Long.SIZE` constant to determine the number of bits required to store the value, and then check if the buffer length is sufficient to store the value as a binary number. This approach is more robust and ensures that the buffer length is always sufficient to store the value as a binary number.",
      "Use a More Robust Method to Determine the Buffer Length\nA third possible fix is to use a more robust method to determine the buffer length. Instead of relying on the `length` parameter, we can use the `Long.SIZE` constant to determine the number of bits required to store the value, and then calculate the required buffer length based on that. This approach would ensure that the buffer length is always sufficient to store the value as a binary number, regardless of the sign of the value. However, this approach may require additional calculations and may not be as efficient as the other two suggestions."
