    "The root cause of the bug is that the `serializeWithType` method is not correctly handling the type information of the `Bean1385` object. Specifically, the method is not using the correct type serializer for the `Bean1385` object, which is causing the deserialization process to fail.": [
      "Use findTypedValueSerializer\nOne possible fix for this bug is to use the `findTypedValueSerializer` method instead of the `findValueSerializer` method to get the correct type serializer for the `Bean1385` object. This can be done by replacing the line `ser = provider.findValueSerializer(value.getClass(), _property);` with `ser = provider.findTypedValueSerializer(value.getClass(), true, _property);`. This will ensure that the correct type serializer is used for the `Bean1385` object, which will fix the deserialization issue.",
      "Modify Deserialization Process\nAnother possible fix for this bug is to modify the deserialization process to correctly handle the type information of the `Bean1385` object. This can be done by adding additional logic to the deserialization process to correctly handle the type information of the `Bean1385` object. For example, we can add a check to see if the deserialized object is an instance of `Bean1385`, and if so, we can use the correct type serializer to deserialize it.",
      "Use TypeSerializer for Bean1385\nA third possible fix for this bug is to use a custom `TypeSerializer` for the `Bean1385` object. This can be done by creating a custom `TypeSerializer` class that knows how to serialize and deserialize the `Bean1385` object correctly. We can then use this custom `TypeSerializer` in the `serializeWithType` method to serialize the `Bean1385` object. This will ensure that the `Bean1385` object is serialized and deserialized correctly, which will fix the bug."
