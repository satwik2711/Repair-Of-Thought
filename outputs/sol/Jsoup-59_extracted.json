    "The bug is caused by the fact that the `pendingAttributeName` is being trimmed before being used to create a new `Attribute` object. If the `pendingAttributeName` contains only whitespace or control characters, trimming it will result in an empty string, which is not allowed by the `Attribute` constructor. This is exactly what happens in the trigger test case, where the attribute name contains a control code (`\\06`).": [
      "Check for Empty String Before Creating Attribute\nWe can add a simple check before creating the `Attribute` object to ensure that the `pendingAttributeName` is not empty. If it is empty, we can either skip creating the attribute or throw a custom exception to indicate that the attribute name is invalid. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (pendingAttributeName != null && !pendingAttributeName.trim().isEmpty()) {\n    // create Attribute object\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that the `Attribute` constructor is not called with an empty string, preventing the `IllegalArgumentException`.",
      "Use a Different Trimming Approach\nInstead of using the `trim()` method, which removes all whitespace characters, we can use a different approach to remove only the control characters from the `pendingAttributeName`. This would prevent the attribute name from becoming empty. For example, we can use a regular expression to replace control characters with an empty string:\n```java\npendingAttributeName = pendingAttributeName.replaceAll(\"\\\\p{Cntrl}\", \"\");\n```\nThis approach ensures that the attribute name is not empty, even if it contains control characters.",
      "Skip Creating Attribute for Empty Names\nWe can modify the code to skip creating the `Attribute` object if the `pendingAttributeName` is empty after trimming. This approach is simple and effective, but it may not be desirable if the attribute name is required for the application's functionality. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (pendingAttributeName != null) {\n    pendingAttributeName = pendingAttributeName.trim();\n    if (!pendingAttributeName.isEmpty()) {\n        // create Attribute object\n    }\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that the `Attribute` constructor is not called with an empty string, preventing the `IllegalArgumentException`."
