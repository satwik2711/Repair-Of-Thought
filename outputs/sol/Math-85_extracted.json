    "The root cause of the bug is in the do-while loop condition. The condition checks if (fa * fb > 0.0) and if the number of iterations is less than the maximum iterations. However, it also checks if (a > lowerBound) or (b < upperBound), which is incorrect. This condition can cause the loop to terminate prematurely, even if the function has not yet bracketed the root. This is because the loop will terminate as soon as a or b reaches the lower or upper bound, even if the function values at a and b have not yet changed sign.": [
      "Modify the Loop Condition\nModify the do-while loop condition to only check if (fa * fb > 0.0) and if the number of iterations is less than the maximum iterations. This will ensure that the loop continues until the function has bracketed the root or the maximum iterations have been reached.\n\n```java\ndo {\n    a = Math.max(a - 1.0, lowerBound);\n    b = Math.min(b + 1.0, upperBound);\n    fa = function.value(a);\n    fb = function.value(b);\n    numIterations++ ;\n} while ((fa * fb > 0.0) && (numIterations < maximumIterations));\n```",
      "Add Additional Checks\nAdd additional checks after the loop to ensure that the function has bracketed the root correctly. This can include checking if the function values at a and b have changed sign, and if not, throwing a ConvergenceException.\n\n```java\ndo {\n    a = Math.max(a - 1.0, lowerBound);\n    b = Math.min(b + 1.0, upperBound);\n    fa = function.value(a);\n    fb = function.value(b);\n    numIterations++ ;\n} while ((fa * fb > 0.0) && (numIterations < maximumIterations));\n\nif (fa * fb >= 0.0) {\n    throw new ConvergenceException(\"Failed to bracket the root\");\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Bracketing Strategy\nUse a more robust bracketing strategy, such as the bisection method, to find the root of the function. This method is more reliable and less prone to premature termination.\n\n```java\ndouble c = (a + b) / 2.0;\ndouble fc = function.value(c);\n\nif (fa * fc <= 0.0) {\n    b = c;\n} else {\n    a = c;\n}\n\nnumIterations++ ;\n} while ((fa * fb > 0.0) && (numIterations < maximumIterations));\n```"
