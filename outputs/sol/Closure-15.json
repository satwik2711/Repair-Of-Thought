Specifically, we can check if the node is a `delete` statement and if it is part of a `for...in` loop. If so, we can return `true` immediately, indicating that the node has side effects. This can be achieved by adding the following code to the `apply(Node n)` function:\n```java\nif (n.isDelete() && n.getParent().isForIn()) {\n    return true;\n}\n```\nThis code checks if the node is a `delete` statement and if its parent node is a `for...in` loop. If both conditions are true, it returns `true` immediately.\n\nSuggestion 2: Update Control Flow Graph Analysis\nWe can update the control flow graph analysis to take into account the `delete` statement. Specifically, we can add a new edge to the graph to represent the `delete` statement, and update the `apply(Node n)` function to follow this edge when analyzing the graph. This can be achieved by modifying the `ControlFlowGraph` class to include a new edge type for `delete` statements, and updating the `apply(Node n)` function to handle this new edge type.\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a More Conservative Approach\nWe can use a more conservative approach to handling the `delete` statement.
