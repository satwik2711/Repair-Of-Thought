    "The bug is caused by the fact that the RectangularCholeskyDecomposition class does not handle zero rows in the input matrix correctly. In the case of matrix m3, the third row is all zeros, which causes the decomposition to produce incorrect results. The class assumes that the input matrix is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, but it does not check for zero rows. When a zero row is encountered, the decomposition algorithm produces NaN (Not a Number) values, which leads to the assertion failure.": [
      "Check for Zero Rows Before Decomposition\nCheck if any row in the input matrix is all zeros before performing the decomposition. If a zero row is found, skip that row and continue with the next row. This can be done by adding a simple check at the beginning of the decomposition algorithm. The check can be implemented as follows:\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < order; i++) {\n    boolean isZeroRow = true;\n    for (int j = 0; j < order; j++) {\n        if (c[i][j] != 0) {\n            isZeroRow = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (isZeroRow) {\n        // skip this row\n        continue;\n    }\n    // perform decomposition\n}\n```",
      "Modify Decomposition Algorithm to Handle Zero Rows\nModify the decomposition algorithm to handle zero rows correctly. This can be done by checking if the current row is all zeros before performing the decomposition. If the row is all zeros, skip that row and continue with the next row. The modification can be implemented as follows:\n```java\nfor (int i = r; i < order; i++) {\n    boolean isZeroRow = true;\n    for (int j = r; j < order; j++) {\n        if (c[i][j] != 0) {\n            isZeroRow = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (isZeroRow) {\n        // skip this row\n        continue;\n    }\n    // perform decomposition\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Decomposition Algorithm\nUse a more robust decomposition algorithm that can handle zero rows correctly. For example, the LDLT decomposition algorithm can handle zero rows and is more robust than the Cholesky decomposition algorithm. The LDLT decomposition algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n```java\npublic RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(RealMatrix matrix, double small)\n    throws NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException {\n    // ...\n    LDLTDecomposition ldlt = new LDLTDecomposition(matrix);\n    // ...\n}\n```\nNote that the LDLT decomposition algorithm is more complex and may have a higher computational cost than the Cholesky decomposition algorithm."
