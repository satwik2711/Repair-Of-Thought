    "The root cause of the bug is that the `reindexChildren(index)` method is called after adding all child nodes, which causes the indices of the child nodes to be updated incorrectly. This is because the `reindexChildren(index)` method is designed to update the indices of the child nodes after a single child node is added or removed, not after multiple child nodes are added.": [
      "Update reindexChildren Method\nOne possible fix is to update the `reindexChildren(index)` method to correctly handle the addition of multiple child nodes. This can be done by updating the method to iterate over the child nodes and update their indices correctly. However, this approach may require significant changes to the `reindexChildren(index)` method and may have unintended consequences.",
      "Remove reindexChildren Method Call\nAnother possible fix is to remove the call to the `reindexChildren(index)` method from the `addChildren` method. This is because the `reindexChildren(index)` method is not necessary when adding multiple child nodes, as the indices of the child nodes will be updated correctly by the `childNodes.add(index, in)` method. This approach is simpler and less likely to have unintended consequences.",
      "Update addChildren Method to Reindex Children Correctly\nA third possible fix is to update the `addChildren` method to correctly handle the addition of multiple child nodes. This can be done by iterating over the child nodes and adding them to the `childNodes` list in the correct order, and then updating the indices of the child nodes correctly. This approach requires changes to the `addChildren` method, but is less likely to have unintended consequences than updating the `reindexChildren(index)` method."
