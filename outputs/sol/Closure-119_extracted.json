    "The bug is caused by the fact that the `collect` function does not properly handle global names in the context of a `catch` block. Specifically, when a global name is referenced in a `catch` block, the function does not correctly determine whether the name is being set or gotten. This leads to an unexpected warning during the compilation process.": [
      "Add Special Handling for Catch Blocks\nThe `collect` function can be modified to add special handling for `catch` blocks. A new case can be added to the `switch` statement that checks if the parent node is a `catch` block, and if so, handles the global name reference accordingly. This can be achieved by adding the following code:\n```java\ncase Token.CATCH:\n  if (parent != null && parent.isCatch()) {\n    // Handle global name reference in catch block\n    if (isGlobalNameReference(name, scope)) {\n      handleGet(module, scope, n, parent, name);\n    }\n  }\n  break;\n```\nThis modification will ensure that global name references in `catch` blocks are handled correctly, resolving the bug.",
      "Modify the isGlobalNameReference Function\nThe `isGlobalNameReference` function can be modified to take into account the context of a `catch` block. A new parameter can be added to the function that indicates whether the name reference is in a `catch` block, and the function can be modified to return the correct result based on this parameter. This can be achieved by modifying the function as follows:\n```java\npublic boolean isGlobalNameReference(String name, Scope scope, boolean inCatchBlock) {\n  // ...\n  if (inCatchBlock) {\n    // Handle global name reference in catch block\n    return true;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that the `isGlobalNameReference` function correctly handles global name references in `catch` blocks, resolving the bug.",
      "Add a New Function to Handle Catch Blocks\nA new function can be added to specifically handle global name references in `catch` blocks. This function can be called from the `collect` function when a global name reference is encountered in a `catch` block. This can be achieved by adding the following code:\n```java\npublic void handleCatchBlock(JSModule module, Scope scope, Node n, Node parent, String name) {\n  // Handle global name reference in catch block\n  if (isGlobalNameReference(name, scope)) {\n    handleGet(module, scope, n, parent, name);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that global name references in `catch` blocks are handled correctly, resolving the bug."
