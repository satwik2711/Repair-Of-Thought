    "The root cause of the bug is that the `getPivotRow` function does not handle degenerate cases correctly. In a degenerate case, there are multiple rows with the same minimum ratio, and the function should choose one of them based on some rule. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to an infinite loop and eventually exceeding the maximum number of iterations.": [
      "Apply Bland's Rule Correctly\nOne possible fix is to apply Bland's rule correctly when there are multiple rows with the same minimum ratio. This can be done by modifying the `getPivotRow` function to use a lexicographic ordering of the rows when there are ties in the minimum ratio test. Specifically, the function should choose the row with the smallest index when there are ties in the minimum ratio test. This can be achieved by replacing the current implementation of Bland's rule with a new implementation that uses a lexicographic ordering.",
      "Use a Different Pivot Rule\nAnother possible fix is to use a different pivot rule that is less prone to cycling. For example, the function could use the `Dantzig` pivot rule, which chooses the row with the smallest index when there are ties in the minimum ratio test. This pivot rule is less prone to cycling than the current implementation and can help to prevent the infinite loop that is causing the bug.",
      "Add a Degeneracy Check\nA third possible fix is to add a degeneracy check to the `getPivotRow` function. This would involve checking if the current tableau is degenerate before applying the pivot rule, and if so, applying a different rule to handle the degeneracy. For example, the function could use a different pivot rule when the tableau is degenerate, such as the `Dantzig` pivot rule. This can help to prevent the infinite loop that is causing the bug and ensure that the function handles degenerate cases correctly."
