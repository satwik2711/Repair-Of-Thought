    "The issue lies in the way the `revert` function calculates the new direction. The `zero.subtract(direction)` expression is subtracting the direction vector from the zero vector, which is not equivalent to negating the direction vector. This is because subtracting a vector from the zero vector does not change its magnitude, only its direction. However, the direction vector is being subtracted from the zero vector, resulting in a vector with the same magnitude but opposite direction, which is not the expected result.": [
      "Negate the Direction Vector Directly\nThe simplest fix is to directly negate the direction vector using the `negate` method, like this: `final Line reverted = new Line(zero, direction.negate());`. This will correctly reverse the direction of the line.",
      "Use Vector Subtraction Correctly\nAlternatively, we can use vector subtraction correctly by subtracting the direction vector from the zero vector and then negating the result, like this: `final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction).negate());`. However, this approach is less efficient and less readable than the first suggestion.",
      "Use a Temporary Variable for Clarity\nWe can also use a temporary variable to make the code more readable, like this: `Vector3D newDirection = direction.negate(); final Line reverted = new Line(zero, newDirection);`. This approach makes it clear what the code is doing and can make it easier to understand and maintain."
