    "The root cause of the bug is likely due to the fact that the `AdamsMoultonIntegrator` is not correctly implementing the Adams-Moulton method. Specifically, the method is not correctly handling the step size control, which is causing the integrator to evaluate the ODEs more times than expected. This is likely due to a mistake in the implementation of the `filterStep` method, which is used to control the step size.": [
      "Fixing the filterStep Method\nThe `filterStep` method should be modified to correctly handle the step size control, and to prevent the integrator from evaluating the ODEs more times than expected. This can be done by adding a check to ensure that the step size is not too small, and by modifying the method to use a more robust step size control algorithm. The modified method should also take into account the direction of the integration (forward or backward) and the minimum step size allowed.",
      "Modifying the Step Size Control Algorithm\nThe step size control algorithm used in the `AdamsMoultonIntegrator` should be modified to use a more robust method for controlling the step size, such as the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. This can help to prevent the integrator from evaluating the ODEs more times than expected, and can improve the overall performance of the integrator. The PID controller can be implemented by adding three new parameters to the `AdamsMoultonIntegrator`: the proportional gain, the integral gain, and the derivative gain.",
      "Adding a Check for Minimum Step Size\nA check should be added to ensure that the step size is not too small. This can be done by adding a minimum step size parameter to the `AdamsMoultonIntegrator`, and by modifying the `filterStep` method to check that the step size is not less than this minimum value. This can help to prevent the integrator from evaluating the ODEs more times than expected, and can improve the overall performance of the integrator. The minimum step size parameter can be set to a small value, such as 1e-12, to prevent the integrator from taking too small steps."
