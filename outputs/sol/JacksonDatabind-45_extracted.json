    "The root cause of the bug is that the function createContextual is not correctly handling the case where the @JsonFormat annotation has a pattern but no shape specified. When the shape is not specified, the function should default to the shape specified in the pattern, but it is not doing so. Instead, it is returning a JsonSerializer that serializes the date as a numeric timestamp, which is not the expected behavior.": [
      "Add a Default Shape\nOne potential fix is to add a default shape to the function createContextual. If the shape is not specified in the @JsonFormat annotation, the function can default to a shape of STRING. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the @JsonFormat annotation has a pattern but no shape specified. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (format.getShape() == null) {\n    format = format.withShape(JsonFormat.Shape.STRING);\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, but it may not cover all cases.",
      "Check for Pattern\nAnother potential fix is to modify the function createContextual to check if a pattern is specified in the @JsonFormat annotation. If a pattern is specified, the function can assume a shape of STRING, even if no shape is specified. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the @JsonFormat annotation has a pattern but no shape specified. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (format.hasPattern()) {\n    format = format.withShape(JsonFormat.Shape.STRING);\n}\n```\nThis fix is more targeted and only applies when a pattern is specified.",
      "Use a More Robust Method\nA more robust fix would be to use a more robust method to determine the shape of the date. Instead of relying on the shape specified in the @JsonFormat annotation, the function can use a more robust method, such as checking the type of the date field, to determine the shape of the date. This will ensure that the function correctly handles all cases, including the case where the @JsonFormat annotation has a pattern but no shape specified. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (property.getType().isAssignableFrom(Date.class)) {\n    format = format.withShape(JsonFormat.Shape.STRING);\n}\n```\nThis fix is more complex, but it provides a more robust solution that covers all cases."
