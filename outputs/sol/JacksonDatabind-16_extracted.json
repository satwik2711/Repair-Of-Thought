    "The root cause of this bug is that the `_add` method in the buggy function is using the `annotationType()` method to determine the key for the annotation in the `_annotations` map. However, this method returns the type of the annotation, not the name of the property that the annotation is intended to represent. As a result, when the mixin is applied, the wrong property name is being used in the serialized JSON.": [
      "Use Annotation Name as Key\nWe can modify the `_add` method to use the name of the annotation as the key in the `_annotations` map. This can be done by using the `getSimpleName()` method of the `annotationType()` method to get the simple name of the annotation class. Here is the modified code:\n`Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType().getSimpleName(), ann);`",
      "Use Property Name as Key\nAlternatively, we can modify the `_add` method to use the name of the property that the annotation is intended to represent as the key in the `_annotations` map. This can be done by using the `getName()` method of the `ann` object to get the name of the property. Here is the modified code:\n`Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.getName(), ann);`",
      "Use Custom Key Resolver\nAnother approach is to use a custom key resolver to determine the key for the annotation in the `_annotations` map. This can be done by creating a custom class that implements the `KeyResolver` interface and using it to resolve the key for the annotation. Here is an example of how this can be done:\n`public class CustomKeyResolver implements KeyResolver {\n    @Override\n    public String resolveKey(Annotation ann) {\n        return ann.getName();\n    }\n}\n// In the _add method:\nAnnotation previous = _annotations.put(new CustomKeyResolver().resolveKey(ann), ann);`"
