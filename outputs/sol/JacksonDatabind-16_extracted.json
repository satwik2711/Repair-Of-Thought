    "The root cause of this bug is that the `_add` method in the buggy function is using the `annotationType()` method to determine the key for the annotation in the `_annotations` map. However, this method returns the type of the annotation, not the name of the property that the annotation is intended to represent. As a result, when the mixin is applied, the wrong property name is being used in the serialized JSON.": [
      "Use a Custom Annotation Key\nUse a custom annotation key that is specific to the mixin, rather than relying on the `annotationType()` method. This would involve adding a new field to the annotation that specifies the property name, and then using that field as the key in the `_annotations` map. For example, the annotation could be modified to include a `propertyName` field, and then the `_add` method could be modified to use that field as the key.",
      "Use a Property Name Resolver\nCreate a property name resolver that can determine the correct property name based on the annotation type and the mixin. This would involve creating a new class that implements a resolver interface, and then using that resolver to determine the property name in the `_add` method. For example, the resolver could use a mapping of annotation types to property names, and then use that mapping to determine the correct property name.",
      "Modify the Annotation Type to Include a Property Name Field\nModify the annotation type to include a `propertyName` field that specifies the correct property name. This would involve changing the annotation definition to include this new field, and then using that field as the key in the `_annotations` map. For example, the annotation could be modified to include a `propertyName` field, and then the `_add` method could be modified to use that field as the key."
