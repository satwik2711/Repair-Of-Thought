This can be done by checking if the result of the subtraction `boundaries[1][i] - boundaries[0][i]` is greater than `Double.MAX_VALUE`. If it is, throw a `NumberIsTooLargeException`.

For example, we could use the `Math.log()` function to normalize the variables, which would avoid the overflow issue. This can be implemented by replacing the subtraction with a logarithmic normalization:\n```java\ndouble normalizedValue = Math.log(boundaries[1][i] / boundaries[0][i]);\n```\nThis fix is more complex, but it provides a more robust solution that can handle a wider range of boundary values.\n\nSuggestion 3: Increase the Precision of the Normalization\nIncrease the precision of the normalization by using a higher-precision data type, such as `BigDecimal`.
