We can add a conditional statement to check if bitsCachedSize is greater than or equal to 57, and if so, handle it separately to avoid overflow. This can be achieved by resetting bitsCachedSize to 0 and bitsCached to 0 when overflow is detected.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Larger Data Type for bitsCachedSize\nAnother possible solution is to use a larger data type for bitsCachedSize, such as a long instead of an int. This would provide more room for the value to grow without overflowing. However, this solution may require additional changes to the code to accommodate the larger data type.\n\nSuggestion 3: Handle bitsCachedSize Overflow Explicitly with Bitwise Operations\nA third possible solution is to handle the overflow of bitsCachedSize explicitly using bitwise operations. We can use bitwise AND operation to mask the bits that would cause overflow and then perform the left shift operation. This solution would require careful consideration of the bitwise operations to ensure that the correct result is obtained.",
