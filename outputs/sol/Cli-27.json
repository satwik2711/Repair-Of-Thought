The function `setSelected(Option option)` is supposed to set the selected option of an `OptionGroup` to the given `option`. It throws an `AlreadySelectedException` if an option from this group has already been selected. The trigger test `testOptionGroupLong()` creates an `OptionGroup`, adds two options to it, and then parses a command line with the option `--bar`. The test expects the selected option to be `bar`, but the actual result is `null`, causing a `ComparisonFailure`.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue lies in the fact that the `setSelected(Option option)` function is not being called when an option is parsed from the command line.
