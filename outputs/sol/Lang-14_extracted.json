    "The issue lies in the fact that the equals method of the CharSequence interface does not guarantee to work correctly when comparing different types of CharSequences. In this case, the equals method of the StringBuilder class is not overridden to compare its contents with other CharSequences. Therefore, when comparing a CharSequence with a StringBuilder, the equals method of the StringBuilder class is called, which does not compare the contents correctly.": [
      "Implementing Custom Equals Method\nWe can implement a custom equals method that compares the contents of the two CharSequences. This method can be used instead of the equals method of the CharSequence interface. Here's an example implementation:\n```java\npublic static boolean equals(CharSequence cs1, CharSequence cs2) {\n    if (cs1 == cs2) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (cs1 == null || cs2 == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    int length = cs1.length();\n    if (length != cs2.length()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        if (cs1.charAt(i) != cs2.charAt(i)) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n```\nThis implementation first checks if the two CharSequences are the same object, and if so, returns true. Then it checks if either of the CharSequences is null, and if so, returns false. After that, it checks if the lengths of the two CharSequences are equal, and if not, returns false. Finally, it compares the characters of the two CharSequences one by one, and if it finds any mismatch, returns false. If all checks pass, it returns true.",
      "Using toString Method\nAnother approach is to convert both CharSequences to strings and then compare the strings. This approach is simpler but may be less efficient than the custom equals method. Here's an example implementation:\n```java\npublic static boolean equals(CharSequence cs1, CharSequence cs2) {\n    if (cs1 == cs2) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (cs1 == null || cs2 == null) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return cs1.toString().equals(cs2.toString());\n}\n```\nThis implementation first checks if the two CharSequences are the same object, and if so, returns true. Then it checks if either of the CharSequences is null, and if so, returns false. After that, it converts both CharSequences to strings using the toString method and compares the strings using the equals method.",
      "Using Apache Commons Lang's EqualsBuilder\nApache Commons Lang provides an EqualsBuilder class that can be used to compare objects. We can use this class to compare the CharSequences. Here's an example implementation:\n```java\npublic static boolean equals(CharSequence cs1, CharSequence cs2) {\n    return new EqualsBuilder().append(cs1, cs2).isEquals();\n}\n```\nThis implementation uses the EqualsBuilder class to compare the CharSequences. The append method is used to add the CharSequences to the builder, and the isEquals method is used to check if the objects are equal."
