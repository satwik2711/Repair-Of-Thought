    "The root cause of the bug is in the `matchConstraint` function, which is responsible for inferring the types of properties on an object based on a constraint object. The function is not correctly handling the case where a property is not explicitly declared on the object, but is present in the constraint object. In this case, the function is inferring the type of the `text` property as `string|undefined`, which is not the expected type.": [
      "Use the Constraint Object's Property Type\nThe `matchConstraint` function should use the property type from the constraint object when inferring the type of a property on the object. This can be done by modifying the `matchConstraint` function to use the `constraintObj.getPropertyType(prop)` method to get the property type from the constraint object, rather than inferring it based on the object's properties. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic void matchConstraint(ObjectType constraintObj) {\n  // ...\n  JSType propType = constraintObj.getPropertyType(prop);\n  defineInferredProperty(prop, propType, null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis suggestion ensures that the type of the `text` property is correctly inferred as `string`, which matches the expected type.",
      "Check for Explicit Property Declarations\nThe `matchConstraint` function should check if a property is explicitly declared on the object before inferring its type. This can be done by adding a check for `isPropertyTypeDeclared(prop)` before inferring the type of the property. If the property is explicitly declared, we can use its declared type instead of inferring it. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic void matchConstraint(ObjectType constraintObj) {\n  // ...\n  if (isPropertyTypeDeclared(prop)) {\n    JSType propType = getDeclaredPropertyType(prop);\n    defineInferredProperty(prop, propType, null);\n  } else {\n    // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis suggestion ensures that the type of the `text` property is correctly inferred as `string`, which matches the expected type.",
      "Use the Object's Native Type with Constraint Object's Property Type\nThe `matchConstraint` function should use the object's native type when inferring the type of a property, and also consider the property type from the constraint object. This can be done by modifying the `matchConstraint` function to use the `getNativeType(JSTypeNative.VOID_TYPE)` method to get the object's native type, and then using that type to infer the type of the property. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic void matchConstraint(ObjectType constraintObj) {\n  // ...\n  JSType nativeType = getNativeType(JSTypeNative.VOID_TYPE);\n  JSType propType = nativeType.getLeastSupertype(constraintObj.getPropertyType(prop));\n  defineInferredProperty(prop, propType, null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis suggestion ensures that the type of the `text` property is correctly inferred as `string`, which matches the expected type."
