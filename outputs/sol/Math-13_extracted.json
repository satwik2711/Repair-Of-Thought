    "The `OutOfMemoryError` is likely caused by the large size of the input matrix in the `testLargeSample` test. The `EigenDecomposition` class is trying to create a new `DiagonalMatrix` instance, which requires a significant amount of memory. The `testLargeSample` test is creating a large number of observed points (40,000) and fitting a polynomial of degree up to 10, which results in a large weight matrix being passed to the `squareRoot` function.": [
      "Reduce Matrix Size\nOne possible solution is to reduce the size of the input matrix by using a smaller number of observed points or a lower degree polynomial. This would reduce the memory usage of the `EigenDecomposition` class and prevent the `OutOfMemoryError`. However, this might affect the accuracy of the polynomial fit.",
      "Use a More Efficient Decomposition Algorithm\nAnother possible solution is to use a more efficient decomposition algorithm that requires less memory. For example, we could use the `CholeskyDecomposition` class instead of `EigenDecomposition`. This would require modifying the `squareRoot` function to use the `CholeskyDecomposition` class. Here's an example of how the modified `squareRoot` function could look like:\n```java\nprivate RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {\n    final CholeskyDecomposition dec = new CholeskyDecomposition(m);\n    return dec.getL();\n}\n```",
      "Increase Heap Size\nA third possible solution is to increase the heap size of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to allow for larger matrices to be processed. This would require modifying the JVM settings and might not be feasible in all environments. For example, you could add the following option to the JVM command line:\n```bash\n-Xmx1024m\n```\nThis would increase the heap size to 1024 MB. However, this solution might not be feasible in all environments, and it's generally better to optimize the code instead of relying on increased heap size."
