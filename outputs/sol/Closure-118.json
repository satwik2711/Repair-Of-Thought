The function `handleObjectLit` is designed to process an OBJECTLIT node in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the JavaScript code.

This can be done by adding a simple check before the `scheduleRenaming` call. If the property is already present, the function can skip the renaming step. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (!propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n    if (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child, processProperty(t, prop, type, null))) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that properties that are already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map are not renamed, which should fix the bug.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Different Renaming Strategy\nAnother possible fix is to use a different renaming strategy that does not rely on the `propertiesToErrorFor` map. For example, the function could use a unique identifier for each property, or use a different naming convention that does not conflict with existing properties. One possible implementation could be to use a UUID generator to generate a unique name for each property:\n```java\nString uniqueName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\nif (!prop.scheduleRenaming(child, processProperty(t, prop, type, uniqueName))) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that each property has a unique name, which should fix the bug.\n\nSuggestion 3: Modify the `scheduleRenaming` Function\nA third possible fix is to modify the `scheduleRenaming` function to handle the case where the property name is already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map. This could involve adding a new parameter to the function that indicates whether the property name should be renamed or not. For example:\n```java\nboolean scheduleRenaming(Node child, Property prop, T type, String name, boolean rename) {\n    if (rename && propertiesToErrorFor.containsKey(name)) {\n        // do not rename the property\n        return true;\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis fix ensures that the `scheduleRenaming` function handles the case where the property name is already present in the `propertiesToErrorFor` map, which should fix the bug.",
