    "The issue arises from the way the flatten method handles options with an equal sign. When an option has an equal sign, the current implementation checks if the option exists, but it does not properly split the option from its value. In the case of the test '-f=bar', the code checks if 'f' is an option and then adds '-f' and '=bar' to the tokens list separately. However, it does not correctly handle the equal sign as part of the option syntax, resulting in the value being incorrectly parsed as '=bar' instead of just 'bar'.\\n\\n": [
      "Handle Options with Equal Signs\\nThe flatten method should be modified to check if an option has an equal sign. If it does, the method should split the option from its value correctly. This can be achieved by checking for the presence of an equal sign in the option and then using the split method to separate the option from its value. For example, if the option is '-f=bar', the method should add '-f' to the tokens list and 'bar' as its value.\\n\\n",
      "Modify the Option Parsing Logic\\nAnother approach is to modify the option parsing logic to handle options with equal signs. This can be done by adding a special case to handle options with an equal sign, where the option and its value are split correctly before being added to the tokens list. This approach requires modifying the existing option parsing logic to handle the special case of options with equal signs.\\n\\n",
      "Introduce a New Method to Handle Options with Equal Signs\\nA new method can be introduced to specifically handle options with equal signs. This method can be responsible for correctly splitting the option from its value and then adding them to the tokens list. This approach would keep the main flatten method simple and easy to understand, while still handling the special case of options with equal signs. The new method can be called from the flatten method when an option with an equal sign is encountered.\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"}"
