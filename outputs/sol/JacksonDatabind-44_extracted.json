    "The root cause of the bug is that the _narrow function is not correctly checking if the subclass is a subtype of the current class. This is causing the deserialization process to fail when trying to deserialize a field that is not present in the current class. The TODO comment in the code suggests that this issue was known but not fixed in version 2.8.": [
      "Implement Subclass Relationship Check\nWe can implement a subclass relationship check in the _narrow function to ensure that the subclass is a subtype of the current class. This can be done by using the isAssignableFrom method in Java. If the subclass is not a subtype of the current class, we can throw an IllegalArgumentException. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass) {\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    if (!_class.isAssignableFrom(subclass)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \" + subclass.getName() + \" not sub-type of \" + _class.getName());\n    }\n    return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces, _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Type Checking Mechanism\nWe can use a more robust type checking mechanism, such as the TypeFactory.findTypeParameters method, to check if the subclass is a subtype of the current class. This method can handle more complex type relationships and can provide more accurate results. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\nprotected JavaType _narrow(Class<?> subclass) {\n    if (_class == subclass) {\n        return this;\n    }\n    TypeFactory tf = TypeFactory.defaultInstance();\n    JavaType type = tf.constructType(_class);\n    if (!type.isTypeOrSubTypeOf(subclass)) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Class \" + subclass.getName() + \" not sub-type of \" + _class.getName());\n    }\n    return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, this, _superInterfaces, _valueHandler, _typeHandler, _asStatic);\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Deserialization Process to Ignore Unknown Fields\nWe can modify the deserialization process to ignore unknown fields instead of throwing an exception. This can be done by setting the ignoreUnknownProperties property to true in the ObjectMapper. However, this may not be the best solution as it can lead to data loss during deserialization. The modified code would look like this:\n\n```java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\nmapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false);\n```"
