    "The root cause of the bug is that the `traverseNew` function does not correctly handle the case where the constructor type is a `NoObjectType` that implements the `FunctionType` interface. In this case, the `toMaybeFunctionType` method returns `null`, but the `constructorType` is still a valid function type. As a result, the `getInstanceType` method is not called, and the type of the scope is not updated correctly.": [
      "Directly Cast to FunctionType\nOne possible fix is to directly cast the `constructorType` to `FunctionType` without calling the `toMaybeFunctionType` method. This is because we know that the `constructorType` is a valid function type, even if it is a `NoObjectType`. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nFunctionType ct = (FunctionType) constructorType;\nif (ct.isConstructor()) {\n  type = ct.getInstanceType();\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and straightforward, but it assumes that the `constructorType` is always a valid function type.",
      "Check for NoObjectType\nAnother possible fix is to explicitly check if the `constructorType` is a `NoObjectType` and handle it accordingly. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (constructorType instanceof NoObjectType) {\n  FunctionType ct = (FunctionType) constructorType;\n  type = ct.getInstanceType();\n} else {\n  FunctionType ct = constructorType.toMaybeFunctionType();\n  if (ct != null && ct.isConstructor()) {\n    type = ct.getInstanceType();\n  }\n}\n```\nThis fix is more robust than the first one, as it handles the case where the `constructorType` is not a `NoObjectType`.",
      "Use a More Robust Type Checking Method\nA more robust fix would be to use a more robust type checking method that can handle the case where the `constructorType` is a `NoObjectType`. For example, we can use the `isSubtypeOf` method to check if the `constructorType` is a subtype of `FunctionType`. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (constructorType.isSubtypeOf(FunctionType.class)) {\n  FunctionType ct = (FunctionType) constructorType;\n  type = ct.getInstanceType();\n}\n```\nThis fix is the most robust of the three, as it can handle any type that is a subtype of `FunctionType`, not just `NoObjectType`."
