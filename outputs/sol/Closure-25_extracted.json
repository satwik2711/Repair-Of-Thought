    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `traverseNew` is not correctly handling the type inference of the new expression. Specifically, the function is not correctly propagating the type of the constructor function's parameter to the type of the new expression. This is because the function is not correctly handling the case where the constructor function's parameter has a type annotation with a property type.": [
      "Propagate Constructor Parameter Type\nPropagate the type of the constructor function's parameter to the type of the new expression. This can be done by adding a new line of code to the `traverseNew` function to set the type of the new expression to the type of the constructor function's parameter. This solution is the most straightforward and efficient way to fix the bug.\n\n```java\nprivate FlowScope traverseNew(Node n, FlowScope scope) {\n  ...\n  JSType constructorParamType = constructorType.getParameterType(0);\n  if (constructorParamType != null) {\n    type = constructorParamType;\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```",
      "Handle Property Types Correctly\nHandle property types correctly in the `traverseNew` function. This can be done by adding a new line of code to the `traverseNew` function to handle the case where the constructor function's parameter has a type annotation with a property type. This solution requires more complex logic to handle property types correctly.\n\n```java\nprivate FlowScope traverseNew(Node n, FlowScope scope) {\n  ...\n  if (constructorType instanceof RecordType) {\n    RecordType recordType = (RecordType) constructorType;\n    type = recordType.getPropertyType(\"foo\");\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Type Inference Algorithm\nUse a more robust type inference algorithm in the `traverseNew` function. This can be done by replacing the existing type inference algorithm with a more robust one that can handle complex type annotations. This solution requires significant changes to the existing code and may have performance implications.\n\n```java\nprivate FlowScope traverseNew(Node n, FlowScope scope) {\n  ...\n  type = inferType(constructorType, n);\n  ...\n}\n\nprivate JSType inferType(JSType constructorType, Node n) {\n  // Implement a more robust type inference algorithm here\n}\n```"
