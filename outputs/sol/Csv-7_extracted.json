    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `initializeHeader` does not handle duplicate header entries correctly. When there are duplicate header entries, the function will overwrite the previous index mapping with the new one, which can lead to incorrect results. The function should throw an `IllegalStateException` when it encounters duplicate header entries, but it's not doing so.": [
      "Check for Duplicate Header Entries Before Adding to Map\nWe can add a check before adding a header entry to the map to see if it already exists. If it does, we can throw an `IllegalStateException`. This will ensure that we don't overwrite previous index mappings. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (header != null) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < header.length; i++) {\n        if (hdrMap.containsKey(header[i])) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Duplicate header entry: \" + header[i]);\n        }\n        hdrMap.put(header[i], Integer.valueOf(i));\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Use a Set to Keep Track of Unique Header Entries\nWe can use a `Set` to keep track of unique header entries. Before adding a header entry to the map, we can check if it already exists in the set. If it does, we can throw an `IllegalStateException`. This will ensure that we don't overwrite previous index mappings. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nSet<String> uniqueHeaders = new HashSet<>();\nif (header != null) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < header.length; i++) {\n        if (!uniqueHeaders.add(header[i])) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Duplicate header entry: \" + header[i]);\n        }\n        hdrMap.put(header[i], Integer.valueOf(i));\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Throw an Exception When a Duplicate Header Entry is Encountered\nWe can throw an exception when a duplicate header entry is encountered. This will ensure that the function fails fast and doesn't produce incorrect results. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nif (header != null) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < header.length; i++) {\n        if (hdrMap.containsKey(header[i])) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Duplicate header entry: \" + header[i]);\n        }\n        hdrMap.put(header[i], Integer.valueOf(i));\n    }\n}\n```"
