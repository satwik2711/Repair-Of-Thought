    "The root cause of the bug is that the Validate.notEmpty(name) call in the constructor does not allow for an empty string as a valid value for the name parameter. However, the test case constructorValidationOkWithBlankName expects an empty string to be a valid value for the name parameter.": [
      "Allow Empty Strings for Name Parameter\nThe Validate.notEmpty(name) call could be removed or modified to allow for empty strings as a valid value for the name parameter. This would allow the test case constructorValidationOkWithBlankName to pass. However, this approach may not be desirable if an empty string is not a valid value for the name parameter in the context of the application.",
      "Update Test Case to Use Non-Empty String\nThe test case constructorValidationOkWithBlankName could be updated to use a non-empty string for the name parameter. This would allow the test case to pass without modifying the constructor. This approach is simple and straightforward, but it may not be desirable if the test case is intended to test the behavior of the constructor with an empty string.",
      "Add Additional Validation for Name Parameter\nAdditional validation could be added to the constructor to check if the name parameter is empty, and if so, set a default value or throw a custom exception. This would provide more flexibility and control over the validation process. For example, the constructor could be modified as follows:\n```java\npublic DocumentType(String name, String publicId, String systemId, String baseUri) {\n    super(baseUri);\n\n    if (name == null || name.isEmpty()) {\n        name = \"DEFAULT\"; // or throw a custom exception\n    }\n    attr(\"name\", name);\n    attr(\"publicId\", publicId);\n    attr(\"systemId\", systemId);\n}\n```\nThis approach allows for more control over the validation process and provides a way to handle empty strings in a more flexible way."
