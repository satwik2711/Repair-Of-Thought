    "The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of try-finally blocks and return statements in the computeFollowNode function. Specifically, when a return statement is encountered inside a try block, the function does not correctly handle the finally block and the return statement. This leads to an unexpected error during compilation.": [
      "Correctly Handle Return Statements Inside Try Blocks\nTo fix this bug, we need to add a special case to handle return statements inside try blocks. When a return statement is encountered, the function should check if it is inside a try block and if so, it should correctly handle the finally block and the return statement. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the current node is a return statement and if its parent is a try block. If both conditions are true, the function should handle the finally block and the return statement accordingly.",
      "Modify the Control Flow Analysis to Handle Try-Finally Blocks\nAnother potential fix is to modify the control flow analysis to handle try-finally blocks correctly. This can be achieved by adding a new case to the switch statement to handle try blocks. When a try block is encountered, the function should analyze the control flow inside the try block and handle the finally block accordingly. This can be done by recursively calling the computeFollowNode function on the try block's children.",
      "Add a Special Case to Handle Return Statements in Try Blocks with Finally Blocks\nA third potential fix is to add a special case to handle return statements in try blocks with finally blocks. When a return statement is encountered inside a try block with a finally block, the function should handle the finally block and the return statement accordingly. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the current node is a return statement and if its parent is a try block with a finally block. If both conditions are true, the function should handle the finally block and the return statement accordingly."
