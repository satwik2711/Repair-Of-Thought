    "The root cause of the bug is that the `ensureCapacity` method is not correctly handling the case when the `width` parameter is less than the length of the string to be appended. In this case, the `ensureCapacity` method is not increasing the capacity of the `buffer` array enough to accommodate the entire string, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to write to the `buffer` array. This is because the `size` variable is being incremented by the `width` parameter, which is less than the length of the string, causing the indexing to go out of bounds.": [
      "Increase Capacity Based on String Length\nIncrease the capacity of the `buffer` array based on the length of the string to be appended, rather than the `width` parameter. This can be done by changing the `ensureCapacity` call to `ensureCapacity(size + strLen)`.",
      "Truncate String to Width\nTruncate the string to be appended to the `width` parameter, rather than trying to append the entire string. This can be done by changing the `str.getChars` call to `str.getChars(0, Math.min(strLen, width), buffer, size)`.",
      "Adjust Size Increment\nAdjust the increment of the `size` variable to be the length of the string to be appended, rather than the `width` parameter. This can be done by changing the `size += width` line to `size += strLen`.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
