    "The root cause of this bug is that the function does not validate the start and end values properly. When the start and end values are the same, the function does not throw an exception, but instead tries to generate a random string, which leads to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The function also does not check if the start value is greater than the end value, which can also lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Additionally, the function does not provide a meaningful error message when the start and end values are invalid.": [
      "Validate Start and End Values\nAdd a check at the beginning of the function to validate the start and end values. If the start value is greater than the end value, or if the gap between the start and end values is not positive, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a meaningful error message.\n\n```java\nif (start > end) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Start value (\" + start + \") must be less than or equal to end value (\" + end + \").\");\n}\n```",
      "Provide Meaningful Error Message\nModify the error message to include the start and end values, and to indicate that the start value must be less than or equal to the end value.\n\n```java\nif (gap <= 0) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Gap between start value (\" + start + \") and end value (\" + end + \") must be positive.\");\n}\n```",
      "Handle Edge Cases\nAdd checks to handle edge cases, such as when the start and end values are equal, or when the gap between the start and end values is zero. In these cases, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a meaningful error message.\n\n```java\nif (start == end) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Start value (\" + start + \") and end value (\" + end + \") cannot be equal.\");\n}\n```"
