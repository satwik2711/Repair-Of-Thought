    "The root cause of the bug is that the `get` function does not check if the index obtained from the `mapping` is within the bounds of the `values` array. This can lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the index is greater than or equal to the length of the `values` array.": [
      "Add Bounds Checking\nAdd a simple bounds check to ensure that the index is within the range of the `values` array. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the `values` array. If it is, throw an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of attempting to retrieve the value.",
      "Validate Mapping\nValidate the `mapping` to ensure that it does not contain any indices that are out of bounds. This can be done by iterating over the `mapping` and checking if any of the indices are greater than or equal to the length of the `values` array. If any are found, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.",
      "Use Defensive Programming\nUse defensive programming techniques to handle the case where the index is out of bounds. Instead of throwing an exception, return a default value or a special value to indicate that the index is out of bounds. This approach can be useful if the `get` function is expected to handle out-of-bounds indices in a specific way.\n\nCorrected Code:\n```java\npublic String get(final String name) {\n    if (mapping == null) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\n                \"No header mapping was specified, the record values can't be accessed by name\");\n    }\n    final Integer index = mapping.get(name);\n    if (index != null && index.intValue() >= values.length) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Inconsistent record\");\n    }\n    return index != null ? values[index.intValue()] : null;\n}\n```"
