    "The root cause of the bug is that the `validateSubType` function is not correctly identifying the `ComboPooledDataSource` class as an illegal type. This is because the function is only checking if the class name starts with the `PREFIX_SPRING` prefix, but the `ComboPooledDataSource` class is in a different package and does not match this prefix. Additionally, the function is not correctly handling the case where the class is not a Spring framework type but still needs to be blocked.": [
      "Add ComboPooledDataSource to _cfgIllegalClassNames\nOne possible fix is to add the `ComboPooledDataSource` class to the `_cfgIllegalClassNames` set. This would ensure that the class is correctly identified as an illegal type and would prevent it from being deserialized. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic void validateSubType(DeserializationContext ctxt, JavaType type) throws JsonMappingException\n{\n    ...\n    _cfgIllegalClassNames.add(\"com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource\");\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is straightforward and directly addresses the issue, but it may not be the most scalable solution if there are many other classes that need to be blocked.",
      "Modify Spring Framework Type Handling\nAnother possible fix is to modify the Spring framework type handling to correctly identify the `ComboPooledDataSource` class. This could involve adding additional checks for the class name or package, or modifying the existing checks to be more inclusive. For example:\n```java\nif (full.startsWith(PREFIX_SPRING) || full.startsWith(\"com.mchange.v2.c3p0\")) {\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis solution would allow the function to correctly identify the `ComboPooledDataSource` class as a Spring framework type, but it may not be the most efficient solution if there are many other classes that need to be handled.",
      "Add Additional Checks for Blocked Classes\nA third possible fix is to add additional checks for blocked classes that are not Spring framework types. This could involve adding a separate set of blocked classes or modifying the existing checks to include additional classes. For example:\n```java\nSet<String> blockedClasses = new HashSet<>();\nblockedClasses.add(\"com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource\");\n...\nif (_cfgIllegalClassNames.contains(full) || blockedClasses.contains(full)) {\n    ...\n}\n```\nThis solution would allow the function to correctly identify the `ComboPooledDataSource` class as a blocked class, and would also provide a way to add additional blocked classes in the future."
