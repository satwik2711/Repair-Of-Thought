Then analyse the root cause and finally try to provide a repair suggestions to fix the buggy.\nNote that the bug can be fixed by modifying only the given buggy code; do not attempt to modify the class, add new functions, or conduct further testing.\n\n1. Buggy Function: \n/**\n* Normalizes this period using standard rules, assuming a 12 month year,\n* 7 day week, 24 hour day, 60 minute hour and 60 second minute,\n* providing control over how the result is split into fields.\n* <p>\n* This method allows you to normalize a period.\n* However to achieve this it makes the assumption that all years are\n* 12 months, all weeks are 7 days, all days are 24 hours,\n* all hours are 60 minutes and all minutes are 60 seconds. This is not\n* true when daylight savings time is considered, and may also not be true\n* for some chronologies. However, it is included as it is a useful operation\n* for many applications and business rules.\n* <p>\n* If the period contains years or months, then the months will be\n* normalized to be between 0 and 11. The days field and below will be\n* normalized as necessary, however this will not overflow into the months\n* field. Thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months.\n* But a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days.\n* <p>\n* The PeriodType parameter controls how the result is created. It allows\n* you to omit certain fields from the result if desired. For example,\n* you may not want the result to include weeks, in which case you pass\n* in <code>PeriodType.yearMonthDayTime()</code>.\n*\n* @param type  the period type of the new period, null means standard type\n* @return a normalized period equivalent to this period\n* @throws ArithmeticException if any field is too large to be represented\n* @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this period contains non-zero\n*  years or months but the specified period type does not support them\n* @since 1.5\n*/\npublic Period normalizedStandard(PeriodType type) {\n    type = DateTimeUtils.getPeriodType(type);\n    long millis = getMillis();  // no overflow can happen, even with Integer.MAX_VALUEs\n    millis += (((long) getSeconds()) * ((long) DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_SECOND));\n    millis += (((long) getMinutes()) * ((long) DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_MINUTE));\n    millis += (((long) getHours()) * ((long) DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_HOUR));\n    millis += (((long) getDays()) * ((long) DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_DAY));\n    millis += (((long) getWeeks()) * ((long) DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_WEEK));\n    Period result = new Period(millis, type, ISOChronology.getInstanceUTC());\n    int years = getYears();\n    int months = getMonths();\n    if (years != 0 || months != 0) {\n        years = FieldUtils.safeAdd(years, months / 12);\n        months = months % 12;\n        if (years != 0) {\n            result = result.withYears(years);\n        }\n        if (months != 0) {\n            result = result.withMonths(months);\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\n2.
