    "The issue lies in the createCopy() method. When creating a copy of the TimeSeries, it correctly checks the start and end indices and clones the data points. However, the problem arises when it adds the cloned data points to the new TimeSeries copy. The add() method likely adds the data points in the order they are received, without considering the index. As a result, when creating a copy, it adds the data points at the end of the new TimeSeries, instead of maintaining their original indices. This indicates that the createCopy() method is not properly handling the indices when adding the cloned data points to the new TimeSeries copy.": [
      "Use add(int index, TimeSeriesDataItem item) Method\nUse the add(int index, TimeSeriesDataItem item) method instead of the add(TimeSeriesDataItem item) method to specify the index at which the data point should be added. This will ensure that the data points are added at the correct indices, relative to the start of the copy. However, since we are creating a copy from start to end, we should adjust the index to be relative to the start of the copy, not the original TimeSeries.",
      "Create a New ArrayList and Add to It\nCreate a new ArrayList with the correct size (end - start + 1) and then add the cloned data points to the ArrayList at the correct indices. After that, assign this new ArrayList to the data field of the copy. This will ensure that the data points are added at the correct indices and that the ArrayList has the correct size.",
      "Adjust Index When Adding to Copy\nAdjust the index when adding the cloned data points to the new TimeSeries copy, so that they are added at the correct positions. Since we are creating a copy from start to end, we can simply add the cloned data points to the copy in the order they are received, without needing to adjust their indices. However, we should ensure that the copy's data field is initialized with the correct size, or that we are using a method that allows us to add elements at specific indices."
