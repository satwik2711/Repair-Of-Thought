    "The issue is not directly related to the `isSimpleNumber` function, but rather to how the `CodePrinter` handles numeric keys in objects. The `isSimpleNumber` function is used to determine whether a key should be printed as a number or a string. However, the function is not the root cause of the issue. The root cause is likely in the `CodePrinter` class, which is not shown in the provided code. The `CodePrinter` class is printing numeric keys as strings, resulting in the unexpected output.": [
      "Modify `isSimpleNumber` to always return true for numeric keys\nThis solution involves modifying the `isSimpleNumber` function to always return true for numeric keys, so that they are printed as numbers. This can be achieved by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:\n```java\nstatic boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {\n  if (s.matches(\"\\\\d+\")) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  int len = s.length();\n  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {\n    char c = s.charAt(index);\n    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return len > 0 && s.charAt(0) != '0';\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple but might have unintended consequences. It would fix the issue but might cause issues with non-numeric keys that are printed as numbers.",
      "Modify `isSimpleNumber` to check if the string is a valid JavaScript property name\nThis solution involves modifying the `isSimpleNumber` function to check if the string is a valid JavaScript property name. This can be achieved by using a regular expression to match valid property names:\n```java\nstatic boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {\n  if (s.matches(\"[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z_$0-9]*\")) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  int len = s.length();\n  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {\n    char c = s.charAt(index);\n    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n  return len > 0 && s.charAt(0) != '0';\n}\n```\nThis solution is more robust but might be more complex to implement. It would handle edge cases correctly but might require additional checks and balances.",
