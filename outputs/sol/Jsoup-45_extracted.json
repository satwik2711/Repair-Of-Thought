    "The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the 'th' element in the resetInsertionMode function. The function is not correctly transitioning to the InCell state when encountering a 'th' element, leading to incorrect parsing of the HTML structure.": [
      "Add 'th' to the InCell Transition\nWe can add 'th' to the list of elements that transition to the InCell state. This will ensure that the parser correctly handles 'th' elements and resets the insertion mode accordingly. The corrected code will be:\n```java\nelse if ((\"td\".equals(name) || \"th\".equals(name)) && !last) {\n    transition(HtmlTreeBuilderState.InCell);\n    break;\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, and it fixes the bug without introducing any new issues.",
      "Remove Duplicate 'td' Check and Add 'th' Check\nThe current implementation has a duplicate check for 'td' elements. We can remove this duplicate check and add a single check for both 'td' and 'th' elements. This will simplify the code and fix the bug. The corrected code will be:\n```java\nelse if ((\"td\".equals(name) || \"th\".equals(name)) && !last) {\n    transition(HtmlTreeBuilderState.InCell);\n    break;\n}\n```\nThis solution is similar to Suggestion 1, but it also removes the duplicate 'td' check, making the code more efficient.",
      "Reorder the Transition Checks to Prioritize 'th' Element\nWe can reorder the transition checks to prioritize the 'th' element. This will ensure that the parser correctly handles 'th' elements and resets the insertion mode accordingly. The corrected code will be:\n```java\nelse if (\"th\".equals(name) && !last) {\n    transition(HtmlTreeBuilderState.InCell);\n    break;\n} else if (\"td\".equals(name) && !last) {\n    transition(HtmlTreeBuilderState.InCell);\n    break;\n}\n```\nThis solution is more complex than the previous two, but it ensures that the 'th' element is handled correctly, even if it appears before the 'td' element in the HTML structure."
