    "The `setName` function is not properly handling the backslash character in the entry name. In Java, the backslash is an escape character, and it needs to be properly escaped when used in a string. However, in this case, the backslash is being treated as a literal character, which is causing the entry name to be incorrectly set.": [
      "Escape the Backslash Character\nThe `setName` function can be modified to escape the backslash character in the entry name. This can be done by replacing the backslash with a double backslash (`\\\\\\\\`) before setting the entry name. This will ensure that the backslash is properly handled and the entry name is set correctly.\n\n```java\nprotected void setName(String name) {\n    this.name = name.replace(\"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\");\n}\n```",
      "Use a Regular Expression to Validate the Entry Name\nThe `setName` function can be modified to use a regular expression to validate the entry name. This can help ensure that the entry name does not contain any invalid characters, including the backslash. The regular expression can be used to match the entry name against a pattern that allows only valid characters.\n\n```java\nprotected void setName(String name) {\n    if (!name.matches(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$\")) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid entry name\");\n    }\n    this.name = name;\n}\n```",
      "Use the `java.nio.file.Path` Class to Handle the Entry Name\nThe `setName` function can be modified to use the `java.nio.file.Path` class to handle the entry name. This class provides a more robust way of handling file paths and can properly handle the backslash character. The `Path` class can be used to normalize the entry name and ensure that it is in a consistent format.\n\n```java\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\nprotected void setName(String name) {\n    Path path = Paths.get(name);\n    this.name = path.normalize().toString();\n}\n```"
