    "The root cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case where the input buffer has a length of 12 or more, which can cause an overflow when parsing the octal string. The function checks if the length is less than 2, but it does not check for lengths greater than 11, which can lead to incorrect parsing and an `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown.": [
      "Add Length Check\nAdd a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the length is not greater than 11. If the length is greater than 11, throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the length is too long. This can be achieved by adding the following code at the beginning of the function:\n```java\nif (length > 11) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Length \" + length + \" is too long. Maximum allowed length is 11.\");\n}\n```\nThis approach is simple and effective, and it does not require modifying the parsing logic or returning a different type.",
      "Modify Parsing Logic\nModify the parsing logic to correctly handle lengths greater than 11. One possible approach is to use a `BigInteger` to store the parsed value, which can handle larger values than a `long`. This would require modifying the function to return a `BigInteger` instead of a `long`. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static BigInteger parseOctal(final byte[] buffer, final int offset, final int length) {\n    BigInteger result = BigInteger.ZERO;\n    // ... rest of the function remains the same ...\n    return result;\n}\n```\nThis approach requires modifying the function signature and the parsing logic, but it provides a more robust solution that can handle larger input buffers.",
      "Truncate Input Buffer\nTruncate the input buffer to a length of 11 before parsing the octal string. This would prevent the overflow issue, but it may not be the desired behavior in all cases. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\npublic static long parseOctal(final byte[] buffer, final int offset, final int length) {\n    if (length > 11) {\n        byte[] truncatedBuffer = new byte[11];\n        System.arraycopy(buffer, offset, truncatedBuffer, 0, 11);\n        return parseOctal(truncatedBuffer, 0, 11);\n    }\n    // ... rest of the function remains the same ...\n}\n```\nThis approach is simple and effective, but it may not be suitable for all use cases, as it truncates the input buffer without warning."
