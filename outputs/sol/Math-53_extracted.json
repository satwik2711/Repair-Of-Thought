      "Check for NaN before performing addition\nCheck if the real or imaginary parts of the input complex numbers are NaN before performing the addition. If either part is NaN, return a complex number with NaN as both its real and imaginary parts. This can be achieved by adding a simple if statement to check for NaN values.",

If either part is NaN, return a complex number with NaN as both its real and imaginary parts. This approach is more explicit and clear in its intention.",

If either the real or imaginary part of the input complex number is NaN, set the corresponding part of the result to NaN.
