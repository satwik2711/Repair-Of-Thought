    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `newStringIso8859_1` is not checking for null input before attempting to create a new string. The function is directly passing the input byte array to the `String` constructor, which throws a NullPointerException when the input is null.": [
      "Check for Null Input Before Creating String\nCheck if the input byte array is null before attempting to create a new string. If the input is null, return null immediately. This is the most straightforward and efficient solution, as it aligns with the function's documentation and does not introduce any additional complexity.",
      "Use Optional Class to Handle Null Input\nUse the Optional class to handle the null input. If the input is null, return an empty Optional. Otherwise, create a new string and return it wrapped in an Optional. This solution provides a more robust way of handling null inputs, but it may introduce additional complexity and may not be suitable for all use cases.",
      "Use Null-Object Pattern to Handle Null Input\nCreate a null-object that represents an empty string. If the input is null, return the null-object instead of throwing a NullPointerException. This solution provides a way to handle null inputs without introducing additional complexity, but it may not be suitable for all use cases, as it requires the creation of a null-object."
