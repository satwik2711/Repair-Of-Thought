    "The root cause of the bug is that the `inlineAliases` function is not correctly handling the scenario where a variable is assigned the `arguments` object and then passed to a function. The function is setting the `args` variable to `null` instead of inlining it.": [
      "Add a Special Case for the `arguments` Object\nAdd a special case to the `inlineAliases` function to handle the `arguments` object. This can be done by adding a check for the `arguments` object and handling it separately. Specifically, we can add a check for `name.type == Name.Type.ARGUMENTS` and handle it as a special case. This will ensure that the `args` variable is inlined correctly.",
      "Modify the `inlineAliases` Function to Correctly Handle Variables Assigned the `arguments` Object\nModify the `inlineAliases` function to correctly handle variables that are assigned the `arguments` object. This can be done by adding a check for variables that are assigned the `arguments` object and handling them separately. Specifically, we can add a check for `name.getAssignedValue() instanceof Arguments` and handle it as a special case. This will ensure that the `args` variable is inlined correctly.",
      "Use a More Sophisticated Algorithm to Determine Which Aliases Can Be Inlined\nUse a more sophisticated algorithm to determine which aliases can be inlined. This can help to avoid the issue altogether and provide a more robust solution. Specifically, we can use a data flow analysis algorithm to determine which aliases can be inlined. This will ensure that the `args` variable is inlined correctly and will also handle other similar scenarios correctly."
