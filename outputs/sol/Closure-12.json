The function `hasExceptionHandler(Node cfgNode)` is supposed to check if a given node in the control flow graph has an exception handler. However, the current implementation always returns `false`. The trigger test `testIssue794b()` creates a function with two try-catch blocks and checks if the generated function matches the expected output.
