    "The root cause of the bug is that the 'createArchiveInputStream' function is not correctly identifying the input stream as a non-archive. This is because the function is not properly checking the signature of the input stream. Specifically, the function is not correctly handling the case where the input stream does not match any of the known archive types.": [
      "Add a Check for Non-Archive Input Streams\nWe can add a check at the beginning of the 'createArchiveInputStream' function to see if the input stream matches any of the known archive types. If it does not match any of the known types, we can immediately throw an 'ArchiveException' with a message indicating that the input stream is not a valid archive. This can be done by adding a check after reading the signature of the input stream. If the signature does not match any of the known archive types, we can throw an 'ArchiveException'.",
      "Improve the TAR Signature Check\nWe can improve the TAR signature check to make it more robust. Currently, the function is trying to create a 'TarArchiveInputStream' even when the input stream does not match the TAR signature. We can modify the function to only create a 'TarArchiveInputStream' when the input stream matches the TAR signature. This can be done by removing the try-catch block that creates a 'TarArchiveInputStream' when the input stream does not match the TAR signature.",
      "Add a Default Case for Unknown Archive Types\nWe can add a default case to the 'createArchiveInputStream' function to handle unknown archive types. When the input stream does not match any of the known archive types, we can throw an 'ArchiveException' with a message indicating that the input stream is not a valid archive. This can be done by adding a default case to the if-else statement that checks the signature of the input stream. If the signature does not match any of the known archive types, we can throw an 'ArchiveException'."
