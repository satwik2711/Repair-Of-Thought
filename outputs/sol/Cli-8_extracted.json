    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `renderWrappedText` is not correctly handling the padding of the text when wrapping it. Specifically, the function is not adding the correct number of spaces to the text when wrapping it at the specified width. This is because the function is using the `trim` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the text, which is causing the padding to be lost.": [
      "Preserve Leading Whitespace\nOne possible fix is to modify the function to preserve the leading whitespace when wrapping the text. This can be done by using the `substring` method to extract the leading whitespace from the text and then appending it to the StringBuffer. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nint leadingWhitespace = text.length() - text.trim().length();\nString padding = createPadding(nextLineTabStop);\nString wrappedText = padding + text.substring(leadingWhitespace);\n```\nThis fix would ensure that the leading whitespace is preserved when wrapping the text.",
      "Use a Different Padding Strategy\nAnother possible fix is to use a different padding strategy that does not rely on the `trim` method. For example, the function could use a loop to add the correct number of spaces to the text when wrapping it. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < nextLineTabStop; i++) {\n    sb.append(' ');\n}\n```\nThis fix would ensure that the correct number of spaces is added to the text when wrapping it.",
      "Modify the `createPadding` Method\nA third possible fix is to modify the `createPadding` method to return a string that includes the leading whitespace. This would ensure that the leading whitespace is preserved when wrapping the text. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\npublic String createPadding(int nextLineTabStop) {\n    StringBuilder padding = new StringBuilder();\n    for (int i = 0; i < nextLineTabStop; i++) {\n        padding.append(' ');\n    }\n    return padding.toString();\n}\n```\nThis fix would ensure that the leading whitespace is preserved when wrapping the text."
