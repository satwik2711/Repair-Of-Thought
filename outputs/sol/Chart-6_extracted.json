    "The root cause of the bug is that the equals method in the ShapeList class is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the method is calling the super.equals(obj) method, which is not overridden in the ShapeList class. This means that the equals method is using the default implementation of the Object class, which only checks for reference equality. However, in this case, we need to check for deep equality, i.e., whether the two objects have the same contents.": [
      "Override equals Method to Check for Deep Equality\nWe can override the equals method in the ShapeList class to check for deep equality. We can do this by iterating over the shapes in the list and checking if they are equal. If all shapes are equal, then the two lists are equal. Here is the corrected code:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (obj == this) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (!(obj instanceof ShapeList)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    ShapeList other = (ShapeList) obj;\n    if (size() != other.size()) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++) {\n        if (!getShape(i).equals(other.getShape(i))) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}",
      "Use a Custom Equality Check\nWe can also use a custom equality check to compare the shapes in the list. For example, we can use a ShapeComparator class that compares two shapes based on their properties. We can then use this comparator to compare the shapes in the list. Here is an example of how we can implement this:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (obj == this) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (!(obj instanceof ShapeList)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    ShapeList other = (ShapeList) obj;\n    ShapeComparator comparator = new ShapeComparator();\n    for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++) {\n        if (!comparator.compare(getShape(i), other.getShape(i))) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}",
      "Implement a Deep Copy of the List\nAnother approach is to implement a deep copy of the list. We can create a new list and copy all the shapes from the original list to the new list. We can then compare the new list with the deserialized list. Here is an example of how we can implement this:\n@Override\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\n    if (obj == this) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (!(obj instanceof ShapeList)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    ShapeList other = (ShapeList) obj;\n    ShapeList copy = new ShapeList();\n    for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++) {\n        copy.add(getShape(i));\n    }\n    return copy.equals(other);\n}"
