    "The root cause of the issue is the incorrect implementation of the `equals` method in the `ShapeList` class. Specifically, when the object is an instance of `ShapeList`, it calls `super.equals(obj)`, which compares memory locations instead of the actual contents of the lists. This is why `l1` and `l2`, despite being serialized and deserialized versions of the same data, are not considered equal.": [
      "Implementing Content Comparison\nThe equals method should be modified to compare the contents of the ShapeList objects. This involves checking the sizes of the lists and then comparing each element. If all elements match, the lists are considered equal. This can be achieved by iterating over the elements of both lists and using their own equals methods for comparison.",
      "Handling Null and Different Class Instances\nIn addition to comparing contents, the equals method should also handle cases where the object is null or not an instance of ShapeList. It should return false for these cases, as they cannot be equal to the current ShapeList object. This ensures that the method behaves correctly for all possible input types and avoids potential NullPointerExceptions.",
      "Correctly Overriding equals Method\nThe correct implementation of the equals method should involve checking for self-comparison, instance type, and then comparing the contents. Here is a sample implementation:\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\n   if (obj == this) {\n      return true;\n   }\n   if (!(obj instanceof ShapeList)) {\n      return false;\n   }\n   ShapeList otherList = (ShapeList) obj;\n   if (this.size() != otherList.size()) {\n      return false;\n   }\n   for (int i = 0; i < this.size(); i++) {\n      if (!this.get(i).equals(otherList.get(i))) {\n         return false;\n      }\n   }\n   return true;\n}"
