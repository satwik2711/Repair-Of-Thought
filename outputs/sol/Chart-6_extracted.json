    "The root cause of the bug is that the equals function is not correctly implemented. The function is calling the super.equals(obj) method, which is not overridden in the ShapeList class. This means that the equals function is using the default implementation of the equals method, which is based on the object's reference, not its actual content. This is why the equals function is returning false when comparing the original object with the deserialized object, even though they have the same content.": [
      "Implementing equals function based on content\nWe can implement the equals function based on the content of the ShapeList objects. We can iterate over the shapes in both lists and compare them. If all shapes are equal, we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. This solution is simple and efficient, and it correctly handles edge cases.",
      "Implementing equals function based on serialization\nWe can implement the equals function based on the serialization of the ShapeList objects. We can serialize both objects and compare the serialized forms. If they are equal, we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. This solution is more complex than the first one, but it can be useful if the serialization process is already implemented.",
      "Implementing equals function based on shape comparison with null check\nWe can implement the equals function based on the comparison of the shapes in the ShapeList objects, with a null check. We can iterate over the shapes in both lists and compare them. If all shapes are equal, we can return true. If one of the shapes is null, we can return false. Otherwise, we can return false. This solution is similar to the first one, but it adds a null check to handle cases where the lists contain null shapes.\n\nHere is the corrected equals function for",
