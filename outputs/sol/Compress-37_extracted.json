    "The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the `restLen` variable, which is used to create a byte array to store the rest of the header entry. When the length of the header is not correctly calculated, it can result in a negative `restLen` value, leading to the `NegativeArraySizeException`. This can happen when the input stream contains blank lines or malformed headers.": [
      "Validate Header Length\nOne possible fix is to validate the header length before calculating the `restLen` variable. We can add a check to ensure that the length is non-negative and not too large. If the length is invalid, we can throw an exception or return an error. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:\n```java\nfinal int restLen = len - read;\nif (restLen < 0) {\n    throw new IOException(\"Invalid header length\");\n}\n```",
      "Handle Blank Lines\nAnother possible fix is to handle blank lines explicitly. We can add a check for blank lines and skip them when calculating the `restLen` variable. This will prevent the `NegativeArraySizeException` from occurring. Here's an example of how the code could be modified:\n```java\nwhile((ch = i.read()) != -1) {\n    read++;\n    if (ch == ' '){\n        // Get keyword\n        final ByteArrayOutputStream coll = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n        while((ch = i.read()) != -1) {\n            read++;\n            if (ch == '='){ // end of keyword\n                // ...\n            } else if (ch == '\\n') { // blank line\n                break;\n            }\n            coll.write((byte) ch);\n        }\n        break;\n    }\n    len *= 10;\n    len += ch - '0';\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Robust Parsing Algorithm\nA more robust fix would be to use a more advanced parsing algorithm that can handle malformed headers and blank lines. This could involve using a regular expression or a parsing library to extract the header information. Here's an example of how the code could be modified using a regular expression:\n```java\nfinal Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"^(\\\\d+) (.*)$\");\nfinal Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(new String(IOUtils.readFully(i, len)));\nif (matcher.matches()) {\n    final int length = Integer.parseInt(matcher.group(1));\n    final String keyword = matcher.group(2);\n    // ...\n}\n```\nNote that this is just one possible implementation, and the actual code would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project."
