The `addValue` function is supposed to add 1 to the frequency count for a given value `v`. It checks if `v` is an instance of `Integer` and converts it to a `Long` if necessary. Then, it tries to retrieve the current count from the `freqTable` and update it. If `v` is not comparable to existing values, it should throw a `ClassCastException`. However, the test case `testAddNonComparable` reveals that the function throws an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of a `ClassCastException` when adding a non-comparable value after adding a comparable value.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `addValue` function catches the `ClassCastException` thrown by the `freqTable` and re-throws an `IllegalArgumentException` instead.
