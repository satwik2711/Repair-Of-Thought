    "The root cause of the bug is that the `ExternalTypeHandler` is not properly handling the case where the external type ID is not the first property in the JSON data. This is causing the deserialization process to fail when trying to set the value for the creator property.": [
      "Modify ExternalTypeHandler to Handle External Type ID Property\nWe can modify the `ExternalTypeHandler` to add a check to see if the current property is the external type ID. If it is, we can handle it accordingly by setting the value for the creator property. Here is an example of how we can modify the `ExternalTypeHandler`:\n```java\nif (ext.handlePropertyValue(p, ctxt, propName, buffer)) {\n    if (propName.equals(ext.getExternalTypeIdPropertyName())) {\n        // Handle the external type ID property\n        ext.handleExternalTypeIdProperty(p, ctxt, buffer);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis modification will allow the `ExternalTypeHandler` to properly handle the case where the external type ID is not the first property in the JSON data.",
      "Add Fallback Setter for Creator Property\nAnother possible solution is to add a fallback setter for the creator property. This will allow the deserialization process to set the value for the creator property even if it is not the first property in the JSON data. Here is an example of how we can add a fallback setter:\n```java\npublic class CreatorProperty {\n    // ...\n    public void set(Object instance, Object value) {\n        if (instance instanceof MyObject) {\n            ((MyObject) instance).setMyProperty(value);\n        } else {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"No fallback setter/field defined: can not use creator property for \" + getClass().getName());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis modification will allow the deserialization process to set the value for the creator property even if it is not the first property in the JSON data.",
      "Reorder Properties in JSON Data\nA simpler solution is to reorder the properties in the JSON data so that the external type ID is always the first property. This will ensure that the `ExternalTypeHandler` can properly handle the external type ID property. Here is an example of how we can reorder the properties in the JSON data:\n```java\nfinal String successCase = \"{\\\"class\\\":\\\"\" + CLASS + \"\\\",\\\"payload\\\":{\\\"something\\\":\\\"test\\\"}}\";\n```\nThis modification will ensure that the external type ID is always the first property in the JSON data, which will allow the `ExternalTypeHandler` to properly handle it."
