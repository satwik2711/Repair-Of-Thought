The function `parseContextTypeExpression` is supposed to parse a context type expression, which can be either a basic type expression or a '?' character. However, the function simply calls `parseTypeName(token)` without considering the '?' character. The trigger test `testStructuralConstructor3` is testing a type annotation with a structural constructor, and the error message indicates a syntax error in the type annotation. This suggests that the bug is related to the parsing of the '?' character in the context type expression.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is that the `parseContextTypeExpression` function does not handle the '?' character correctly.
