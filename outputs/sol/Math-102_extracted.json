    "The chiSquare function is not correctly rescaling the expected array to ensure that the sum of the expected and observed counts are equal. This is causing the calculated chi-square test statistic to be incorrect.": [
      "Rescale Expected Array\nWe can rescale the expected array by dividing each element by the sum of the expected array and multiplying by the sum of the observed array. This will ensure that the sum of the expected and observed counts are equal. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\ndouble sumObserved = 0.0d;\nfor (int i = 0; i < observed.length; i++) {\n    sumObserved += observed[i];\n}\ndouble sumExpected = 0.0d;\nfor (int i = 0; i < expected.length; i++) {\n    sumExpected += expected[i];\n}\ndouble[] rescaledExpected = new double[expected.length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < expected.length; i++) {\n    rescaledExpected[i] = expected[i] * sumObserved / sumExpected;\n}\ndouble sumSq = 0.0d;\ndouble dev = 0.0d;\nfor (int i = 0; i < observed.length; i++) {\n    dev = ((double) observed[i] - rescaledExpected[i]);\n    sumSq += dev * dev / rescaledExpected[i];\n}\nreturn sumSq;\n```",
      "Use a Different Calculation Method\nInstead of using the formula sum((obs - exp)^2/exp), we can use the formula sum((obs - exp)^2/(exp + obs)) to calculate the chi-square test statistic. This method is more robust and can handle cases where the expected counts are zero. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\ndouble sumSq = 0.0d;\ndouble dev = 0.0d;\nfor (int i = 0; i < observed.length; i++) {\n    dev = ((double) observed[i] - expected[i]);\n    sumSq += dev * dev / (expected[i] + observed[i]);\n}\nreturn sumSq;\n```",
      "Check for Zero Expected Counts\nWe can add a check to ensure that the expected counts are not zero before calculating the chi-square test statistic. If any expected count is zero, we can throw an IllegalArgumentException. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\nfor (int i = 0; i < expected.length; i++) {\n    if (expected[i] == 0) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Expected count cannot be zero\");\n    }\n}\ndouble sumSq = 0.0d;\ndouble dev = 0.0d;\nfor (int i = 0; i < observed.length; i++) {\n    dev = ((double) observed[i] - expected[i]);\n    sumSq += dev * dev / expected[i];\n}\nreturn sumSq;\n```"
