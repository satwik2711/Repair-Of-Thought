    "The root cause of the bug is that the `OptionBuilder` properties are not being reset properly after creating an `Option` instance. Specifically, the `description` property is not being reset, causing the next `Option` instance to inherit the description from the previous creation. This is because the `OptionBuilder.reset()` method is not resetting the `description` property correctly.": [
      "Reset Description Property\nWe can modify the `OptionBuilder.reset()` method to reset the `description` property correctly. We can add a line to set the `description` property to `null` or an empty string. This will ensure that the next `Option` instance does not inherit the description from the previous creation. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic static void reset() {\n    // ... existing code ...\n    description = null;\n}\n```",
      "Use a New OptionBuilder Instance\nAnother approach is to create a new `OptionBuilder` instance for each `Option` creation. This will ensure that the `OptionBuilder` properties are reset properly and do not affect the next `Option` instance. We can modify the `create(String opt)` method to create a new `OptionBuilder` instance before creating the `Option` instance. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic static Option create(String opt) throws IllegalArgumentException {\n    OptionBuilder newBuilder = new OptionBuilder();\n    // ... existing code ...\n}\n```",
      "Set Description to Null After Option Creation\nWe can modify the `create(String opt)` method to set the `description` property to `null` after creating the `Option` instance. This will ensure that the next `Option` instance does not inherit the description from the previous creation. The modified code would be:\n```java\npublic static Option create(String opt) throws IllegalArgumentException {\n    // ... existing code ...\n    Option option = new Option(opt, description);\n    // ... existing code ...\n    description = null;\n    return option;\n}\n```"
