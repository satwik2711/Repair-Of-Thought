    "The root cause of the bug is that the equals method is not correctly handling the case where the two Complex numbers have the same real and imaginary parts but are not the same object. This is because the method is using the '==' operator to compare the objects, which checks for reference equality rather than value equality. Additionally, the method is not correctly handling the case where the other object is not an instance of Complex, as it is catching the ClassCastException and ignoring it, which can lead to incorrect results.": [
      "Override the equals method to compare the real and imaginary parts of the Complex numbers using the equals method of the Double class.\nThis solution would involve modifying the equals method to use the equals method of the Double class to compare the real and imaginary parts of the Complex numbers. This would ensure that the method correctly handles the case where the two Complex numbers have the same real and imaginary parts but are not the same object.
