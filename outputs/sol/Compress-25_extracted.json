    "The root cause of the bug is that the `PushbackInputStream` is not being properly initialized with the correct buffer size. The `buf.capacity()` method is being used to get the capacity of the buffer, but this method returns the current capacity of the buffer, not the maximum capacity. As a result, the `PushbackInputStream` is being initialized with a buffer size that is too small, causing the contents of the entry to be truncated.": [
      "Increase Buffer Size to a Fixed Value\nOne possible fix is to increase the buffer size used to initialize the `PushbackInputStream`. This can be done by replacing the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());` with `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, 1024);`. This will increase the buffer size to 1024 bytes, which should be sufficient to hold the contents of the entry.",
      "Use a Larger Buffer Size\nAnother possible fix is to use a larger buffer to initialize the `PushbackInputStream`. This can be done by replacing the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());` with `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, 4096);`. This will increase the buffer size to 4096 bytes, which should be sufficient to hold the contents of the entry.",
      "Use a Dynamic Buffer Size Based on Entry Size\nA third possible fix is to use a dynamic buffer size that is based on the size of the entry. This can be done by replacing the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());` with `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, ze.getSize());`. This will set the buffer size to the size of the entry, which should ensure that the contents of the entry are not truncated."
