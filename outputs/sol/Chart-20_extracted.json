    "The issue arises from the constructor of the ValueMarker class. In the call to the superclass constructor (super(paint, stroke, paint, stroke, alpha)), it mistakenly passes the paint and stroke again instead of the outlinePaint and outlineStroke. This results in the outlinePaint being set to the same value as the paint, which is Color.red in this case, instead of the intended Color.blue.": [
      "Correct Parameter Passing\nThe constructor should pass the correct parameters to the superclass constructor. The corrected line should look like this: super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);",
      "Input Validation\nBefore passing the parameters to the superclass constructor, validate them to ensure they are not null and are within the expected ranges. This can be achieved by adding checks at the beginning of the constructor to verify the parameters.",
      "Constructor Refactoring\nRefactor the constructor to clearly distinguish between the paint and outline paint parameters. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each parameter and the expected behavior, making the code more readable and maintainable.\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"}"
