The `expandCurrentSegment` method is designed to increase the size of the current segment to accommodate more contiguous content.

The error occurs when the buffer length is 262145, which is close to the maximum segment length.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The issue arises from the calculation of the new buffer length in the `expandCurrentSegment` method. When the current buffer length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN`, the new length is set to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN + 1`, which is incorrect because it does not actually increase the buffer size. This is due to the fact that the `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` is likely a power of 2 (262144 in this case), and adding 1 to it does not change the buffer size when copying the array using `Arrays.copyOf`.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Exploring Potential Fixes\",\n    \"content\": \"Now, let's explore possible solutions to fix the bug.

This approach ensures that the buffer size increases rapidly, even when the current length is close to the maximum segment length.\n\nSuggestion 3: Handle Maximum Segment Length as a Special Case\nHandle the case where the current buffer length is equal to `MAX_SEGMENT_LEN` as a special case. In this case, increase the buffer size by a fixed amount (e.g., 1024) or use a different growth strategy to ensure that the buffer size increases correctly.\n\nSuggestion 4: Use a More Robust Array Copy Method\nUse a more robust array copy method, such as `System.arraycopy`, which can handle cases where the source and destination arrays have different lengths.
