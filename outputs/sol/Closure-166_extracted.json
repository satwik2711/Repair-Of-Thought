    "The root cause of this bug is that the `matchConstraint` function is not correctly handling the union type of the function parameter. Specifically, when the constraint object is a union type of two record types, the function is not correctly merging the properties of the two record types. This is because the function is only checking if the constraint object is a record type, and if so, it calls `matchRecordTypeConstraint` with the constraint object converted to an object type. However, this conversion loses the union type information, resulting in an empty object type being inferred.": [
      "Handle Union Type of Record Constraints\nOne possible fix is to add a new method `matchUnionTypeConstraint` that takes a union type of record constraints and merges the properties of the two record types. We can then call this method from `matchConstraint` when the constraint object is a union type of two record types. This approach requires adding a new method, which may increase the complexity of the code.",
      "Modify matchRecordTypeConstraint to Handle Union Type\nAnother possible fix is to modify the `matchRecordTypeConstraint` method to handle the union type of the function parameter. We can do this by checking if the constraint object is a union type, and if so, recursively calling `matchRecordTypeConstraint` on each of the union types. This approach requires modifying an existing method, which may break existing functionality.",
      "Use a Different Approach to Merge Properties\nA third possible fix is to use a different approach to merge the properties of the two record types. For example, we could use a map to keep track of the properties and their types, and then use this map to construct the final object type. This approach may be less efficient than the other two suggestions, but it may be easier to implement and understand."
