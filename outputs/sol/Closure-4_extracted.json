    "The root cause of the bug is that the function resolveInternal does not properly handle cycles in the inheritance chain. When a cycle is detected, the function handleTypeCycle is called, but it does not prevent the cycle from causing an error. The function should be modified to prevent cycles from causing errors.": [
      "Prevent Cycles from Causing Errors\nWe can modify the function resolveInternal to prevent cycles from causing errors by adding a check for cycles before calling the function handleTypeCycle. If a cycle is detected, we can return an error message instead of throwing an exception. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // ...\n  if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {\n    return errorReporter.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and effective, but it may not be the most efficient way to handle cycles.",
      "Use a Different Mechanism for Resolving Named Types\nWe can modify the function resolveInternal to use a different mechanism for resolving named types, such as using a graph to keep track of the inheritance chain. This would allow us to detect cycles more efficiently and prevent them from causing errors. Here is an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nJSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {\n  // Create a graph to keep track of the inheritance chain\n  Graph<JSType> graph = new Graph<>();\n  // ...\n  if (graph.hasCycle()) {\n    return errorReporter.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\nThis solution is more complex, but it may be more efficient and scalable.",
      "Modify the Function handleTypeCycle\nWe can modify the function handleTypeCycle to prevent cycles from causing errors. Instead of throwing an exception, the function can return an error message or a special value indicating that a cycle was detected. Here is an example of how the modified code could look:\n```java\nvoid handleTypeCycle(ErrorReporter t) {\n  // Instead of throwing an exception, return an error message\n  t.report(ErrorMessages.CYCLE_DETECTED_IN_INHERITANCE_CHAIN);\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple, but it may not be the most effective way to handle cycles, as it does not prevent the cycle from causing an error."
