    "The root cause of the bug is that the 'g' variable, which represents the gray color value, is calculated using the original input 'value' instead of the clamped 'v' value. This means that when the input 'value' is outside the bounds, it can result in a 'g' value that is also outside the valid range of 0-255, causing the IllegalArgumentException.": [
      "Use Clamped Value for Color Calculation\nThe calculation for the 'g' value should use the clamped 'v' value instead of the original 'value'. This ensures that the 'g' value is always within the valid range of 0-255. The modified code would be:\nint g = (int) ((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);\nreturn new Color(g, g, g);",
      "Validate Color Value Before Creating Color Object\nAnother approach is to validate the 'g' value before creating the Color object. If the 'g' value is outside the valid range, we can clamp it to the nearest valid value. The modified code would be:\nint g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);\ng = Math.max(0, Math.min(255, g));\nreturn new Color(g, g, g);",
      "Calculate Color Value with Clamped Input\nWe can also calculate the 'g' value using the clamped input 'v' directly, without needing to clamp the 'g' value separately. The modified code would be:\ndouble v = Math.max(value, this.lowerBound);\nv = Math.min(v, this.upperBound);\nint g = (int) ((v - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);\nreturn new Color(g, g, g);"
