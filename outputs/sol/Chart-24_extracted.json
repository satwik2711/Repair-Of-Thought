    "The issue is with the calculation of the color parameter 'g' when the input value is outside the bounds. The calculation (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0) does not take into account the case when the input value is outside the bounds, resulting in a value of 'g' that is outside the valid range of 0-255.": [
      "Clamp Input Value to Bounds\nClamp the input value to the bounds before calculating 'g'. This can be done by replacing the line 'int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);' with 'int g = (int) ((Math.max(this.lowerBound, Math.min(value, this.upperBound)) - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);'. This ensures that the input value is within the bounds before calculating 'g', preventing the calculation from resulting in a value outside the valid range.",
      "Use Math.max and Math.min to Clamp 'g'\nUse Math.max and Math.min to clamp the value of 'g' to the valid range of 0-255. This can be done by replacing the line 'int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);' with 'int g = Math.max(0, Math.min(255, (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0)));'. This ensures that the value of 'g' is within the valid range, preventing the error from occurring.",
      "Handle Out-of-Bounds Values Separately\nHandle out-of-bounds values separately by checking if the input value is outside the bounds and returning a default color in that case. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function and returning a default color if the input value is outside the bounds. For example, 'if (value < this.lowerBound) return Color.black; if (value > this.upperBound) return Color.white;'. This ensures that the function handles out-of-bounds values correctly, preventing the error from occurring."
