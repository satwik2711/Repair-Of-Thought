    "The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the initial guess is close to the root. The function is returning the initial guess as the root instead of the actual root value. This is because the function is checking if the absolute value of the function at the initial guess is less than or equal to the function value accuracy, and if so, it returns the initial guess as the root. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that the initial guess is actually the root.": [
      "Add an Additional Check to Ensure the Initial Guess is Actually the Root\nWe can add an additional check to ensure that the initial guess is actually the root. We can do this by checking if the function value at the initial guess is close to zero, and if so, to return the initial guess as the root. This can be achieved by modifying the code as follows:\n```java\nif (Math.abs(yInitial) <= functionValueAccuracy) {\n    if (Math.abs(f.value(initial)) < functionValueAccuracy) {\n        setResult(initial, 0);\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis suggestion adds an additional check to ensure that the initial guess is actually the root, and if so, returns the initial guess as the root.",
      "Use a More Robust Method to Find the Root\nWe can use a more robust method to find the root, such as the bisection method or the secant method. These methods are more reliable and can handle cases where the initial guess is not close to the root. We can modify the code to use the bisection method as follows:\n```java\n// Use the bisection method to find the root\ndouble root = bisectionMethod(f, min, max, initial);\nsetResult(root, 0);\nreturn result;\n```\nThis suggestion uses a more robust method to find the root, which can handle cases where the initial guess is not close to the root.",
