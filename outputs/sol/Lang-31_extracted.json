    "The root cause of the bug is that the `containsAny` function is not correctly handling supplementary characters. In Java, supplementary characters are represented by two `char` values, known as a surrogate pair. The function is currently checking each character in the string individually, without considering the possibility that a character may be part of a surrogate pair. This means that the function is not correctly identifying supplementary characters, leading to incorrect results.": [
      "Use Code Points Instead of Characters\nThis approach involves using the `codePointAt` method to get the code point of each character in the string, and then checking if the code point is present in the search array. This approach correctly handles supplementary characters, as it treats each code point as a single unit. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\npublic static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {\n    if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    int csLength = cs.length();\n    for (int i = 0; i < csLength; ) {\n        int codePoint = cs.codePointAt(i);\n        for (char searchChar : searchChars) {\n            if (codePoint == searchChar) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        i += Character.charCount(codePoint);\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Surrogate Pair Detection Algorithm\nThis approach involves checking each character in the string to see if it is part of a surrogate pair, and if so, treating it as a single unit. This approach also correctly handles supplementary characters, as it identifies and treats them as single units. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\npublic static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {\n    if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    int csLength = cs.length();\n    for (int i = 0; i < csLength; ) {\n        char ch = cs.charAt(i);\n        if (Character.isHighSurrogate(ch) && i + 1 < csLength) {\n            char lowSurrogate = cs.charAt(i + 1);\n            if (Character.isLowSurrogate(lowSurrogate)) {\n                int codePoint = Character.toCodePoint(ch, lowSurrogate);\n                for (char searchChar : searchChars) {\n                    if (codePoint == searchChar) {\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                }\n                i += 2;\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n        for (char searchChar : searchChars) {\n            if (ch == searchChar) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```",
      "Use a Regular Expression\nThis approach involves using a regular expression to search for the presence of a character in the string. This approach correctly handles supplementary characters, as it uses a regular expression that is designed to handle them correctly. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\npublic static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {\n    if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    String regex = \"[\" + new String(searchChars) + \"]\";\n    return cs.toString().matches(\".*\" + regex + \".*\");\n}\n```"
