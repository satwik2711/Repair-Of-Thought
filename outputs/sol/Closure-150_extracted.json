    "The issue arises from the fact that the `visit` function does not correctly handle namespaced function stubs. Specifically, when a namespaced function stub is encountered, the function does not add the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table. This is because the `visit` function only checks if the parent node is a `NAME` node, but in the case of a namespaced function stub, the parent node is the object that the function is being stubbed on.": [
      "Add Special Handling for Namespaced Function Stubs\nOne possible solution is to add a special case to handle namespaced function stubs. We can do this by checking if the parent node is an object and if the current node is a function stub. If so, we can add the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table. This can be achieved by adding the following code:\n```java\nif (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION && parent.getType() == Token.OBJECT) {\n  defineNamespacedFunctionStub(n, parent);\n}\n```\nThis code adds a special case to handle namespaced function stubs and calls the `defineNamespacedFunctionStub` method to add the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table.",
      "Modify the `defineDeclaredFunction` Method\nAnother possible solution is to modify the `defineDeclaredFunction` method to handle namespaced function stubs. We can do this by checking if the parent node is an object and if the current node is a function stub. If so, we can add the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table. This can be achieved by modifying the `defineDeclaredFunction` method as follows:\n```java\nprivate void defineDeclaredFunction(Node n, Node parent) {\n  if (parent.getType() == Token.OBJECT) {\n    defineNamespacedFunctionStub(n, parent);\n  } else {\n    // existing code\n  }\n}\n```\nThis code modifies the `defineDeclaredFunction` method to handle namespaced function stubs and adds the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table.",
      "Add a New Method to Handle Namespaced Function Stubs\nA third possible solution is to add a new method to handle namespaced function stubs. This method can be called from the `visit` function when a namespaced function stub is encountered. The new method can add the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table. This can be achieved by adding the following code:\n```java\nprivate void handleNamespacedFunctionStub(Node n, Node parent) {\n  if (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION && parent.getType() == Token.OBJECT) {\n    defineNamespacedFunctionStub(n, parent);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis code adds a new method to handle namespaced function stubs and calls the `defineNamespacedFunctionStub` method to add the property to the corresponding object in the local symbol table. The `handleNamespacedFunctionStub` method can be called from the `visit` function as follows:\n```java\nif (n.getType() == Token.FUNCTION) {\n  handleNamespacedFunctionStub(n, parent);\n}\n```"
