    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` is not correctly checking if the Node is a FUNCTION or DO when it is preceded by a label. The function is only checking the type of the Node, but it is not considering the context in which the Node is being used. Specifically, it is not checking if the Node is enclosed in a block or if it is preceded by a label.": [
      "Check for Label Precedence\nOne possible fix is to modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to check if the Node is preceded by a label. We can do this by checking if the Node's parent is a label, and if so, checking if the label is enclosed in a block. If the label is not enclosed in a block, we can return false, indicating that the Node is not a FUNCTION or DO.",
      "Check for Block Enclosure\nAnother possible fix is to modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to check if the Node is enclosed in a block. We can do this by checking if the Node's parent is a block, and if so, checking if the block has only one child. If the block has only one child, we can return true, indicating that the Node is a FUNCTION or DO.",
      "Combine Label and Block Checks\nA third possible fix is to combine the label and block checks. We can modify the function `isOneExactlyFunctionOrDo` to check if the Node is preceded by a label, and if so, check if the label is enclosed in a block. We can also check if the Node is enclosed in a block, and if so, check if the block has only one child. If both conditions are met, we can return true, indicating that the Node is a FUNCTION or DO.\n\nHere is the modified code for",
