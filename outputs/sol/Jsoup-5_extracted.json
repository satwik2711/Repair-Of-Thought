    "The bug occurs when the attribute key is empty and the code attempts to consume the next character without checking if it's within the bounds of the token queue. This happens because the `tq.consume()` call is not conditional on the presence of a non-empty key.": [
      "Check for Empty Key Before Consuming\nWe can add a conditional check before calling `tq.consume()` to ensure that the key is not empty. If the key is empty, we can return null immediately without attempting to consume the next character. This approach is straightforward and directly addresses the root cause of the bug.",
      "Handle Empty Key with a Default Value\nAlternatively, we can handle the case where the attribute key is empty by returning a default value, such as an empty string or a special attribute object. This approach would require modifying the `Attribute.createFromEncoded` method to handle the default value. This solution provides a more robust handling of empty keys, but it may require additional changes to the surrounding code.",
      "Skip Consuming Next Character for Empty Key\nAnother approach is to skip consuming the next character when the attribute key is empty. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the key is empty before calling `tq.consume()`. This solution is similar to Suggestion 1, but it avoids returning null immediately, instead allowing the parsing to continue. However, this approach may lead to incorrect parsing results if the empty key is not properly handled later in the parsing process."
