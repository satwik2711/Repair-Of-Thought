    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `unixTimeToZipLong` checks if the input value is greater than or equal to `2^32`, but it does not check if the input value is greater than or equal to `2^32 - 1`. This is because the maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer is `2^32 - 1`, not `2^32`. As a result, when the input value is `2^32`, the function throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, even though the value can be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer.": [
      "Update the Check for 32-bit Unsigned Integer\nWe can update the check in the function `unixTimeToZipLong` to check if the input value is greater than or equal to `2^32 - 1`, instead of `2^32`. This will ensure that the function does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when the input value is `2^32`. The updated function would be:\n```java\nprivate static ZipLong unixTimeToZipLong(long l) {\n    final long TWO_TO_32_MINUS_ONE = 0xFFFFFFFFL;\n    if (l >= TWO_TO_32_MINUS_ONE) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"X5455 timestamps must fit in a signed 32 bit integer: \" + l);\n    }\n    return new ZipLong(l);\n}\n```",
      "Use a Larger Data Type\nAnother potential fix is to use a larger data type, such as a 64-bit integer, to represent the `ZipLong` value. This will allow the function to handle larger input values without throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. However, this solution may require additional changes to the surrounding code to accommodate the larger data type.",
      "Handle the Edge Case\nWe can also handle the edge case where the input value is `2^32` by adding a special check for this value. If the input value is `2^32`, we can return a special value, such as `null`, to indicate that the value is too big to be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer. This solution is more complex and may require additional error handling, but it provides a way to handle the edge case without changing the underlying data type."
