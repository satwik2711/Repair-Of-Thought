This check can verify whether the bracketing interval has converged to a certain tolerance. If the interval has not converged, the solver can terminate and throw an exception. This fix can prevent the solver from getting stuck in an infinite loop. The convergence check can be implemented by adding a condition to check if the difference between the current bracketing interval and the previous one is less than a certain tolerance.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Different Interpolation Method\nUse a different interpolation method, such as linear interpolation or quadratic interpolation, instead of inverse polynomial interpolation. This can help the solver to converge faster and avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop. Linear interpolation, for example, can be used to estimate the next point by interpolating between the current bracketing interval. This method is simpler and more robust than inverse polynomial interpolation.\n\nSuggestion 3: Implement a Maximum Number of Iterations\nImplement a maximum number of iterations for the solver. This can prevent the solver from getting stuck in an infinite loop and exceeding the maximal count of evaluations. The maximum number of iterations can be set based on the desired level of accuracy and the computational resources available. If the solver reaches the maximum number of iterations without converging, it can terminate and throw an exception.",
