    "The bug is caused by the fact that the `toFormatter` function does not handle the case where the first element is a separator and the `notPrinter` or `notParser` flag is true. In this case, the function tries to create a `PeriodFormatter` with a null printer or parser, which leads to a `NullPointerException` when trying to parse a period string.": [
      "Handle Separator with Null Printer or Parser\nWe can add a check before recursively creating a `PeriodFormatter` for the rest of the elements. If the `notPrinter` or `notParser` flag is true, we can throw an exception or return a default `PeriodFormatter` instance. This would prevent the `NullPointerException` and ensure that the function behaves correctly even when the first element is a separator and the `notPrinter` or `notParser` flag is true.",
      "Create a Composite Formatter with Separator\nWe can create a composite formatter from the elements, including the separator, even if the `notPrinter` or `notParser` flag is true. This would allow the separator to be used in the formatting process and prevent the `NullPointerException`. However, this approach may require additional logic to handle the separator correctly in the composite formatter.",
      "Modify the Separator Handling\nWe can modify the separator handling to not recursively create a `PeriodFormatter` for the rest of the elements. Instead, we can create a new `PeriodFormatter` instance with the separator and the rest of the elements. This would prevent the `NullPointerException` and ensure that the function behaves correctly even when the first element is a separator and the `notPrinter` or `notParser` flag is true. However, this approach may require significant changes to the existing code and may have unintended consequences."
