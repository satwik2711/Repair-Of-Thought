    "The buggy function is not correctly handling unnamed functions. When an unnamed function is encountered, the function is setting the line number and character number of the function name to the line number and character number of the left parenthesis. However, this is not correct because the left parenthesis is not the actual name of the function. This is causing the parser to fail when trying to parse an unnamed function statement.": [
      "Set Correct Line Number and Character Number for Unnamed Functions\nInstead of setting the line number and character number of the function name to the line number and character number of the left parenthesis, we should set it to the line number and character number of the function keyword. This will correctly identify the location of the unnamed function. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (isUnnamedFunction) {\n    newName.setLineno(functionNode.getLineno());\n    int fnColumn = functionNode.getAbsolutePosition() +\n        functionNode.getFunctionKeywordOffset();\n    newName.setCharno(position2charno(fnColumn));\n}\n```\nThis modification correctly sets the line number and character number of the function name to the line number and character number of the function keyword, which should fix the bug.",
      "Use a Special Token for Unnamed Functions\nWe could introduce a special token for unnamed functions, which would allow us to correctly handle them without having to modify the existing logic for named functions. This would involve adding a new token type and updating the parser to recognize it. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (isUnnamedFunction) {\n    newName.setType(Token.UNNAMED_FUNCTION);\n    newName.setLineno(functionNode.getLineno());\n    newName.setCharno(functionNode.getAbsolutePosition());\n}\n```\nThis modification introduces a new token type for unnamed functions and sets the line number and character number of the function name accordingly.",
      "Modify the Parser to Ignore Unnamed Functions\nAnother possible solution would be to modify the parser to ignore unnamed functions altogether. This would involve updating the parser to skip over unnamed functions when encountered, rather than trying to parse them. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (isUnnamedFunction) {\n    return null; // ignore unnamed functions\n}\n```\nThis modification simply ignores unnamed functions and returns null, which would prevent the parser from trying to parse them."
