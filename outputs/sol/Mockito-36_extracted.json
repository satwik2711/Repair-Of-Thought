    "The root cause of the bug is that the `callRealMethod()` function is not properly handling the case where the mock object is an interface. When an interface is mocked, Mockito generates a proxy object that implements the interface. However, the proxy object does not have the same methods as the interface, which is causing the `NoSuchMethodError`. The `callRealMethod()` function is not checking if the mock object is an interface before invoking the real method.": [
      "Check if Mock Object is an Interface\nOne possible fix is to add a check in the `callRealMethod()` function to see if the mock object is an interface. If it is, then the function can throw a `MockitoException` with a meaningful error message. This would prevent the `NoSuchMethodError` from being thrown and provide a more informative error message to the user. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\npublic Object callRealMethod() throws Throwable {\n    if (mock.getClass().isInterface()) {\n        throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface\");\n    }\n    return realMethod.invoke(mock, rawArguments);\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Method Invocation Strategy\nAnother possible fix is to use a different method invocation strategy when the mock object is an interface. For example, Mockito could use the `Method.invoke()` method instead of the `MethodProxy.invokeSuper()` method. This would allow the real method to be invoked on the mock object, even if it's an interface. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\npublic Object callRealMethod() throws Throwable {\n    if (mock.getClass().isInterface()) {\n        return realMethod.invoke(mock, rawArguments);\n    } else {\n        return realMethod.invoke(mock, rawArguments);\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Generate a More Informative Error Message\nA third possible fix is to generate a more informative error message when the `NoSuchMethodError` is thrown. This could include information about the mock object and the method that was being invoked. This would make it easier for the user to diagnose and fix the issue. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\npublic Object callRealMethod() throws Throwable {\n    try {\n        return realMethod.invoke(mock, rawArguments);\n    } catch (NoSuchMethodError e) {\n        throw new MockitoException(\"Cannot call real method on interface: \" + mock.getClass().getName() + \".\" + realMethod.getName());\n    }\n}\n```"
