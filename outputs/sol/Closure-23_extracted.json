    "The bug is caused by the fact that the function tryFoldArrayAccess does not handle the case where the array index is a non-integer number that is within the bounds of the array. In the test case 'x = [10, 20][0.5]', the index 0.5 is not an integer, but it is within the bounds of the array. The function should return the original node in this case, but instead, it throws an error.": [
      "Return Original Node for Non-Integer Index\nOne possible fix is to return the original node when the array index is a non-integer number. This can be done by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function. If the index is not an integer, the function can return the original node without attempting to optimize the array access. This approach ensures that the function works correctly with non-integer indices and avoids throwing unnecessary errors.",
      "Throw Error for Non-Integer Index\nAnother possible fix is to throw an error when the array index is a non-integer number. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function and throwing an error if the index is not an integer. This approach is more strict and ensures that the function only works with integer indices. However, it may not be desirable in all cases, as it can lead to errors being thrown unnecessarily.",
      "Use Math.floor() to Round Down Index\nA third possible fix is to use Math.floor() to round down the index to the nearest integer. This approach ensures that the function works with non-integer indices, but it may not always produce the desired result. For example, if the index is 0.5, the function will round it down to 0, which may not be the intended behavior. However, this approach can be useful in cases where the index is close to an integer value."
