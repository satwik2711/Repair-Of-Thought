    "The root cause of the bug is that the function does not check if the input buffer has a length of at least 2 before attempting to parse it. This is a requirement specified in the function's documentation. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the case where the input buffer contains only NULs, which should be a valid input and return 0L according to the function's documentation.": [
      "Add Length Check\nAdd a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input buffer has a length of at least 2. If the length is less than 2, throw an IllegalArgumentException with a suitable error message.
