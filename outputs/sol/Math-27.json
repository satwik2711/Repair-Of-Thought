The function `percentageValue()` is supposed to calculate the fraction percentage as a `double`. The trigger test `testMath835()` creates a `Fraction` object with a large numerator and a small denominator, and then asserts that the `percentageValue()` of this fraction is equal to the manually calculated percentage. However, the assertion fails with an error message indicating that the expected value is `2.1691754E9` but the actual value is `-2.125791896E9`. This suggests that the `percentageValue()` function is not handling large numerators correctly.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Analyzing Root Cause\",\n    \"content\": \"Root Cause: The root cause of this bug is likely due to integer overflow when calculating the numerator multiplied by 100. The `multiply(100)` function is not shown in the provided code, but it is likely that it multiplies the numerator by 100, which can cause an integer overflow when the numerator is large. This overflow results in a negative value, which is then divided by the denominator, resulting in an incorrect percentage value.\",\n    \"next_action\": \"continue\"\n}\n\n{\n    \"title\": \"Exploring Potential Fixes\",\n    \"content\": \"Now, let's explore potential fixes for this bug.
