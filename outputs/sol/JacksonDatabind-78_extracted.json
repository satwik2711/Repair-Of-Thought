    "The root cause of this bug is that the `createBeanDeserializer` function is not properly checking for classes that are not allowed to be deserialized for security reasons. The function is checking if the class is a potential bean type, but it's not checking if the class is in the list of classes that are not allowed to be deserialized.": [
      "Add a new method to check if the class is in the list of blacklisted classes\nAdd a new method `isBlacklistedClass` that checks if the class is in the list of blacklisted classes. This method can be called before the `isPotentialBeanType` method to ensure that the class is not blacklisted before trying to deserialize it. The `isBlacklistedClass` method can be implemented as follows:\n```java\nprivate boolean isBlacklistedClass(Class<?> clazz) {\n    // Get the list of blacklisted classes\n    List<Class<?>> blacklistedClasses = getBlacklistedClasses();\n    \n    // Check if the class is in the list of blacklisted classes\n    return blacklistedClasses.contains(clazz);\n}\n```\nThe `getBlacklistedClasses` method can be implemented to return a list of classes that are not allowed to be deserialized.",
      "Modify the existing `isPotentialBeanType` method to also check if the class is in the list of blacklisted classes\nModify the existing `isPotentialBeanType` method to also check if the class is in the list of blacklisted classes. This can be done by adding a new parameter to the method that specifies the list of blacklisted classes. The modified method can be implemented as follows:\n```java\nprivate boolean isPotentialBeanType(Class<?> clazz, List<Class<?>> blacklistedClasses) {\n    // Check if the class is in the list of blacklisted classes\n    if (blacklistedClasses.contains(clazz)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n    // Check if the class is a potential bean type\n    return isPotentialBeanType(clazz);\n}\n```\nThe `isPotentialBeanType` method can be called with the list of blacklisted classes as a parameter to ensure that the class is not blacklisted before trying to deserialize it.",
      "Use a whitelist approach instead of a blacklist approach\nInstead of maintaining a list of blacklisted classes, we can maintain a list of whitelisted classes that are allowed to be deserialized. This approach can be more secure than the blacklist approach, but it may require more maintenance to ensure that all allowed classes are included in the whitelist. The `isPotentialBeanType` method can be modified to check if the class is in the list of whitelisted classes instead of checking if it's in the list of blacklisted classes. The modified method can be implemented as follows:\n```java\nprivate boolean isPotentialBeanType(Class<?> clazz) {\n    // Get the list of whitelisted classes\n    List<Class<?>> whitelistedClasses = getWhitelistedClasses();\n    \n    // Check if the class is in the list of whitelisted classes\n    return whitelistedClasses.contains(clazz);\n}\n```\nThe `getWhitelistedClasses` method can be implemented to return a list of classes that are allowed to be deserialized."
