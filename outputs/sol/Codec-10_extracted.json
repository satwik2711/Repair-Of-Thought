    "The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of consecutive 'mb' in the input string. The function is replacing 'mb' with 'm2' and then removing all '2's, resulting in 'm' instead of 'mb' being encoded as 'MP'. This is because the function is not correctly handling the case where 'mb' appears at the end of the string.": [
      "Modify the Replacement Rule for 'mb'\nOne possible fix is to modify the replacement rule for 'mb' to replace it with 'MP' instead of 'm2'. This would ensure that consecutive 'mb' is correctly encoded as 'MP'. The modified code would be: txt = txt.replaceAll(\"^mb\", \"MP\");. This change would need to be made in the section of the code that handles the start options.",
      "Add a Special Case for Consecutive 'mb'\nAnother possible fix is to add a special case for consecutive 'mb' in the input string. We can add a check after the replacement rules to see if the string ends with 'mb' and if so, replace it with 'MP'. The modified code would be: if (txt.endsWith(\"mb\")) { txt = txt.replaceAll(\"mb\", \"MP\"); }. This change would need to be made after the section of the code that handles the replacements.",
      "Modify the Removal Rule for '2'\nA third possible fix is to modify the removal rule for '2' to only remove '2's that are not part of a 'mb' sequence. This would ensure that consecutive 'mb' is correctly encoded as 'MP'. The modified code would be: txt = txt.replaceAll(\"2(?!m)\", \"\");. This change would need to be made in the section of the code that handles the removals."
