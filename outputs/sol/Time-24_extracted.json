    "The issue arises from the fact that the computeMillis method is not correctly handling the week-based date parsing. When the first field is month or day, the method alters the base year for parsing, but it does not correctly handle the case when the week is also present in the pattern. This leads to incorrect date calculations.": [
      "Correctly Handle Week-Based Date Parsing\nWe can modify the computeMillis method to correctly handle week-based date parsing by adding a check for the presence of the week field in the pattern. If the week field is present, we need to adjust the date calculation accordingly. This can be done by adding a new variable to track the week field and using it to adjust the date calculation. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\nif (compareReverse(first, months) >= 0 && compareReverse(first, days) <= 0) {\n    saveField(DateTimeFieldType.year(), iDefaultYear);\n    // Add a check for the presence of the week field\n    if (savedFields[0].iField.getDurationField() == DurationFieldType.weeks().getField(iChrono)) {\n        // Adjust the date calculation accordingly\n        int week = savedFields[0].getValue();\n        int year = iDefaultYear;\n        int month = 1;\n        int day = 1;\n        // Calculate the correct date based on the week\n        // ...\n    }\n    return computeMillis(resetFields, text);\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Approach for Date Calculation\nAnother approach to fix this issue is to use a different method for date calculation. Instead of using the computeMillis method, we can use a different method that correctly handles week-based date parsing. This can be done by creating a new method that takes into account the week field and uses it to calculate the correct date. Here is an example of how this can be done:\n\n```java\nprivate long computeMillisWithWeek(boolean resetFields, String text) {\n    // Calculate the correct date based on the week\n    int week = savedFields[0].getValue();\n    int year = iDefaultYear;\n    int month = 1;\n    int day = 1;\n    // ...\n    return millis;\n}\n```",
      "Modify the Pattern to Avoid Week-Based Date Parsing\nA third approach to fix this issue is to modify the pattern to avoid week-based date parsing. Instead of using the pattern 'yyyy-MM-ww', we can use a different pattern that does not include the week field. This can be done by changing the pattern to 'yyyy-MM-dd' or a similar pattern that does not include the week field. Here is an example of how this can be done:\n\n```java\nDateTimeFormatter f = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd\").withChronology(chrono);\n```"
