The `clone()` method is supposed to create a deep copy of the `Element` object, including its class names. However, the test case `testClonesClassnames()` is failing, indicating that the cloned object's class names are not being copied correctly.

When the cloned object's class names are modified, the original object's class names are also modified, causing the test to fail.\n\nSuggestion 1: Create a Deep Copy of Class Names\nWe can create a deep copy of the class names by using the `new HashSet<>()` constructor to create a new `classNames` set in the cloned object, and then copying the class names from the original object's `classNames` set to the new set using the `addAll()` method. This approach ensures that the cloned object has its own independent set of class names, which can be modified without affecting the original object.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames = new HashSet<>(classNames);\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Copy Constructor\nAlternatively, we can use a copy constructor to create a deep copy of the class names. We can create a new `Element` object and pass the original object's `classNames` set to the constructor, which will create a deep copy of the class names. This approach is more explicit and can be more efficient than creating a new set and copying the elements.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = new Element(this);\n    return clone;\n}\n\n// Assuming a copy constructor is defined in the Element class\npublic Element(Element original) {\n    this.classNames = new HashSet<>(original.classNames);\n}\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Use a Defensive Copy\nAnother approach is to use a defensive copy to create a deep copy of the class names. We can create a new `classNames` set in the cloned object and copy the class names from the original object's `classNames` set to the new set using the `addAll()` method. However, instead of using the `new HashSet<>()` constructor, we can use the `Collections.unmodifiableSet()` method to create an unmodifiable set, which ensures that the cloned object's class names cannot be modified accidentally.\n\n```java\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    clone.classNames = Collections.unmodifiableSet(new HashSet<>(classNames));\n    return clone;\n}\n```",
