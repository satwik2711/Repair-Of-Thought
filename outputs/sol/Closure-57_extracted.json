    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `extractClassNameIfGoog` does not correctly handle the case where the argument is not a string literal. The function assumes that the `target` node will always be a string literal, but in the case of `goog.require(foo)`, the `target` node is a variable reference. This causes the function to return the name of the variable instead of `null`.": [
      "Check if the target node is a string literal\nWe can modify the function to check if the `target` node is a string literal before returning its value. If it's not a string literal, we can return `null`. This can be achieved by adding a simple check:\n```java\nif (target != null && target.getType() == Token.STRINGLIT) {\n    className = target.getString();\n} else {\n    className = null;\n}\n```\nThis solution is simple and efficient, but it may not handle all cases correctly.",
      "Check if the target node is a variable reference\nWe can modify the function to check if the `target` node is a variable reference before returning its value. If it's a variable reference, we can return `null`. This can be achieved by adding a simple check:\n```java\nif (target != null && target.getType() == Token.NAME) {\n    className = null;\n} else {\n    className = target.getString();\n}\n```\nThis solution is more robust than the first one, but it may be slower.",
      "Use a more robust way to extract the class name\nWe can modify the function to use a more robust way to extract the class name, such as using a regular expression to match the `goog.require` statement. This can be achieved by replacing the existing logic with the following code:\n```java\nString regex = \"goog\\\\.require\\\\('([^']+)\\\\')\";\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);\nMatcher matcher = pattern.matcher(parent.getString());\nif (matcher.matches()) {\n    className = matcher.group(1);\n} else {\n    className = null;\n}\n```\nThis solution is the most robust, but it may be more complex to implement."
