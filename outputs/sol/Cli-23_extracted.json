    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `renderWrappedText` enters an infinite loop when the text is too long for the line and cannot be wrapped. This happens because the function does not correctly handle the case where the text is longer than the width and the padding added to the text does not allow it to be wrapped.": [
      "Increase the Width to Accommodate the Text\nIncrease the width of the line to accommodate the longest text. This can be done by modifying the `width` parameter of the `renderWrappedText` function to be the maximum length of the text. This will prevent the infinite loop and allow the text to be wrapped correctly.",
      "Implement a Maximum Number of Wraps\nImplement a maximum number of wraps to prevent the infinite loop. This can be done by adding a counter to the `while` loop and breaking out of the loop when the counter reaches a certain threshold. This will prevent the function from entering an infinite loop and will allow the text to be wrapped correctly.",
      "Remove the Padding from the Text\nRemove the padding from the text before wrapping it. This can be done by modifying the line `text = padding + text.substring(pos).trim();` to `text = text.substring(pos).trim();`. This will prevent the infinite loop and allow the text to be wrapped correctly.\n\n    \",\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}"
