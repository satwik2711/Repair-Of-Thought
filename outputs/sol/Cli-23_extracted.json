    "The root cause of the bug is the infinite loop that occurs when the text is too long for a line and cannot be wrapped. This happens because the findWrapPos function returns the same position repeatedly, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely. The current implementation does not handle cases where the text cannot be wrapped within the specified line width.": [
      "Truncate the Text\nTruncate the text to the maximum allowed width when it cannot be wrapped. This can be achieved by modifying the renderWrappedText function to truncate the text when the findWrapPos function returns the same position repeatedly. The function can be modified to check if the text is too long and truncate it to the maximum allowed width, preventing the infinite loop.",
      "Increase the Line Width\nIncrease the line width to accommodate the long description. This can be done by modifying the test case to use a larger line width or by adjusting the default line width in the HelpFormatter class. By increasing the line width, the text can be wrapped correctly, and the infinite loop can be avoided.",
      "Handle Infinite Loop with Counter\nHandle the infinite loop by adding a counter to track the number of iterations and break out of the loop when a maximum number of iterations is reached. This would prevent the RuntimeException from being thrown and allow the function to return a partially rendered text. The counter can be implemented as a simple integer variable that is incremented at each iteration, and the loop can be broken when the counter exceeds a predefined maximum value."
