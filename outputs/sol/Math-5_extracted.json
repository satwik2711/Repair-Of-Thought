    "The issue lies in the fact that the function is not correctly handling the case when the complex number is zero. In the current implementation, when the real and imaginary parts are both zero, the function returns `NaN` immediately. However, this is not the correct behavior for the reciprocal of zero, which should be infinity. The function is also not correctly handling the case when the complex number is zero in the subsequent conditions.": [
      "Correctly Handle Zero Complex Number\nThe function should return infinity when the complex number is zero. We can add a condition to check if the complex number is zero and return infinity immediately. This can be achieved by modifying the function as follows:\n```java\npublic Complex reciprocal() {\n    if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0) {\n        return INF;\n    }\n    // rest of the function remains the same\n}\n```\nThis solution correctly handles the case when the complex number is zero and returns infinity as expected.",
      "Simplify the Function\nWe can simplify the function by removing the unnecessary conditions and directly returning infinity when the complex number is zero. This can be achieved by modifying the function as follows:\n```java\npublic Complex reciprocal() {\n    if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0) {\n        return INF;\n    } else if (isNaN) {\n        return NaN;\n    } else if (isInfinite) {\n        return ZERO;\n    } else {\n        // rest of the function remains the same\n    }\n}\n```\nThis solution simplifies the function and correctly handles the case when the complex number is zero.",
      "Use a More Robust Approach\nWe can use a more robust approach to handle the case when the complex number is zero. For example, we can check if the magnitude of the complex number is zero and return infinity if it is. This can be achieved by modifying the function as follows:\n```java\npublic Complex reciprocal() {\n    if (FastMath.hypot(real, imaginary) == 0.0) {\n        return INF;\n    }\n    // rest of the function remains the same\n}\n```\nThis solution uses a more robust approach to handle the case when the complex number is zero and returns infinity as expected."
