    "The root cause of the bug is that the `find` function is not returning a `JsonDeserializer` for the `VoidBean` class. This is because the `VoidBean` class is not explicitly handled in the `find` function, and the default deserialization mechanism is not able to instantiate it from an integer value.": [
      "Add explicit handling for VoidBean class\nAdd a new condition to the `find` function to explicitly handle the `VoidBean` class. This could involve creating a new `JsonDeserializer` class specifically for `VoidBean`. The new condition would check if the `rawType` is `VoidBean.class` and return a new instance of the `VoidBeanDeserializer` class.\n\n```java\nif (rawType == VoidBean.class) {\n    return new VoidBeanDeserializer();\n}\n```",
      "Use a default deserializer for VoidBean class\nModify the `find` function to return a default `JsonDeserializer` for the `VoidBean` class. This could involve using a `StdDeserializer` or a `BeanDeserializer`. The default deserializer would be able to instantiate the `VoidBean` class from an integer value.\n\n```java\nif (rawType == VoidBean.class) {\n    return new StdDeserializer<VoidBean>(VoidBean.class) {\n        @Override\n        public VoidBean deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException {\n            // implement deserialization logic here\n        }\n    };\n}\n```",
      "Modify the VoidBean class to have a no-arg constructor\nModify the `VoidBean` class to have a no-arg constructor, which would allow the default deserialization mechanism to instantiate it from an integer value. This would involve adding a new constructor to the `VoidBean` class that takes no arguments.\n\n```java\npublic class VoidBean {\n    // existing code...\n\n    public VoidBean() {\n        // no-arg constructor\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEach of these solutions has its pros and cons, and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the application. However, by modifying the `find` function to return a `JsonDeserializer` that can handle the `VoidBean` class, we can fix the bug and ensure that the application works correctly."
