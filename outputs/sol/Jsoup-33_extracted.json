    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` is not correctly handling self-closing tags. Specifically, when a self-closing tag is encountered, the function is not properly formatting the tag with a closing tag. This is because the function is relying on the `isSelfClosing()` method to determine whether a tag is self-closing, but this method is not sufficient to handle all cases.": [
      "Modify the `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` function to use a more robust method to determine whether a tag is self-closing\nOne potential fix is to modify the `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` function to use a more robust method to determine whether a tag is self-closing. For example, we could use a whitelist of known self-closing tags to determine whether a tag is self-closing. This would ensure that the function correctly handles self-closing tags, even if the `isSelfClosing()` method is not sufficient.",

This would ensure that the function correctly handles self-closing tags, even if the `isSelfClosing()` method is not sufficient. However, this fix may have unintended consequences, such as adding unnecessary closing tags to non-self-closing tags.",
