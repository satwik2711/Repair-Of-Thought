    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` is not correctly handling self-closing tags. When a self-closing tag is encountered, the function calls `insertEmpty(startTag)`, which correctly inserts the self-closing tag into the document. However, the function then calls `tokeniser.emit(new Token.EndTag(el.tagName()))`, which emits an end tag for the self-closing tag, resulting in incorrect HTML output.": [
      "Remove End Tag Emission for Self-Closing Tags\nOne potential fix is to remove the emission of the end tag for self-closing tags. This can be done by modifying the `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` function to only emit the end tag for non-self-closing tags. This fix would ensure that self-closing tags are correctly handled and would result in correct HTML output.",
      "Modify InsertEmpty Function to Handle Self-Closing Tags Correctly\nAnother potential fix is to modify the `insertEmpty(Token.StartTag startTag)` function to correctly handle self-closing tags. This function could be modified to insert the self-closing tag into the document without emitting an end tag. This fix would ensure that self-closing tags are correctly handled and would result in correct HTML output.",
      "Add Special Handling for Known Self-Closing Tags\nA third potential fix is to add special handling for known self-closing tags. This could be done by modifying the `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` function to check if the tag is a known self-closing tag and handle it accordingly. This fix would ensure that known self-closing tags are correctly handled and would result in correct HTML output.\n\nThe best fix for the bug is to remove the emission of the end tag for self-closing tags. This can be done by modifying the `insert(Token.StartTag startTag)` function to only emit the end tag for non-self-closing tags. Here is the modified code:\n\n```java\nElement insert(Token.StartTag startTag) {\n    // handle empty unknown tags\n    // when the spec expects an empty tag, will directly hit insertEmpty, so won't generate this fake end tag.\n    if (startTag.isSelfClosing()) {\n        Element el = insertEmpty(startTag);\n        stack.add(el);\n        return el;\n    }\n    \n    Element el = new Element(Tag.valueOf(startTag.name()), baseUri, startTag.attributes);\n    insert(el);\n    tokeniser.emit(new Token.EndTag(el.tagName()));\n    return el;\n}\n```"
