    "The root cause of the issue is likely due to the fact that the `getRemainingJSDocLine` function is not correctly handling the case where the JSDoc comment has a syntax error. The function is simply delegating to the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine` method without any error checking or handling. This is causing the position information to be recorded incorrectly, leading to the `IllegalStateException`.": [
      "Add Error Handling\nOne potential fix is to add error handling to the `getRemainingJSDocLine` function. This could involve checking the result of the `stream.getRemainingJSDocLine` method and handling any errors that occur. For example, the function could return an empty string or throw a custom exception if an error occurs.",
      "Validate Position Information\nAnother potential fix is to validate the position information before recording it. This could involve checking that the start character position is less than or equal to the end character position, and throwing an exception if this is not the case.",
      "Handle Syntax Errors\nA third potential fix is to handle syntax errors in the JSDoc comment. This could involve parsing the comment and checking for syntax errors before attempting to record the position information. If a syntax error is found, the function could return an error message or throw a custom exception.\n\nHere is the final solution in code format:\n\n```java\nprivate String getRemainingJSDocLine() {\n  try {\n    String result = stream.getRemainingJSDocLine();\n    // Validate position information\n    if (result != null && result.length() > 0) {\n      int startCharNo = stream.getStartCharNo();\n      int endCharNo = stream.getEndCharNo();\n      if (startCharNo > endCharNo) {\n        throw new IllegalStateException(\"Recorded bad position information\");\n      }\n    }\n    return result;\n  } catch (Exception e) {\n    // Handle error\n    return \"\";\n  }\n}\n```"
