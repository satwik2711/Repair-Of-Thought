However, the entity value is a Unicode code point that represents a supplementary character, which cannot be represented by a single `char` in Java.

This method can handle supplementary characters correctly. Here's how the code can be modified:\n\n```java\nchar[] chars = Character.toChars(entityValue);\nout.write(chars);\n```\n\nSuggestion 2: Using String.valueOf() and getBytes()\nAnother possible fix is to use the `String.valueOf()` method to convert the entity value to a `String`, and then write this string to the output writer using the `getBytes()` method to get the bytes of the string. Here's how the code can be modified:\n\n```java\nString str = String.valueOf(entityValue);\nbyte[] bytes = str.getBytes();\nout.write(bytes);\n```\n\nSuggestion 3: Using StringBuilder and appendCodePoint()\nA third possible fix is to use a `StringBuilder` to build the string representation of the entity value, and then use the `appendCodePoint()` method to append the Unicode code point to the string builder. Here's how the code can be modified:\n\n```java\nStringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\nsb.appendCodePoint(entityValue);\nout.write(sb.toString());\n```",
