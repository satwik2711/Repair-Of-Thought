        "final_solution": "Root Cause: The issue seems to be related to the way the `resolveLocalFileHeaderData` method is handling the extraction of data from the local file header. Specifically, the method is not correctly calculating the offset for the data to read from the entries, resulting in a null `InputStream` when trying to read the data. This is likely due to the fact that the method is not taking into account the padding bytes that are added to the file name and extra field lengths in the local file header.\n\nSuggestion 1: Correct Offset Calculation\nOne possible fix is to correct the offset calculation in the `resolveLocalFileHeaderData` method. The current implementation calculates the offset as `offset + LFH_OFFSET_FOR_FILENAME_LENGTH + SHORT + SHORT + fileNameLen + extraFieldLen`, but this may not be accurate. A possible fix is to recalculate the offset based on the actual structure of the local file header, taking into account the padding bytes that are added to the file name and extra field lengths.\n\nSuggestion 2: Verify Data Extraction\nAnother possible fix is to verify that the data is being extracted correctly from the local file header. This can be done by adding additional logging or debugging statements to the `resolveLocalFileHeaderData` method to ensure that the data is being read correctly. This can help identify if the issue is related to the offset calculation or if there is another problem with the data extraction.\n\nSuggestion 3: Handle Edge Cases\nA third possible fix is to handle edge cases where the data may not be present in the local file header. This can be done by adding additional checks to the `resolveLocalFileHeaderData` method to handle cases where the data is missing or corrupted. This can help prevent the null `InputStream` error and ensure that the method can handle different types of input data.",
