    "The root cause of the bug is that the constructor of the PoissonDistributionImpl class throws a MathRuntimeException when the mean is less than or equal to 0, but the trigger test expects a NotStrictlyPositiveException. This discrepancy between the expected and actual exceptions is the cause of the bug.": [
      "Throw NotStrictlyPositiveException Instead of MathRuntimeException\nThe constructor of the PoissonDistributionImpl class should throw a NotStrictlyPositiveException when the mean is less than or equal to 0. This can be achieved by replacing the line `throw MathRuntimeException.createIllegalArgumentException(LocalizedFormats.NOT_POSITIVE_POISSON_MEAN, p);` with `throw new NotStrictlyPositiveException(LocalizedFormats.NOT_POSITIVE_POISSON_MEAN, p);`. This change will ensure that the constructor throws the expected exception when the mean is invalid.",
      "Use a More Specific Exception Class\nInstead of throwing a NotStrictlyPositiveException, we could create a more specific exception class, such as NegativePoissonMeanException, to handle this specific case. This would provide more information about the error and make it easier to handle. The new exception class would need to be created and the constructor would need to be modified to throw this new exception.",
      "Modify the Trigger Test to Expect MathRuntimeException\nAnother possible solution is to modify the trigger test to expect a MathRuntimeException instead of a NotStrictlyPositiveException. This would involve changing the line `catch(NotStrictlyPositiveException ex)` to `catch(MathRuntimeException ex)` in the trigger test. This change would ensure that the test passes when the constructor throws a MathRuntimeException. However, this solution may not be ideal as it does not address the underlying issue of the constructor throwing a different exception than expected."
