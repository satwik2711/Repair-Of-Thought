    "The root cause of the bug is that the createCopy method is being called with an invalid range. The method requires the start index to be less than or equal to the end index. However, in the clone method, the end index is set to getItemCount() - 1, which can be equal to the start index (0) when the time series is empty. This causes the IllegalArgumentException to be thrown.": [
      "Adjust the End Index\nAdjust the end index to be getItemCount() instead of getItemCount() - 1. This ensures that the end index is always greater than or equal to the start index. This solution is simple and efficient, and it handles the edge case where the time series is empty.",
      "Check for Empty Time Series\nCheck if the time series is empty before calling the createCopy method. If it is empty, return an empty clone or throw a custom exception. This solution is more robust and handles the edge case where the time series is empty, but it may be less efficient than Suggestion 1.",
      "Use a Different Cloning Method\nUse a different cloning method that does not rely on the createCopy method. For example, create a new time series and add all the items from the original series to the new series. This solution is more complex and may be slower than the other two suggestions, but it provides a more robust and flexible cloning mechanism."
