    "The root cause of the bug is that the getItemCount() method is returning 0 when the time series is empty, causing the end index to be -1. This is because the getItemCount() method is not checking if the time series is empty before returning the count. As a result, the createCopy method is being called with invalid indices, resulting in the IllegalArgumentException.": [
      "Check for Empty Time Series\nCheck if the time series is empty before calling the createCopy method. If the time series is empty, return an empty clone. This approach ensures that the createCopy method is not called with invalid indices, preventing the IllegalArgumentException.\n\n```java\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    if (getItemCount() == 0) {\n        return new TimeSeries(\"Series\");\n    }\n    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);\n    return clone;\n}\n```",
      "Handle Edge Case in getItemCount Method\nModify the getItemCount method to return 1 when the time series is empty, instead of 0. This will ensure that the end index is not -1 when the time series is empty, preventing the IllegalArgumentException.\n\n```java\npublic int getItemCount() {\n    if (items.isEmpty()) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return items.size();\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Approach to Clone the Time Series\nInstead of using the createCopy method, use a different approach to clone the time series, such as creating a new time series and adding all the data points from the original series to the new series. This approach avoids the issue of invalid indices altogether.\n\n```java\npublic Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    TimeSeries clone = new TimeSeries(\"Series\");\n    for (int i = 0; i < getItemCount(); i++) {\n        clone.add(getItem(i));\n    }\n    return clone;\n}\n```"
