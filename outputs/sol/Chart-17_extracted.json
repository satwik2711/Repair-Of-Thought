    "The root cause of the bug is that the clone() function does not check if the time series is empty before calling the createCopy() function. When the time series is empty, getItemCount() returns 0, and the end index becomes -1, which is less than the start index 0. This causes the createCopy() function to throw an IllegalArgumentException with the message 'Requires start <= end.'": [
      "Check for Empty Time Series\nCheck if the time series is empty before calling the createCopy() function. If it's empty, return a new empty TimeSeries object. This can be achieved by adding a simple if condition at the beginning of the clone() function to check if getItemCount() is 0. If it is, return a new TimeSeries object with the same name as the original series.",
      "Handle Edge Case in createCopy()\nModify the createCopy() function to handle the edge case when the start index is greater than the end index. Instead of throwing an exception, the function could return an empty TimeSeries object or handle it according to the requirements. This would prevent the IllegalArgumentException from being thrown and provide a more robust solution.",
      "Return Early for Empty Time Series\nReturn immediately from the clone() function if the time series is empty, without calling the createCopy() function. This can be done by adding a conditional statement at the beginning of the clone() function to check if getItemCount() is 0. If it is, return a new TimeSeries object or handle it according to the requirements, thus avoiding the call to createCopy() and preventing the exception from being thrown."
