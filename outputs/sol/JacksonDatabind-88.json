However, this approach may require significant changes to the existing code and may not be the most efficient solution.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Different Type Construction Method\nAnother possible fix is to use a different method to construct the type, such as `constructSpecializedType`.

This approach is more straightforward and may be more efficient than modifying the `constructFromCanonical` method.\n\nSuggestion 3: Add a New Method to Handle Nested Types\nA third possible fix is to add a new method to the `TypeFactory` class that is specifically designed to handle nested types. This method could be used by the `_typeFromId` function to construct the type correctly. This approach would allow us to keep the existing code intact and add a new method to handle the specific case of nested types.
