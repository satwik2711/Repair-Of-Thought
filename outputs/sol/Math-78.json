        "final_solution": "Root Cause: The root cause of the bug is that the BrentSolver class is not able to find the root of the switching function when the time interval is too small. This is because the BrentSolver class uses a bisection method to find the root, which requires the function to have opposite signs at the two ends of the interval. However, when the time interval is too small, the function may not have opposite signs at the two ends, causing the BrentSolver class to throw an exception.\n\nSuggestion 1: Increase the Time Interval\nOne possible fix is to increase the time interval used in the evaluateStep method. This can be done by increasing the value of the maxCheckInterval variable, which determines the maximum time interval used in the method. By increasing the time interval, we can ensure that the BrentSolver class has enough room to find the root of the switching function. This can be achieved by modifying the line where the maxCheckInterval variable is defined, for example:\n```java\nprivate static final double maxCheckInterval = 1e-3; // increase this value\n```\nThis will increase the time interval used in the evaluateStep method, allowing the BrentSolver class to find the root of the switching function.\n\nSuggestion 2: Use a Different Root Finding Method\nAnother possible fix is to use a different root finding method that is more robust than the bisection method used by the BrentSolver class. For example, we could use a secant method or a Newton-Raphson method, which are more robust and can handle smaller time intervals. This can be achieved by replacing the BrentSolver class with a different root finding class, for example:\n```java\nfinal SecantSolver solver = new SecantSolver();\n```\nThis will use a secant method to find the root of the switching function, which is more robust than the bisection method used by the BrentSolver class.\n\nSuggestion 3: Check for Opposite Signs\nA third possible fix is to check if the switching function has opposite signs at the two ends of the time interval before calling the BrentSolver class. If the function does not have opposite signs, we can either increase the time interval or use a different root finding method. This can be achieved by adding a check before calling the BrentSolver class, for example:\n```java\nif (f.value(ta) * f.value(tb) < 0) {\n    // function has opposite signs, use BrentSolver\n    final double root = (ta <= tb) ? solver.solve(f, ta, tb) : solver.solve(f, tb, ta);\n} else {\n    // function does not have opposite signs, increase time interval or use different root finding method\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis will check if the switching function has opposite signs at the two ends of the time interval before calling the BrentSolver class, and will use a different approach if the function does not have opposite signs.",
