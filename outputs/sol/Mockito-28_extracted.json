    "The root cause of the bug is that the `injectMockCandidate` function is not correctly filtering the mock candidates based on the field type. The function is using the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method to filter the mock candidates, but this method is not correctly implemented to prioritize exact type matches over ancestor type matches. As a result, the mock injection is not happening correctly, leading to the `AssertionFailedError`.": [
      "Prioritize Exact Type Matches\nModify the `mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` method to prioritize exact type matches over ancestor type matches. This can be done by checking if the field type is an exact match with the mock candidate type before checking for ancestor type matches. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(mocks, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Use a More Specific Filter\nModify the `injectMockCandidate` function to use a more specific filter that takes into account the field type and the mock candidate type. This can be done by creating a new filter method that checks for exact type matches and ancestor type matches separately. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    for(Field field : orderedInstanceFieldsFrom(awaitingInjectionClazz)) {\n        if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(mocks, field, fieldInstance) || \n            mockCandidateFilter.isAncestorTypeMatch(mocks, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mocks, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Reorder the Mock Candidates\nModify the `injectMockCandidate` function to reorder the mock candidates based on their type matches. This can be done by sorting the mock candidates based on their type matches, with exact type matches coming first. The corrected code would be:\n```java\nprivate void injectMockCandidate(Class<?> awaitingInjectionClazz, Set<Object> mocks, Object fieldInstance) {\n    List<Object> sortedMocks = new ArrayList<>(mocks);\n    Collections.sort(sortedMocks, (o1, o2) -> {\n        if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(o1, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            return -1;\n        } else if (mockCandidateFilter.isExactTypeMatch(o2, field, fieldInstance)) {\n            return 1;\n        } else {\n            return 0;\n        }\n    });\n    for(Object mock : sortedMocks) {\n        mockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(mock, field, fieldInstance).thenInject();\n    }\n}\n```"
