    "The root cause of this bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the two input vectors are nearly parallel. In such cases, the cross-product should be close to zero, but the function is returning a non-zero value due to numerical instability. This is because the function is not using the preconditioning technique correctly, which is intended to reduce cancellation errors. Specifically, the function is not computing the value of rho, which is used to rescale the vectors before computing the cross-product.": [
      "Implement Preconditioning Technique\nWe can fix this bug by implementing the preconditioning technique correctly. We need to compute the value of rho, which is used to rescale the vectors before computing the cross-product. We can do this by adding the following lines of code before computing the cross-product:\ndouble rho = (v1.dotProduct(v2)) / (v2.dotProduct(v2));\nVector3D v3 = v1.subtract(v2.multiply(rho));\nThen, we can compute the cross-product using v3 and v2 instead of v1 and v2.",
      "Use a More Robust Method\nAnother way to fix this bug is to use a more robust method for computing the cross-product. We can use the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize the two input vectors before computing the cross-product. This method is more robust and can handle cases where the two input vectors are nearly parallel.",
      "Check for Parallel Vectors\nWe can also fix this bug by checking if the two input vectors are parallel before computing the cross-product. If the vectors are parallel, we can return a zero vector instead of attempting to compute the cross-product. We can do this by adding a simple check at the beginning of the function:\nif (v1.dotProduct(v2) == v1.dotProduct(v1)) {\n    return new Vector3D(0, 0, 0);\n}"
