    "The root cause of the bug is that the function `getNextZipEntry()` is not correctly handling nested archives. When it encounters a nested archive, it is not throwing a `ZipException` as expected. This is because the function is not checking if the current entry is a nested archive before trying to read it.": [
      "Check for Nested Archives Before Reading\n----------------------------------------------------\nWe can modify the function `getNextZipEntry()` to check if the current entry is a nested archive before trying to read it. If it is a nested archive, we can throw a `ZipException` as expected. This can be done by adding a simple check before reading the entry:\n```java\nif (current.entry.getMethod() == ZipMethod.NESTED.getCode()) {\n    throw new ZipException(\"Nested archives are not supported\");\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the function correctly handles nested archives and throws an exception when it encounters one.",
      "Handle Nested Archives Correctly\n------------------------------------------\nWe can modify the function `getNextZipEntry()` to handle nested archives correctly. If the current entry is a nested archive, we can create a new `ArchiveInputStream` to read the nested archive. This can be done by adding a new block of code to handle nested archives:\n```java\nif (current.entry.getMethod() == ZipMethod.NESTED.getCode()) {\n    ArchiveInputStream nestedIn = new ArchiveStreamFactory().createArchiveInputStream(\"zip\", in);\n    // Read the nested archive\n}\n```\nThis will allow the function to correctly handle nested archives and read their contents.",
      "Improve Error Handling\n---------------------------------\nWe can improve the error handling in the function `getNextZipEntry()` to handle cases where the nested archive is corrupted or invalid. This can be done by wrapping the code that reads the nested archive in a try-catch block:\n```java\ntry {\n    // Read the nested archive\n} catch (ZipException e) {\n    throw new ZipException(\"Error reading nested archive\", e);\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that the function correctly handles errors when reading nested archives and provides a meaningful error message."
