    "The issue lies in the fact that the function is not correctly handling the case where the product of `val1` and `val2` is outside the range of `long`. The current implementation checks for overflow by verifying if `total / val2 != val1`, but this approach is flawed. When `val1` is `Long.MIN_VALUE` and `val2` is `-1`, the product is `Long.MAX_VALUE + 1`, which is outside the range of `long`. However, the check `total / val2 != val1` passes because `total` is `Long.MIN_VALUE` and `val2` is `-1`, resulting in `Long.MAX_VALUE` when divided, which is not equal to `val1`. This incorrect handling of the edge case leads to the assertion failure.": [
      "Check for Overflow Before Multiplication\nInstead of checking for overflow after the multiplication, we can check if the product would overflow before performing the multiplication. We can do this by verifying if `val1` is `Long.MIN_VALUE` and `val2` is less than `-1`, or if `val1` is `Long.MAX_VALUE` and `val2` is greater than `1`. If either condition is true, we can throw an `ArithmeticException` immediately.",
      "Use a Wider Data Type for Intermediate Results\nWe can use a wider data type, such as `BigInteger`, to store the intermediate result of the multiplication. This would allow us to correctly handle the case where the product is outside the range of `long`. We can then check if the result can be represented as a `long` and throw an `ArithmeticException` if it cannot.",
      "Check for Overflow Using a Different Approach\nWe can use a different approach to check for overflow, such as verifying if the product would exceed `Long.MAX_VALUE` or be less than `Long.MIN_VALUE`. We can do this by checking if `val1` is greater than `Long.MAX_VALUE / val2` or less than `Long.MIN_VALUE / val2`. If either condition is true, we can throw an `ArithmeticException` immediately.\", \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"}"
