    "The issue lies in the `isPrototypePropertyAssign` function. It checks if the first child of the assignment node is a `GETPROP` node and if its first child's next sibling is a `STRING` node with the value 'prototype'. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for cases where the `GETPROP` node has more than one child, or where the `STRING` node is not the immediate next sibling of the first child. In the trigger test, the `GETPROP` node has two children: `e.prototype` and `method1`, and the `STRING` node 'prototype' is not the immediate next sibling of the first child.": [
      "Check for 'prototype' in all children\nWe can modify the function to check all children of the `GETPROP` node, not just the first child's next sibling. This can be done by iterating over all children of the `GETPROP` node and checking if any of them are a `STRING` node with the value 'prototype'. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean isPrototypePropertyAssign(Node assign) {\n  Node n = assign.getFirstChild();\n  if (n != null && NodeUtil.isVarOrSimpleAssignLhs(n, assign)\n      && n.getType() == Token.GETPROP\n      ) {\n    // Check all children of the GETPROP node\n    for (Node child = n.getFirstChild(); child != null; child = child.getNext()) {\n      if (child.getType() == Token.STRING && child.getString().equals(\"prototype\")) {\n        return true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n```",
      "Use a more robust way to identify prototype property assignment\nInstead of relying on the specific structure of the `GETPROP` node, we can use a more robust way to identify prototype property assignment. For example, we can check if the `GETPROP` node has a `STRING` child with the value 'prototype' anywhere in its subtree. This can be done by recursively traversing the subtree of the `GETPROP` node and checking for the 'prototype' string.",
      "Check for 'prototype' in the assignment's left-hand side\nWe can modify the function to check if the left-hand side of the assignment is a `GETPROP` node with a `STRING` child with the value 'prototype'. This can be done by checking the type of the assignment's left-hand side and then checking its children. Here is the modified code:\n```java\nprivate boolean isPrototypePropertyAssign(Node assign) {\n  Node n = assign.getFirstChild();\n  if (n != null && NodeUtil.isVarOrSimpleAssignLhs(n, assign)\n      && n.getType() == Token.GETPROP\n      ) {\n    // Check the left-hand side of the assignment\n    Node lhs = assign.getLeftHandSide();\n    if (lhs.getType() == Token.GETPROP) {\n      for (Node child = lhs.getFirstChild(); child != null; child = child.getNext()) {\n        if (child.getType() == Token.STRING && child.getString().equals(\"prototype\")) {\n          return true;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n```"
