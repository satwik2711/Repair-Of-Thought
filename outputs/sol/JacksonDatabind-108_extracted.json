    "The root cause of the bug is that the `_bindAsTree` method is returning a `MissingNode` when the input is empty, instead of `null`. This is because the `_bindAsTree` method is not checking for the end-of-input condition and is returning a `MissingNode` by default.": [
      "Check for End-of-Input Condition\nWe can add a check for the end-of-input condition in the `readTree` method. If the input is empty, we can return `null` immediately. Otherwise, we can call the `_bindAsTree` method as before. This solution is simple and effective, and it fixes the bug without introducing any new issues.\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n    if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.END_OF_INPUT) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    return (T) _bindAsTree(p);\n}\n```",
      "Modify _bindAsTree Method\nWe can modify the `_bindAsTree` method to return `null` when the input is empty. This would require adding a check for the end-of-input condition in the `_bindAsTree` method. However, this solution may be more complex and may require additional changes to the `_bindAsTree` method.\n\n```java\nprivate <T extends TreeNode> T _bindAsTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n    if (p.getCurrentToken() == JsonToken.END_OF_INPUT) {\n        return null;\n    }\n    // existing code\n}\n```",
      "Use a Different Method\nWe can use a different method to bind the content as a JSON tree. For example, we can use the `readValue` method with a `JsonNode` type parameter. This would allow us to avoid the issue with the `_bindAsTree` method. However, this solution may require additional changes to the surrounding code and may not be as efficient as the other solutions.\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic <T extends TreeNode> T readTree(JsonParser p) throws IOException {\n    return (T) MAPPER.readTree(p);\n}\n```"
