    "The root cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the case when the lower limit is greater than the length of the string. In this case, the function tries to access an index of the string that is out of range, resulting in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is because the function does not check if the lower limit is greater than the length of the string before trying to access the string at that index.": [
      "Check Lower Limit Before Accessing String\nOne potential fix is to add a check before accessing the string at the lower limit index. We can add a simple if statement to check if the lower limit is greater than the length of the string, and if so, return the original string or an empty string, depending on the desired behavior. This would prevent the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` from being thrown. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (lower > str.length()) {\n    return str;\n}\n```\nThis fix is simple and effective, but it may not be the desired behavior in all cases.",
      "Adjust Lower Limit to Be Within String Bounds\nAnother potential fix is to adjust the lower limit to be within the bounds of the string. We can add a simple if statement to check if the lower limit is greater than the length of the string, and if so, set the lower limit to the length of the string. This would prevent the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` from being thrown and would also ensure that the function behaves correctly even when the lower limit is greater than the length of the string. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (lower > str.length()) {\n    lower = str.length();\n}\n```\nThis fix is also simple and effective, and it ensures that the function behaves correctly in all cases.",
      "Throw Custom Exception\nA third potential fix is to throw a custom exception when the lower limit is greater than the length of the string. We can create a custom exception class and throw an instance of it when the lower limit is greater than the length of the string. This would allow the caller to handle the exception and decide what to do in this case. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (lower > str.length()) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Lower limit cannot be greater than string length\");\n}\n```\nThis fix is more robust and allows the caller to handle the exception, but it may require additional error handling code."
