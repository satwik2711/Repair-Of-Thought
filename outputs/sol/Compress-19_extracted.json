    "The root cause of this bug is that the function `reparseCentralDirectoryData` does not correctly handle the case where the raw central directory data contains excess data beyond what is expected. The function only checks if the length of the raw data matches the expected length, but it does not account for the possibility of extra data being present. This extra data causes the function to throw a `ZipException`.": [
      "Ignore Excess Data\nOne possible fix is to modify the function to ignore any excess data beyond what is expected. We can do this by changing the condition that checks the length of the raw data to only check if the length is greater than or equal to the expected length. This will allow the function to correctly parse the data even if there is excess data present. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\nif (rawCentralDirectoryData.length >= expectedLength) {\n    // process the data\n} else {\n    throw new ZipException(\"central directory zip64 extended information extra field's length doesn't match central directory data.\");\n}\n```",
      "Truncate Excess Data\nAnother possible fix is to modify the function to truncate any excess data beyond what is expected. We can do this by creating a new byte array that is the expected length and copying the raw data into it. This will ensure that the function only processes the expected data and ignores any excess data. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\nif (rawCentralDirectoryData.length > expectedLength) {\n    byte[] truncatedData = new byte[expectedLength];\n    System.arraycopy(rawCentralDirectoryData, 0, truncatedData, 0, expectedLength);\n    rawCentralDirectoryData = truncatedData;\n}\n// process the data\n```",
      "Throw a Warning\nA third possible fix is to modify the function to throw a warning instead of an exception when excess data is present. This will allow the function to continue processing the data, but will also alert the user to the presence of excess data. The modified function would look like this:\n```java\nif (rawCentralDirectoryData.length > expectedLength) {\n    System.err.println(\"Warning: excess data found in central directory zip64 extended information extra field.\");\n}\n// process the data\n```"
