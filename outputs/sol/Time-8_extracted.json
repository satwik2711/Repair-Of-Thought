    "The root cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case when the hours are zero and the minutes are negative. The function checks if the minutes are negative, but it does not consider the case when the hours are zero. This causes the function to throw an IllegalArgumentException when the minutes are negative, even though the resulting offset is within the valid range.": [
      "Modify Minutes Offset Check\nWe can modify the minutes offset check to consider the case when the hours are zero. We can add a conditional statement to check if the hours are zero before throwing the IllegalArgumentException. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (hoursOffset != 0 && minutesOffset < 0) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Minutes out of range: \" + minutesOffset);\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that the function does not throw an exception when the hours are zero and the minutes are negative.",
      "Use Absolute Value for Minutes Offset\nWe can use the absolute value of the minutes offset to avoid the issue of negative minutes when the hours are zero. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nminutesOffset = Math.abs(minutesOffset);\n```\nThis modification will ensure that the minutes offset is always positive, and the function will not throw an exception when the hours are zero and the minutes are negative.",
      "Modify Offset Calculation\nWe can modify the offset calculation to correctly handle the case when the hours are zero and the minutes are negative. We can add a conditional statement to check if the hours are zero before calculating the offset. Here's the modified code:\n```java\nif (hoursOffset == 0) {\n    offset = FieldUtils.safeMultiply(minutesOffset, DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_MINUTE);\n} else {\n    int hoursInMinutes = hoursOffset * 60;\n    if (hoursInMinutes < 0) {\n        minutesOffset = hoursInMinutes - minutesOffset;\n    } else {\n        minutesOffset = hoursInMinutes + minutesOffset;\n    }\n    offset = FieldUtils.safeMultiply(minutesOffset, DateTimeConstants.MILLIS_PER_MINUTE);\n}\n```\nThis modification will ensure that the offset is calculated correctly when the hours are zero and the minutes are negative."
