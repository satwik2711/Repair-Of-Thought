    "The root cause of the bug is that the mix-in methods are not being properly added to the `AnnotatedMethodMap` when the class has a mix-in annotation. This is because the `_addMethodMixIns` function is not correctly handling the case where a mix-in method is overridden by a method in the class itself.": [
      "Modify _addMethodMixIns to Handle Overridden Mix-in Methods\nOne potential fix is to modify the `_addMethodMixIns` function to check if a mix-in method is overridden by a method in the class itself. If it is, we should add the overridden method to the `AnnotatedMethodMap` instead of the mix-in method. This can be done by adding a check for overridden methods in the `_addMethodMixIns` function.\n\n```java\nprotected void _addMethodMixIns(Class<?> targetClass, AnnotatedMethodMap methods,\n        Class<?> mixInCls, AnnotatedMethodMap mixIns)\n{\n    List<Class<?>> parents = new ArrayList<Class<?>>();\n    parents.add(mixInCls);\n    ClassUtil.findSuperTypes(mixInCls, targetClass, parents);\n    for (Class<?> mixin : parents) {\n        for (Method m : mixin.getDeclaredMethods()) {\n            if (!_isIncludableMemberMethod(m)) {\n                continue;\n            }\n            AnnotatedMethod am = methods.find(m);\n            if (am != null) {\n                // Check if the mix-in method is overridden by a method in the class itself\n                Method overriddenMethod = targetClass.getDeclaredMethod(m.getName(), m.getParameterTypes());\n                if (overriddenMethod != null) {\n                    // Add the overridden method to the AnnotatedMethodMap instead of the mix-in method\n                    _addMixUnders(overriddenMethod, am);\n                } else {\n                    _addMixUnders(m, am);\n                }\n            } else {\n                mixIns.add(_constructMethod(m));\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",
      "Modify _addMemberMethods to Handle Mix-in Methods Correctly\nAnother potential fix is to modify the `_addMemberMethods` function to correctly handle mix-in methods.
