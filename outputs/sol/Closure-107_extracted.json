    "The root cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of the `@desc` annotation in the `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS` compilation level. In this level, the compiler is expected to inline the `goog.getMsg` function, but it seems that the annotation is not being handled correctly, resulting in errors or warnings.": [
      "Ignore @desc Annotations in ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS\nOne possible fix is to ignore the `@desc` annotations when the compilation level is set to `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS`. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to check the compilation level before processing the annotations. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (CompilationLevel.ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS == level) {\n    // In ADVANCED mode, ignore @desc annotations\n    options.ignoreAnnotations = true;\n}\n```\nThis code adds a new flag `ignoreAnnotations` to the `CompilerOptions` object and sets it to `true` when the compilation level is set to `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS`. This flag can then be used to ignore the `@desc` annotations during the compilation process.",
      "Modify the EmptyMessageBundle\nAnother possible fix is to modify the `EmptyMessageBundle` class to handle the `@desc` annotations correctly. This can be done by adding a method to the class that processes the annotations and returns an empty message bundle. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (CompilationLevel.ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS == level) {\n    // In ADVANCED mode, use a modified EmptyMessageBundle\n    options.messageBundle = new ModifiedEmptyMessageBundle();\n}\n```\nThis code creates a new class `ModifiedEmptyMessageBundle` that extends the `EmptyMessageBundle` class and adds a method to process the `@desc` annotations.",
      "Add a Flag to Disable Annotation Processing\nA third possible fix is to add a flag to disable the processing of annotations in the `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS` compilation level. This can be done by adding a new flag to the `flags` object and checking it before processing the annotations. The modified code would look like this:\n```java\nif (flags.disableAnnotationProcessing && CompilationLevel.ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS == level) {\n    // In ADVANCED mode, disable annotation processing\n    options.ignoreAnnotations = true;\n}\n```\nThis code adds a new flag `disableAnnotationProcessing` to the `flags` object and checks it before processing the annotations. If the flag is set to `true`, the annotations are ignored during the compilation process."
