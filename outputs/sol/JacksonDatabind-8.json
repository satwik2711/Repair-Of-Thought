This is causing the function to throw an exception when it should not.\n\nSuggestion 1: Relaxing the Class Check\nThe `verifyNonDup` function can be modified to relax the class check. Instead of checking if the new creator has the same class as the old creator, we can check if the new creator is a subclass of the old creator. This would allow the function to correctly handle the case where the new creator has the same class as the old creator, but is not explicitly marked. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (oldOne.getClass().isAssignableFrom(newOne.getClass())) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis change would prevent the function from throwing an exception when it encounters a non-explicit creator that has the same class as an existing explicit creator.\n\nSuggestion 2: Ignoring Non-Explicit Creators\nAnother possible fix is to ignore non-explicit creators when checking for duplicates. This would prevent the function from throwing an exception when it encounters a non-explicit creator that has the same class as an existing explicit creator. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (oldOne != null && !explicit) {\n    return;\n}\n```\nThis change would allow the function to skip the duplicate check when the new creator is not explicitly marked.\n\nSuggestion 3: Using a Different Creator Selection Strategy\nA third possible fix is to use a different creator selection strategy. Instead of always using the first creator that is found, we can use a strategy that selects the most specific creator. This would prevent the function from throwing an exception when it encounters multiple creators with the same class. The modified code would be:\n```java\nif (oldOne != null) {\n    if (oldOne.getClass().isAssignableFrom(newOne.getClass())) {\n        // use the most specific creator\n        _creators[typeIndex] = newOne;\n    } else {\n        // use the first creator\n        _creators[typeIndex] = oldOne;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis change would allow the function to select the most specific creator when there are multiple creators with the same class.",
