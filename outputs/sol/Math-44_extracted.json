    "The issue arises from the fact that the `acceptStep` function does not properly handle the case where an event occurs at a time that is very close to the end of the step. In this case, the event is triggered, but the interpolator is not properly updated, leading to a situation where the event state is evaluated at a time that is earlier than the previous time, causing the error message.": [
      "Update the Interpolator After Handling Events\nOne possible fix is to update the interpolator after handling events. This would ensure that the interpolator is always in a consistent state, even if an event occurs at a time that is very close to the end of the step. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\n// ...\n\nwhile (!occuringEvents.isEmpty()) {\n\n    // handle the chronologically first event\n    final Iterator<EventState> iterator = occuringEvents.iterator();\n    final EventState currentEvent = iterator.next();\n    iterator.remove();\n\n    // restrict the interpolator to the first part of the step, up to the event\n    final double eventT = currentEvent.getEventTime();\n    interpolator.setSoftPreviousTime(previousT);\n    interpolator.setSoftCurrentTime(eventT);\n\n    // trigger the event\n    interpolator.setInterpolatedTime(eventT);\n    final double[] eventY = interpolator.getInterpolatedState();\n    currentEvent.stepAccepted(eventT, eventY);\n    isLastStep = currentEvent.stop();\n\n    // update the interpolator after handling the event\n    interpolator.update();\n\n    // ...\n}\n```",
      "Check for Events at the End of the Step\nAnother possible fix is to add a check at the beginning of the `acceptStep` function to see if any events occur at the end of the step. If an event occurs at the end of the step, we can handle it immediately and return the end time of the step. This would prevent the event state from being evaluated at a time that is earlier than the previous time. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\n// ...\n\n// check if any events occur at the end of the step\nfor (final EventState state : eventsStates) {\n    if (state.evaluateStep(interpolator) && Precision.equals(state.getEventTime(), currentT, 1)) {\n        // handle the event immediately and return the end time of the step\n        state.stepAccepted(currentT, interpolator.getInterpolatedState());\n        return currentT;\n    }\n}\n\n// ...\n```",
      "Use a Tolerance When Evaluating Event States\nA third possible fix is to use a tolerance when evaluating event states. This would prevent the event state from being evaluated at a time that is slightly earlier than the previous time, which could cause the error message. The updated code would look like this:\n```java\n// ...\n\n// use a tolerance when evaluating event states\nfor (final EventState state : eventsStates) {\n    if (state.evaluateStep(interpolator) && state.getEventTime() >= previousT - 1e-10) {\n        // the event occurs during the current step\n        occuringEvents.add(state);\n    }\n}\n\n// ...\n```"
