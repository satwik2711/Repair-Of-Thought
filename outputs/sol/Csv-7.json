        "reasoning_steps": "Step 1: Analyzing Bug Context\nFirst, let's understand the buggy function and its intended behavior. The function `initializeHeader` is supposed to initialize the name to index mapping if the format defines a header. It returns null if the format has no header. The trigger test `testDuplicateHeaderEntries` is testing the scenario where there are duplicate header entries. The error message indicates that an `AssertionFailedError` is thrown, which means the test is expecting an `IllegalStateException` but it's not being thrown.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Root Cause\nRoot Cause: The root cause of the bug is that the function `initializeHeader` does not handle duplicate header entries correctly. When there are duplicate header entries, the function will overwrite the previous index mapping with the new one, which can lead to incorrect results. The function should throw an `IllegalStateException` when it encounters duplicate header entries, but it's not doing so.\n\nStep 3: Response\n{\"title\": \"Exploring Potential Fixes\", \"content\": \"Now that we have identified the root cause of the bug, let's explore some potential fixes.
