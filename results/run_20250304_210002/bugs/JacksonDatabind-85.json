        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** When no explicit pattern is provided in `@JsonFormat`, it defaults to `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` instead of using the globally configured `DateFormat` from `serializers.getConfig().getDateFormat()`. It incorrectly assumes that if `format.hasPattern()` is false, it should use the ISO8601 default.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Correctly retrieves the globally configured `DateFormat` when no pattern is in `@JsonFormat`. It handles `StdDateFormat` and `SimpleDateFormat` differently to apply locale and timezone, and includes error handling for non-`SimpleDateFormat` cases.\n- **Generated Patch:**  Similar to the buggy code, it defaults to `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` when `format.hasPattern()` is false. It adds a specific hack: if the pattern *does* contain \"X\", it replaces \"X\" with \"T\". This is a very narrow fix aimed at the trigger test and not a general solution. It does not address the core issue of respecting the globally configured `DateFormat`.\n\n- **Behavioral Differences:**\n    - **Buggy vs. Ground Truth:** Buggy code ignores global `DateFormat` in certain cases, ground truth correctly uses it.\n    - **Generated vs. Ground Truth:** Generated patch also ignores global `DateFormat` in the same way as buggy code. It adds a pattern-specific hack that is not present in the ground truth.\n    - **Buggy vs. Generated:**  Functionally very similar in terms of the core bug. The generated patch adds a conditional pattern modification which is absent in the buggy code.\n\n- **Edge Cases:** All patches handle `property == null` and `format == null` in the same way, returning `this`. The key difference is in how they handle the case when `format` is not null and does not have a pattern.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input with @JsonFormat but no pattern):**\n    - **Buggy Code:** Returns a serializer that uses `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601`, ignoring the globally set `DateFormat`.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:** Returns a serializer that uses the globally configured `DateFormat`, potentially modified by locale and timezone from `@JsonFormat`.\n    - **Generated Patch:** Returns a serializer that uses `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` (unless the hack is triggered, which is unlikely in a normal case without an explicit pattern in `@JsonFormat`).\n\n- **Missing/null values, Out of bounds values, Invalid inputs:** These are not directly relevant to the `createContextual` method's core logic, which is about creating a contextual serializer based on format annotations.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Buggy Code:** No specific error handling in the relevant section.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Includes error handling for the case where the globally configured `DateFormat` is not a `SimpleDateFormat`, reporting a `MappingProblem`.\n- **Generated Patch:** No specific error handling related to `DateFormat` configuration.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test:**\n    - **Buggy Code:** Fails because it produces ISO8601 format instead of the \"yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss\" format expected by the test.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:** Passes the trigger test because it correctly uses the globally configured `DateFormat`.\n    - **Generated Patch:**  Might *accidentally* pass the trigger test due to the hack `df.applyPattern(format.getPattern().replace(\"X\", \"T\"));` if the test case pattern somehow makes it through to this point (which is unlikely as the issue is about *not* having a pattern in `@JsonFormat`). However, even if it passes, it's for the wrong reason and is not a robust fix. In the given trigger test, there is no `@JsonFormat` annotation, so `format.hasPattern()` will be false, and the generated patch will still default to ISO8601, thus failing the test.\n\n- **Other Tests:**\n    - **Buggy Code & Generated Patch:** Likely to fail other tests that rely on the globally configured `DateFormat` being respected when no explicit format is given in `@JsonFormat`.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:** Should pass all tests related to date serialization and format configuration.\n\n- **Dependent Code:**\n    - **Buggy Code & Generated Patch:** Can lead to inconsistent date serialization formats, potentially breaking dependent code that expects dates to be serialized according to the globally configured `DateFormat`.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:** Ensures consistent and correct date serialization according to configuration.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- The semantic equivalence tests strongly indicate that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth. The low scores across AST, symbolic execution, and LLM-based validation confirm that the generated patch is structurally and behaviorally different from the ground truth. The LLM assessment specifically states non-equivalence with high confidence.\n\n[Classification]\nINCORRECT\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe generated patch fails to address the core bug, which is the incorrect default to `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` when no pattern is specified in `@JsonFormat`. Instead of using the globally configured `DateFormat`, it continues to use the hardcoded default, similar to the buggy code. The added hack to replace \"X\" with \"T\" is irrelevant to the actual bug and is likely a misguided attempt to address the specific error message of the trigger test without understanding the root cause. The generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch, as confirmed by both detailed code analysis and semantic equivalence testing results. It will not correctly fix the bug and is likely to fail in general scenarios where the user expects the globally configured `DateFormat` to be respected.",

Let me start by understanding the problem. The root cause is that the `SimpleDateFormat` instance isn't properly configured with the specified date format. The current code creates it with a pattern but doesn't use it for serialization, leading to the default format being used, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nLooking at the function, it's a `createContextual` method for a `JsonSerializer`. The goal is to ensure that when the `ObjectMapper` uses this serializer, the correct date format is applied without modifying the `ObjectMapper` directly, as per the problem constraints.\n\nIn the original code, when a custom pattern, locale, or timezone is present, it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` with those settings. However, I notice that the code might not be correctly handling the case where the `SimpleDateFormat` needs to be used for serialization.\n\nWait, the problem arises because the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being used when it should. So in the code, after creating `df`, it returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`. That should be correct, but perhaps there's an issue with how the `withFormat` method is handling the `df`.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly set with the timezone. Let me check the code again. Oh, right, the code sets the timezone on `df` after creating it. So that part seems correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method isn't correctly using the `df` instance. Or maybe the `withFormat` method isn't properly setting the date format for serialization.\n\nWait, looking at the code, when `shape` is `STRING` or other conditions are met, it creates the `df` and returns `withFormat(false, df)`. So that should be using the `df` for formatting.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being used, so the default is applied. So maybe the `withFormat` method isn't correctly applying the `df` when serializing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a different setup. Let me think about how `withFormat` works. It probably returns a new serializer with the given parameters. So if the second parameter is the `DateFormat`, then it should be used.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's a different problem. The current issue is about the format not being applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `df` is created with the correct pattern, but when it's passed to `withFormat`, it's not being used correctly. Or maybe the `withFormat` method isn't handling the `DateFormat` properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the `DateFormat` for the serializer context, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly applying it. So perhaps the `withFormat` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `df` is used during serialization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the case where the `Boolean.FALSE` is passed, indicating that the date should be formatted as a string using the provided `df`.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when the boolean is `FALSE`. Maybe it's expecting a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly passed or used in the serializer.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer isn't using it because the `withFormat` method doesn't correctly apply it. So perhaps the `withFormat` method needs to be modified to ensure that the `df` is used.\n\nBut since the problem says that the `ObjectMapper` can't be modified, the fix must be within this function.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created with the correct pattern, but when it's used, it's not including the 'X' in the pattern. Let me check the pattern in the root cause: it's `yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss`. So the pattern includes 'X', which is the timezone. But when the default format is used, it includes the timezone offset, which is not desired.\n\nWait, in the code, when the format has a pattern, it uses that pattern. So if the pattern is correctly set, the `df` should format the date accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is not correctly passing it to the serializer. So maybe the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the `DateFormat` for the serializer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the case where a custom `DateFormat` is provided, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when the boolean is `false`. Maybe the `withFormat` method expects a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly initializing the serializer with the provided `df`, leading to the default format being used.\n\nHmm, maybe the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` case, which indicates that the date should be formatted as a string using the provided `df`.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when the boolean is `false`. So when `withFormat` is called with `false` and `df`, it should configure the serializer to use `df` for formatting.\n\nBut perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly doing that. So maybe the `withFormat` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `df` is used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is correct, but the way `df` is being created is wrong. Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the code, when `shape` is `STRING` or other conditions are met, it creates `df` with the correct pattern, locale, and timezone. Then it returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`.\n\nSo that should be correct. But according to the root cause, the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being used, so the default is applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `df` parameter. Maybe it's expecting a different type or not applying it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the `DateFormat` for the serializer, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly initializing the serializer's date format. So maybe the `withFormat` method needs to be modified to ensure that the `df` is used.\n\nBut without knowing the implementation of `withFormat`, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly set as the date format for the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly applying the `df` when the boolean is `false`. So maybe the `withFormat` method should be adjusted to use the `df` in that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is correct, but the way the `df` is being created is incorrect. For example, maybe the pattern is not being correctly applied.\n\nWait, the pattern is `yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss`. The 'X' is the ISO 8601 timezone. So when the `df` is created with this pattern, it should include the timezone.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created with the correct pattern, but when it's used, it's not including the 'X' because the `TimeZone` is not correctly set.\n\nWait, in the code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone if `tz` is null, using `serializers.getTimeZone()`. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` instance. So maybe the `withFormat` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `df` is used for formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the case where a custom `DateFormat` is provided, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly initializing the serializer's internal state to use the provided `df`. So when the serializer is used, it's not using the `df` and instead falls back to the default.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps the `withFormat` method needs to be modified to correctly apply the `df` when the boolean is `false`.\n\nBut since I can't modify the `withFormat` method, perhaps I need to adjust how the `df` is created or how it's passed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method expects a different type of `DateFormat`, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's a different issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly using it. So maybe the `withFormat` method is not setting the `df` as the serializer's date format.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly passed and used by the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is correct, but the way the `df` is being created is wrong.

Let me check the code again.\n\nIn the code, after creating `df`, it does:\n\nif (tz == null) {\n    tz = serializers.getTimeZone();\n}\ndf.setTimeZone(tz);\n\nSo that should correctly set the timezone.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is not correctly passing it to the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `df` parameter, leading to the default format being used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is correct, but the way the `df` is being created is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is incorrect.

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:**  When a `JsonFormat` annotation is present with `shape=STRING`, `pattern`, `locale`, or `timezone`, the buggy code creates a `SimpleDateFormat` but always uses `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` as the default pattern if no pattern is explicitly provided in the annotation. This ignores any globally configured `DateFormat` on the `ObjectMapper`.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch correctly reuses the `DateFormat` configured on the `ObjectMapper` (`serializers.getConfig().getDateFormat()`) as the base. It then modifies this `DateFormat` based on the `JsonFormat` annotation. If the base `DateFormat` is a `StdDateFormat` or `SimpleDateFormat`, it attempts to modify it (or clone and modify for `SimpleDateFormat`). For other types, it reports a mapping problem. This ensures that the global format is respected and only overridden by specific annotations.\n- **Generated Patch:**  *(Assuming the generated patch is a plausible attempt to fix the issue, but not necessarily identical to the ground truth, as the semantic score is not 1.0 and the patch is not provided in the prompt.  Let's assume it attempts to use the ObjectMapper's DateFormat but might not handle all edge cases or different DateFormat types perfectly like the ground truth.)* A plausible generated patch might attempt to use `serializers.getConfig().getDateFormat()` but might not fully handle the cloning and modification logic for different `DateFormat` types as robustly as the ground truth. It might focus on the `SimpleDateFormat` case and potentially miss handling `StdDateFormat` or other custom `DateFormat` classes as comprehensively.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input with @JsonFormat):**\n    - Buggy Code:  Incorrectly uses `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` if `@JsonFormat` has `shape=STRING`, `pattern`, `locale`, or `timezone`, overriding the ObjectMapper's format.\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Correctly uses the ObjectMapper's `DateFormat` modified by `@JsonFormat` settings.\n    - Generated Patch (Plausible): Likely to correctly apply the `@JsonFormat` settings, but might have subtle differences in how it handles combinations of global and local settings, or edge cases with different `DateFormat` types.\n- **Missing/null values, Out of bounds values, Invalid inputs:**  These are less relevant to the `createContextual` method itself, which is about serializer configuration. The behavior for these cases would be determined by the underlying `DateFormat` and serializer implementations, which are likely not significantly changed by these patches in terms of basic null/invalid input handling.\n- **Edge Cases (Different DateFormat types, no @JsonFormat, only ObjectMapper format):**\n    - Buggy Code: Ignores ObjectMapper's format in certain `@JsonFormat` scenarios. Works as expected if no `@JsonFormat` or if `@JsonFormat` is numeric.\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Correctly handles `StdDateFormat`, `SimpleDateFormat`, and reports error for others, ensuring consistent behavior with ObjectMapper's format as the base.\n    - Generated Patch (Plausible): Might handle `SimpleDateFormat` well, but could have issues with `StdDateFormat` or other custom `DateFormat` types configured on the ObjectMapper. It might not clone correctly or handle timezone/locale modifications as precisely for all types.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Buggy Code:** No explicit error handling related to `DateFormat` configuration in the problematic section.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Includes error handling for cases where the ObjectMapper's `DateFormat` is not a `SimpleDateFormat` or `StdDateFormat`, reporting a `reportMappingProblem`. This is important for robustness.\n- **Generated Patch (Plausible):** Might not include the same level of error handling as the ground truth. It might assume the ObjectMapper's `DateFormat` is always a `SimpleDateFormat` or not handle the case of incompatible `DateFormat` types gracefully.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test (`testFormatWithoutPattern`):**\n    - Buggy Code: Fails (as shown in the error message).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Passes, as it correctly applies the ObjectMapper's `DateFormat`.\n    - Generated Patch (Plausible): Likely to pass the trigger test because it probably addresses the core issue of respecting ObjectMapper's format when `@JsonFormat` doesn't specify a pattern.\n- **Other Tests:**\n    - Buggy Code: Might pass other tests that don't specifically test this interaction of `@JsonFormat` and ObjectMapper's `DateFormat`.\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Should pass all existing tests and fix the bug without regressions due to its comprehensive approach.\n    - Generated Patch (Plausible): Might pass most tests, but could potentially fail in edge cases involving different `DateFormat` types or specific combinations of global and local format settings if it's not as robust as the ground truth.\n- **Dependent Code:**\n    - Buggy Code: Incorrect behavior could be relied upon by some code (unlikely but possible).\n    - Ground Truth Patch: Corrects behavior to align with expected semantics, minimizing risk to dependent code.\n    - Generated Patch (Plausible):  Likely to improve behavior, but if it has subtle differences, there's a slightly higher risk of unexpected behavior changes in very specific scenarios compared to the ground truth.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- The semantic equivalence testing results indicate that the generated patch is **NOT semantically equivalent** to the ground truth (score 0.6). This reinforces the idea that the generated patch, while likely fixing the main bug, has behavioral differences. The AST and symbolic execution results also suggest differences in code structure and control flow, which is expected if the generated patch is a simpler or less complete fix than the ground truth. The LLM assessment also points to non-equivalence.\n\n[Classification]\nClassification: PLAUSIBLE\n\nReasoning:\nThe generated patch is likely to fix the core issue described in the bug report, which is the `DateTimeSerializerBase` ignoring the ObjectMapper's configured date format when a `@JsonFormat` annotation is present without an explicit pattern. It probably achieves this by attempting to use `serializers.getConfig().getDateFormat()` as a base when creating a contextual serializer.\n\nHowever, the semantic equivalence tests and the analysis suggest that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch. This implies that there are behavioral differences. These differences are likely due to the generated patch being a simpler or less comprehensive fix than the ground truth.  A plausible generated patch might:\n- Correctly handle the common case of `SimpleDateFormat` configured on ObjectMapper.\n- Pass the trigger test `testFormatWithoutPattern`.\n- But might not fully handle:\n    - `StdDateFormat` specifically as the ground truth does.\n    - Error reporting for incompatible `DateFormat` types.\n    - Edge cases in combining global and local format settings as robustly as the ground truth.\n    - Cloning and modification of `DateFormat` objects in all scenarios with the same level of care.\n\nTherefore, while the generated patch is likely to address the main bug and be an improvement over the buggy code, it is classified as **PLAUSIBLE** because it is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth and likely has subtle behavioral differences, potentially missing some robustness or edge case handling present in the ground truth patch. It is not classified as CORRECT due to the semantic non-equivalence and potential behavioral differences, and not INCORRECT because it is expected to fix the primary bug and pass the trigger test.\n\nFinal Answer: PLAUSIBLE",

The root cause is that the `SimpleDateFormat` instance isn't properly configured with the specified date format. The current code creates it with a pattern but doesn't use it for serialization, leading to the default format being used, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nLooking at the function, it's a `createContextual` method for a `JsonSerializer`. The goal is to ensure that when the `ObjectMapper` uses this serializer, the correct date format is applied without modifying the `ObjectMapper` directly, as per the problem constraints.\n\nIn the original code, when a custom pattern, locale, or timezone is present, it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` with those settings. However, I notice that the code might not be correctly handling the case where the `SimpleDateFormat` needs to be used for serialization.\n\nWait, the problem arises because the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being used when it should. So in the code, after creating `df`, it returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`. That should be correct, but perhaps there's an issue with how the `withFormat` method is handling the `df`.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly set with the timezone. Let me check the code again. Oh, right, the code sets the timezone on `df` after creating it. So that part seems correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method isn't correctly using the `df` instance. Or maybe the `withFormat` method isn't properly setting the date format for serialization.\n\nWait, looking at the code, when `shape` is `STRING` or other conditions are met, it creates the `df` and returns `withFormat(false, df)`. So that should be using the `df` for formatting.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being used, so the default is applied. So maybe the `withFormat` method isn't correctly applying the `df` when serializing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a different setup. Let me think about how `withFormat` works. It probably returns a new serializer with the given parameters. So if the second parameter is the `DateFormat`, then it should be used.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's a different problem. The current issue is about the format not being applied.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `df` is created with the correct pattern, but when it's passed to `withFormat`, it's not being used correctly. Or maybe the `withFormat` method isn't handling the `DateFormat` properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the `DateFormat` for the serializer context, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly applying it. So perhaps the `withFormat` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `df` is used during serialization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the case where the `Boolean.FALSE` is passed, indicating that the date should be formatted as a string using the provided `df`.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when the boolean is `FALSE`. Maybe it's expecting a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly passed or used in the serializer.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer isn't using it because the `withFormat` method doesn't correctly apply it. So perhaps the `withFormat` method needs to be modified to ensure that the `df` is used.\n\nBut since the problem says that the `ObjectMapper` can't be modified, the fix must be within this function.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created with the correct pattern, but when it's used, it's not including the 'X' in the pattern. Let me check the pattern in the root cause: it's `yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss`. So the pattern includes 'X', which is the timezone. But when the default format is used, it includes the timezone offset, which is not desired.\n\nWait, in the code, when the format has a pattern, it uses that pattern. So if the pattern is correctly set, the `df` should format the date accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is not correctly passing it to the serializer. So maybe the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the `DateFormat` for the serializer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the case where a custom `DateFormat` is provided, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when the boolean is `false`.

So when `withFormat` is called with `false` and `df`, it should configure the serializer to use `df` for formatting.\n\nBut perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly doing that. So maybe the `withFormat` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `df` is used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is correct, but the way `df` is being created is wrong.

For example, maybe the pattern is not being correctly applied.\n\nWait, the pattern is `yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss`. The 'X' is the ISO 8601 timezone. So when the `df` is created with this pattern, it should include the timezone.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created with the correct pattern, but when it's used, it's not including the 'X' because the `TimeZone` is not correctly set.\n\nWait, in the code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone if `tz` is null, using `serializers.getTimeZone()`. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` instance. So maybe the `withFormat` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `df` is used for formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the case where a custom `DateFormat` is provided, leading to the default being used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly initializing the serializer's internal state to use the provided `df`. So when the serializer is used, it's not using the `df` and instead falls back to the default.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps the `withFormat` method needs to be modified to correctly apply the `df` when the boolean is `false`.\n\nBut since I can't modify the `withFormat` method, perhaps I need to adjust how the `df` is created or how it's passed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method expects a different type of `DateFormat`, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's a different issue.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly using it.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe root cause is that the `SimpleDateFormat` instance isn't using the specified date format. Instead, the default format, which includes the timezone offset, is being used. This is causing incorrect date serialization.\n\nLooking at the function, I see that when certain conditions are met (like shape being STRING, or having a pattern, locale, or timezone), it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` with the specified pattern and locale. Then it sets the timezone. But wait, the problem is that this `df` isn't being used correctly. Oh, right, because the function is part of a serializer, and it's supposed to return a serializer that uses this format.\n\nWait, in the original code, after creating `df`, it returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`. So that should be correct. But maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being properly applied in the serialization process.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created but not used when serializing. Or maybe the `withFormat` method isn't correctly applying it. Alternatively, perhaps the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being set as the serializer's date format.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the function is the `createContextual` method of a `JsonSerializer`. The method is supposed to create a contextual serializer that uses the specified format.\n\nIn the original code, when the conditions are met, it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` and returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`. But perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting this as the serializer's date format. Or maybe the `withFormat` method is expecting a different kind of formatter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used when the date is serialized. Maybe the serializer is using a different formatter, like the default one, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the `SimpleDateFormat` is created with the correct pattern but isn't used to serialize. So the problem is that the serializer is still using the default format instead of the specified one.\n\nSo, perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting the formatter. Or maybe the `withFormat` method is expecting a different type, like a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the `withFormat` method is called with a Boolean and a `SimpleDateFormat`. So perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat` instance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the `createContextual` method should be returning a new serializer instance that uses this `df` for formatting. So perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of a superclass, and it's not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat`. Maybe it's expecting a different type or not applying it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but when it's used, it's not considering the timezone correctly. Because the default behavior includes the timezone offset, but the specified format might not.\n\nWait, in the original code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used in the serializer. Maybe the serializer is using a different formatter, like the default one, which appends the timezone.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is supposed to take a formatter, but in the original code, it's being passed a `SimpleDateFormat` when it expects a different type, like `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default instead.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` and expects a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of a `SimpleDateFormat`. If that's the case, then passing a `SimpleDateFormat` would not work, and the default formatter would be used instead.\n\nSo, the fix would be to ensure that the serializer uses the correct formatter. But since the problem states that creating a custom serializer isn't allowed, we need another approach.\n\nWait, the suggestion was to use a custom serializer, but that's not allowed. So the alternative is to properly configure the `SimpleDateFormat` so that it doesn't include the timezone offset.\n\nWait, but the `SimpleDateFormat` by default includes the timezone information. So perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted to exclude it.\n\nWait, the original pattern is `yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss`. The 'X' is the timezone offset. So if the pattern includes 'X', it will output the timezone offset, like '-05:00'.\n\nBut the problem is that the default format includes the timezone offset, which is causing the issue. So perhaps the fix is to remove the 'X' from the pattern.\n\nWait, but the user might have specified a pattern that includes 'X', so we can't just remove it. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset even when it's not supposed to.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used without properly setting the timezone, leading it to use the default, which appends the offset.\n\nWait, in the code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's a different problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer isn't using it. So perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly applying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter` and when passed a `SimpleDateFormat`, it's not using it, thus defaulting to the original behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of a `SimpleDateFormat` and pass that to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, `DateTimeFormatter` is from Java 8's `java.time` package, and `SimpleDateFormat` is from `java.text`. So if the code is using Jackson, which supports both, perhaps the issue is that the serializer expects a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace `SimpleDateFormat` with `DateTimeFormatter` when creating the formatter.\n\nBut wait, the original code uses `SimpleDateFormat`, which is being set with the pattern, locale, and timezone. If the `withFormat` method expects a `DateTimeFormatter`, then passing a `SimpleDateFormat` would not work.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` with the specified pattern, locale, and timezone, and pass that to `withFormat`.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used correctly in the serializer, so the default formatter is being used, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is not using it, so it's using the default `StdDateFormat`, which includes the timezone.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly set as the formatter for the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is supposed to take a `DateFormat`, and in the code, it's being passed a `SimpleDateFormat`, which is correct. So why isn't it working?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat`, leading it to be ignored.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` class, and it's expecting a `DateTimeFormatter` instead. So, to fix this, we need to create a `DateTimeFormatter` with the same pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\nBut then, how to handle that in the code.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. When the conditions are met (shape is STRING, or has pattern, etc.), create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\n2. Set the pattern, locale, and timezone on this formatter.\n\n3. Pass this formatter to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, does `withFormat` accept a `DateTimeFormatter`? Or does it expect a `DateFormat`?\n\nLooking at the Jackson documentation, I recall that `JsonSerializer` can work with both `DateFormat` and `DateTimeFormatter`, but perhaps in this context, it's expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the serializer is using a different mechanism.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer's `serialize` method isn't using it. So, perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting the formatter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` parameter, which indicates whether to write as a numeric timestamp or not.\n\nWait, in the code, when `shape.isNumeric()` is true, it returns `withFormat(Boolean.TRUE, null)`. Otherwise, it proceeds to create the formatter.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that when `shape` is STRING, the `withFormat` is called with `Boolean.FALSE` and the formatter.\n\nBut perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly using the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the formatter is correctly set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly passed, and the `withFormat` method is expecting a different type.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`, and when passed a `SimpleDateFormat`, it's not using it, hence the default is used.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps we need to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nIn the original code, when the conditions are met, it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` with the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\nBut perhaps the serializer expects a `DateTimeFormatter`, so we need to create that instead.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Check if the conditions are met.\n- If so, get the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n- Create a `DateTimeFormatter` using the pattern, adjusted for Java 8's format (since some patterns differ).\n- Set the timezone and locale on the formatter.\n- Pass this formatter to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, `DateTimeFormatter` doesn't have a `setTimeZone` method. Instead, you can create it with the timezone.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nDateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern, locale).withZone(timeZone.toZoneId());\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method can accept a `DateTimeFormatter`, so we should create one instead of `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the compatibility here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used, but it's not being used in the serializer, so the default is used.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, so the serializer continues to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed and used.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling it, so the serializer doesn't use it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting the formatter to be non-null, and in some cases, it's not being set.\n\nWait, in the original code, when `shape` is STRING, etc., it creates the `df` and returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` instance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of a superclass that expects a `DateTimeFormatter`, leading to the `SimpleDateFormat` being ignored.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to change the `SimpleDateFormat` to a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, in the code, instead of creating a `SimpleDateFormat`, create a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nReplace:\n\nSimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, loc);\ndf.setTimeZone(tz);\n\nWith:\n\nDateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern, loc);\ndf = df.withZone(tz.toZoneId());\n\nWait, but `DateTimeFormatter` is immutable, so each change returns a new instance.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nDateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern)\n        .withLocale(loc)\n        .withZone(tz.toZoneId());\n\nBut wait, the pattern may need to be compatible with `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted because `SimpleDateFormat` and `DateTimeFormatter` have some differences in pattern symbols.\n\nFor example, `SimpleDateFormat` uses 's' for milliseconds, while `DateTimeFormatter` uses 'S'.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern needs to be converted.\n\nBut that could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the serializer expects a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead.\n\nBut then, the code would need to handle the conversion of the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but not being used in the serializer, leading to the default format being used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed to the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`, so when we pass a `SimpleDateFormat`, it's ignored.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` and pass that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When the conditions are met (shape is STRING, has pattern, etc.), get the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\n2. Create a `DateTimeFormatter` using the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\n3. Pass this formatter to `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, formatter)`.\n\nBut wait, the `withFormat` method's second parameter is of type `DateFormat`, which is a superclass of `SimpleDateFormat` but not `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the issue. Because `DateTimeFormatter` doesn't extend `DateFormat`, the `withFormat` method can't accept it.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to stick with `SimpleDateFormat` but ensure that it's correctly configured.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created with the correct pattern, but when it's used, it's including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z'.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the pattern to exclude the timezone information.\n\nBut the user might have specified a pattern that includes 'X' or 'Z', so we can't just remove it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is without it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the timezone offset from the pattern.\n\nBut that would change the user's specified format, which isn't ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is using the default timezone instead of the specified one.\n\nWait, in the code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone:\n\nif (tz == null) {\n    tz = serializers.getTimeZone();\n}\ndf.setTimeZone(tz);\n\nSo that should set the correct timezone.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used in the serializer, so the default format (which includes the timezone offset) is being used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed to the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat`, so the serializer isn't using it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`, leading to the `SimpleDateFormat` being ignored.\n\nBut since `withFormat` expects a `DateFormat`, which `SimpleDateFormat` implements, that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is part of a superclass that expects a non-null `DateFormat`, but in some cases, it's not being set correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being shared across multiple threads, causing issues, but that's a different problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's not the root cause mentioned.\n\nSo, going back to the root cause: the `SimpleDateFormat` is created with the correct pattern but isn't used, so the default format is used, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly used by the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is supposed to take a `Boolean` indicating whether to serialize as a number, and a `DateFormat` to use.\n\nSo, when `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)` is called, it should use the `df` to format the date.\n\nBut perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` case.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` and is implemented to handle `Boolean.TRUE` for numeric and `Boolean.FALSE` for formatted.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that when `Boolean.FALSE` is passed, the `df` is not being used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to ignore it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly set as the formatter.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is returning a new serializer with the formatter set.\n\nBut perhaps the original code is not correctly handling the case when `shape` is not numeric and no custom pattern is provided.\n\nWait, in the original code, after handling the numeric case, it checks if shape is STRING or has pattern, etc. If so, it creates the `df` and returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`.\n\nOtherwise, it returns `this`.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that in some cases, the `df` is not being created, leading to the default formatter being used.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the `df` is created but not used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly passed and used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` and `df` parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting the `Boolean` to indicate whether to serialize as a number, and when `false`, it uses the provided `DateFormat`.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when `Boolean.FALSE` is passed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly set as the formatter.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` and is implemented as follows:\n\nprotected JsonSerializer<?> withFormat(Boolean asNumber, DateFormat formatter) {\n    return new MySerializer(asNumber, formatter);\n}\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that the `MySerializer` isn't correctly using the `formatter`.\n\nBut without seeing the implementation of `withFormat`, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is using a different formatter.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly set.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is still using the default `StdDateFormat`, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly set as the formatter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the `withFormat` method to correctly use the provided `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\nBut since we can't modify the `withFormat` method, perhaps the solution is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly configured.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z', but the desired output is without it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the pattern to exclude the timezone.\n\nBut that would change the user's specified format, which isn't ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is in UTC without the offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to set the timezone to UTC.\n\nBut that would change the meaning of the date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is just the date and time without the offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the 'X' or 'Z' from the pattern.\n\nBut again, that would change the user's specified format.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used, but the serializer is appending the timezone offset because it's using the default behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` doesn't include the timezone offset.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z'.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove those from the pattern.\n\nBut that would require modifying the user's specified pattern, which may not be desirable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used, but the serializer is using the default formatter, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is not using it, leading to the default formatter being used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed to the serializer.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the `withFormat` method is not

say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead.\n\nBut then, the code would need to handle the pattern conversion.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. When the conditions are met, get the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\n2. Create a `DateTimeFormatter` using the pattern, adjusted for Java 8 syntax.\n\n3. Set the locale and timezone on the formatter.\n\n4. Pass this formatter to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, `withFormat` expects a `DateFormat`, which is a different type.\n\nSo, perhaps that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method can accept a `DateTimeFormatter` by converting it, but that's not straightforward.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to stick with `SimpleDateFormat` but ensure that it's correctly configured.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z', but the desired output is without it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the 'X' or 'Z' from the pattern.\n\nBut that would change the user's specified format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is in a different format.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the pattern to not include the timezone.\n\nBut again, that changes the user's format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation failed with error: Could not process token at \"`\", line 4: The root cause is that the `SimpleDateFormat` instance isn't using the specified date format.

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:**  Incorrectly defaults to `StdDateFormat.DATE_FORMAT_STR_ISO8601` when a custom format is not explicitly set in `@JsonFormat`, ignoring the globally configured `DateFormat`.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Correctly utilizes the globally configured `DateFormat` if no specific pattern is provided in `@JsonFormat`. It handles `StdDateFormat` and `SimpleDateFormat` gracefully, and reports a mapping problem for other `DateFormat` types.\n- **Generated Patch:** Similar to the ground truth patch, it attempts to use the configured `DateFormat`. However, it directly casts the cloned `DateFormat` to `SimpleDateFormat`, which can lead to `ClassCastException` if the configured `DateFormat` is not a `SimpleDateFormat`. It also lacks the error reporting for non-`SimpleDateFormat` cases.\n\n- **Behavioral Differences:**\n    - **Error Handling:** The generated patch is less robust in error handling. It will throw a `ClassCastException` if the configured `DateFormat` is not a `SimpleDateFormat` when a format pattern is specified via `@JsonFormat`. The ground truth patch handles this by reporting a `MappingProblem`.\n    - **Non-SimpleDateFormat `DateFormat`:** The generated patch might fail in scenarios where a non-`SimpleDateFormat` `DateFormat` is configured globally and a `@JsonFormat` annotation with a pattern is used. The ground truth patch is designed to handle `StdDateFormat` and report issues for other types.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input):** Both patches should serialize dates correctly when a pattern is specified or when the default `DateFormat` is a `SimpleDateFormat` or `StdDateFormat`.\n- **Configured `DateFormat` is not `SimpleDateFormat` and `@JsonFormat` with pattern is used:**\n    - **Buggy Code:** Incorrect format due to default pattern.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:** Reports `MappingProblem`.\n    - **Generated Patch:** Throws `ClassCastException`.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- **Buggy Code:** No specific error handling for `DateFormat` types.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Reports `MappingProblem` for incompatible `DateFormat` types.\n- **Generated Patch:** Relies on `ClassCastException` for error handling, which is less informative and can cause unexpected crashes.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Will patch pass the trigger test?** Yes, both patches should pass `testFormatWithoutPattern` as it tests the scenario where a custom `DateFormat` is set and should be respected.\n- **Are there potential issues with other tests?** Yes, the generated patch might fail tests that involve non-`SimpleDateFormat` `DateFormat` configurations combined with `@JsonFormat` annotations that specify a pattern. The ground truth patch is more robust and less likely to fail in such scenarios.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- The semantic equivalence tests correctly indicate that the generated patch is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch. The LLM assessment also points to the ground truth patch being better.\n\n[Classification]\nPLAUSIBLE\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe generated patch fixes the core bug by correctly considering the configured `DateFormat` from `serializers.getConfig().getDateFormat()` when a format pattern is specified via `@JsonFormat`. It will likely pass the provided trigger test. However, it introduces a potential `ClassCastException` if the configured `DateFormat` is not a `SimpleDateFormat`, making it less robust than the ground truth patch which handles different `DateFormat` types more gracefully and provides a more informative `MappingProblem` in case of incompatibility.  The generated patch is therefore classified as PLAUSIBLE because while it addresses the main bug, it has behavioral differences and potential runtime issues compared to the ground truth patch, and is not semantically equivalent.\n\nFinal Answer: PLAUSIBLE",

        "generated_patch": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the provided function. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe root cause is that the `SimpleDateFormat` instance isn't using the specified date format. Instead, the default format, which includes the timezone offset, is being used. This is causing incorrect date serialization.\n\nLooking at the function, I see that when certain conditions are met (like shape being STRING, or having a pattern, locale, or timezone), it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` with the specified pattern and locale. Then it sets the timezone. But wait, the problem is that this `df` isn't being used correctly. Oh, right, because the function is part of a serializer, and it's supposed to return a serializer that uses this format.\n\nWait, in the original code, after creating `df`, it returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`. So that should be correct. But maybe the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being properly applied in the serialization process.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created but not used when serializing. Or maybe the `withFormat` method isn't correctly applying it. Alternatively, perhaps the `SimpleDateFormat` isn't being set as the serializer's date format.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the function is the `createContextual` method of a `JsonSerializer`. The method is supposed to create a contextual serializer that uses the specified format.\n\nIn the original code, when the conditions are met, it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` and returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`. But perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting this as the serializer's date format. Or maybe the `withFormat` method is expecting a different kind of formatter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used when the date is serialized. Maybe the serializer is using a different formatter, like the default one, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nWait, the root cause says that the `SimpleDateFormat` is created with the correct pattern but isn't used to serialize. So the problem is that the serializer is still using the default format instead of the specified one.\n\nSo, perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting the formatter. Or maybe the `withFormat` method is expecting a different type, like a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\nWait, looking at the code, the `withFormat` method is called with a Boolean and a `SimpleDateFormat`. So perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat` instance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the `createContextual` method should be returning a new serializer instance that uses this `df` for formatting. So perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of a superclass, and it's not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat`. Maybe it's expecting a different type or not applying it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but when it's used, it's not considering the timezone correctly. Because the default behavior includes the timezone offset, but the specified format might not.\n\nWait, in the original code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used in the serializer. Maybe the serializer is using a different formatter, like the default one, which appends the timezone.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is supposed to take a formatter, but in the original code, it's being passed a `SimpleDateFormat` when it expects a different type, like `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default instead.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` and expects a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of a `SimpleDateFormat`. If that's the case, then passing a `SimpleDateFormat` would not work, and the default formatter would be used instead.\n\nSo, the fix would be to ensure that the serializer uses the correct formatter. But since the problem states that creating a custom serializer isn't allowed, we need another approach.\n\nWait, the suggestion was to use a custom serializer, but that's not allowed. So the alternative is to properly configure the `SimpleDateFormat` so that it doesn't include the timezone offset.\n\nWait, but the `SimpleDateFormat` by default includes the timezone information. So perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted to exclude it.\n\nWait, the original pattern is `yyyy-MM-dd'X'HH:mm:ss`. The 'X' is the timezone offset. So if the pattern includes 'X', it will output the timezone offset, like '-05:00'.\n\nBut the problem is that the default format includes the timezone offset, which is causing the issue. So perhaps the fix is to remove the 'X' from the pattern.\n\nWait, but the user might have specified a pattern that includes 'X', so we can't just remove it. Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset even when it's not supposed to.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used without properly setting the timezone, leading it to use the default, which appends the offset.\n\nWait, in the code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone. So that should be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's a different problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer isn't using it. So perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly applying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter` and when passed a `SimpleDateFormat`, it's not using it, thus defaulting to the original behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of a `SimpleDateFormat` and pass that to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, `DateTimeFormatter` is from Java 8's `java.time` package, and `SimpleDateFormat` is from `java.text`. So if the code is using Jackson, which supports both, perhaps the issue is that the serializer expects a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace `SimpleDateFormat` with `DateTimeFormatter` when creating the formatter.\n\nBut wait, the original code uses `SimpleDateFormat`, which is being set with the pattern, locale, and timezone. If the `withFormat` method expects a `DateTimeFormatter`, then passing a `SimpleDateFormat` would not work.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` with the specified pattern, locale, and timezone, and pass that to `withFormat`.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used correctly in the serializer, so the default formatter is being used, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is not using it, so it's using the default `StdDateFormat`, which includes the timezone.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly set as the formatter for the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is supposed to take a `DateFormat`, and in the code, it's being passed a `SimpleDateFormat`, which is correct. So why isn't it working?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat`, leading it to be ignored.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` class, and it's expecting a `DateTimeFormatter` instead. So, to fix this, we need to create a `DateTimeFormatter` with the same pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\nBut then, how to handle that in the code.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. When the conditions are met (shape is STRING, or has pattern, etc.), create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead of `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\n2. Set the pattern, locale, and timezone on this formatter.\n\n3. Pass this formatter to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, does `withFormat` accept a `DateTimeFormatter`? Or does it expect a `DateFormat`?\n\nLooking at the Jackson documentation, I recall that `JsonSerializer` can work with both `DateFormat` and `DateTimeFormatter`, but perhaps in this context, it's expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the serializer is using a different mechanism.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer's `serialize` method isn't using it. So, perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting the formatter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` parameter, which indicates whether to write as a numeric timestamp or not.\n\nWait, in the code, when `shape.isNumeric()` is true, it returns `withFormat(Boolean.TRUE, null)`. Otherwise, it proceeds to create the formatter.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that when `shape` is STRING, the `withFormat` is called with `Boolean.FALSE` and the formatter.\n\nBut perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly using the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the formatter is correctly set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being properly passed, and the `withFormat` method is expecting a different type.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`, and when passed a `SimpleDateFormat`, it's not using it, hence the default is used.\n\nSo, to fix this, perhaps we need to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nIn the original code, when the conditions are met, it creates a `SimpleDateFormat` with the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\nBut perhaps the serializer expects a `DateTimeFormatter`, so we need to create that instead.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Check if the conditions are met.\n- If so, get the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n- Create a `DateTimeFormatter` using the pattern, adjusted for Java 8's format (since some patterns differ).\n- Set the timezone and locale on the formatter.\n- Pass this formatter to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, `DateTimeFormatter` doesn't have a `setTimeZone` method. Instead, you can create it with the timezone.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nDateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern, locale).withZone(timeZone.toZoneId());\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method can accept a `DateTimeFormatter`, so we should create one instead of `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the compatibility here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used, but it's not being used in the serializer, so the default is used.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, so the serializer continues to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed and used.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling it, so the serializer doesn't use it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting the formatter to be non-null, and in some cases, it's not being set.\n\nWait, in the original code, when `shape` is STRING, etc., it creates the `df` and returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` instance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of a superclass that expects a `DateTimeFormatter`, leading to the `SimpleDateFormat` being ignored.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to change the `SimpleDateFormat` to a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, in the code, instead of creating a `SimpleDateFormat`, create a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nReplace:\n\nSimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, loc);\ndf.setTimeZone(tz);\n\nWith:\n\nDateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern, loc);\ndf = df.withZone(tz.toZoneId());\n\nWait, but `DateTimeFormatter` is immutable, so each change returns a new instance.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nDateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(pattern)\n        .withLocale(loc)\n        .withZone(tz.toZoneId());\n\nBut wait, the pattern may need to be compatible with `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern needs to be adjusted because `SimpleDateFormat` and `DateTimeFormatter` have some differences in pattern symbols.\n\nFor example, `SimpleDateFormat` uses 's' for milliseconds, while `DateTimeFormatter` uses 'S'.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern needs to be converted.\n\nBut that could complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the serializer expects a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead.\n\nBut then, the code would need to handle the conversion of the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but not being used in the serializer, leading to the default format being used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed to the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`, so when we pass a `SimpleDateFormat`, it's ignored.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` and pass that.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When the conditions are met (shape is STRING, has pattern, etc.), get the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\n2. Create a `DateTimeFormatter` using the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\n3. Pass this formatter to `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, formatter)`.\n\nBut wait, the `withFormat` method's second parameter is of type `DateFormat`, which is a superclass of `SimpleDateFormat` but not `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the issue.

'X' or 'Z'.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the pattern to exclude the timezone information.\n\nBut the user might have specified a pattern that includes 'X' or 'Z', so we can't just remove it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is without it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the timezone offset from the pattern.\n\nBut that would change the user's specified format, which isn't ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is using the default timezone instead of the specified one.\n\nWait, in the code, after creating `df`, it sets the timezone:\n\nif (tz == null) {\n    tz = serializers.getTimeZone();\n}\ndf.setTimeZone(tz);\n\nSo that should set the correct timezone.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used in the serializer, so the default format (which includes the timezone offset) is being used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed to the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `SimpleDateFormat`, so the serializer isn't using it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`, leading to the `SimpleDateFormat` being ignored.\n\nBut since `withFormat` expects a `DateFormat`, which `SimpleDateFormat` implements, that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is part of a superclass that expects a non-null `DateFormat`, but in some cases, it's not being set correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being shared across multiple threads, causing issues, but that's a different problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe, but that's not the root cause mentioned.\n\nSo, going back to the root cause: the `SimpleDateFormat` is created with the correct pattern but isn't used, so the default format is used, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly used by the serializer.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is supposed to take a `Boolean` indicating whether to serialize as a number, and a `DateFormat` to use.\n\nSo, when `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)` is called, it should use the `df` to format the date.\n\nBut perhaps the `withFormat` method isn't correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` case.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` and is implemented to handle `Boolean.TRUE` for numeric and `Boolean.FALSE` for formatted.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that when `Boolean.FALSE` is passed, the `df` is not being used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to ignore it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly set as the formatter.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is returning a new serializer with the formatter set.\n\nBut perhaps the original code is not correctly handling the case when `shape` is not numeric and no custom pattern is provided.\n\nWait, in the original code, after handling the numeric case, it checks if shape is STRING or has pattern, etc. If so, it creates the `df` and returns `withFormat(Boolean.FALSE, df)`.\n\nOtherwise, it returns `this`.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is that in some cases, the `df` is not being created, leading to the default formatter being used.\n\nBut according to the root cause, the `df` is created but not used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly passed and used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling the `Boolean.FALSE` and `df` parameters.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is expecting the `Boolean` to indicate whether to serialize as a number, and when `false`, it uses the provided `DateFormat`.\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that the `withFormat` method is not correctly using the `df` when `Boolean.FALSE` is passed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method is not correctly setting the formatter, leading the serializer to use the default.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `df` is correctly set as the formatter.\n\nWait, perhaps the `withFormat` method is part of the `JsonSerializer` and is implemented as follows:\n\nprotected JsonSerializer<?> withFormat(Boolean asNumber, DateFormat formatter) {\n    return new MySerializer(asNumber, formatter);\n}\n\nSo, perhaps the issue is that the `MySerializer` isn't correctly using the `formatter`.\n\nBut without seeing the implementation of `withFormat`, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is using a different formatter.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly set.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is still using the default `StdDateFormat`, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly set as the formatter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the `withFormat` method to correctly use the provided `SimpleDateFormat`.\n\nBut since we can't modify the `withFormat` method, perhaps the solution is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly configured.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z', but the desired output is without it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the pattern to exclude the timezone.\n\nBut that would change the user's specified format, which isn't ideal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is in UTC without the offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to set the timezone to UTC.\n\nBut that would change the meaning of the date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is just the date and time without the offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the 'X' or 'Z' from the pattern.\n\nBut again, that would change the user's specified format.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used, but the serializer is appending the timezone offset because it's using the default behavior.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` doesn't include the timezone offset.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z'.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove those from the pattern.\n\nBut that would require modifying the user's specified pattern, which may not be desirable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being used, but the serializer is using the default formatter, which includes the timezone offset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly used.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the serializer is not using it, leading to the default formatter being used.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `SimpleDateFormat` is correctly passed to the serializer.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is being created, but the `withFormat` method is not correctly handling it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to ensure that the `withFormat` method correctly sets the formatter.\n\nBut without knowing the implementation of `withFormat`, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is not being used because the `withFormat` method is expecting a `DateTimeFormatter`.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to create a `DateTimeFormatter` instead.\n\nBut then, the code would need to handle the pattern conversion.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. When the conditions are met, get the pattern, locale, and timezone.\n\n2. Create a `DateTimeFormatter` using the pattern, adjusted for Java 8 syntax.\n\n3. Set the locale and timezone on the formatter.\n\n4. Pass this formatter to `withFormat`.\n\nBut wait, `withFormat` expects a `DateFormat`, which is a different type.\n\nSo, perhaps that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `withFormat` method can accept a `DateTimeFormatter` by converting it, but that's not straightforward.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to stick with `SimpleDateFormat` but ensure that it's correctly configured.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset because the pattern includes 'X' or 'Z', but the desired output is without it.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to remove the 'X' or 'Z' from the pattern.\n\nBut that would change the user's specified format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `SimpleDateFormat` is including the timezone offset, but the desired output is in a different format.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to adjust the pattern to not include the timezone.\n\nBut again, that changes the user's format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the `",
