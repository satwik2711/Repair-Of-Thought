Let me read through the problem and the code carefully.\n\nThe root cause is that the function doesn't handle the BOM correctly when the charset isn't specified. The BOM is a byte order mark that can indicate the encoding of the text. If it's present, the current code doesn't skip it before decoding, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nLooking at the function, when charsetName is null, it tries to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags. But before that, it decodes the byteData using the default charset, which might be wrong if a BOM is present.\n\nThe suggestion is to check for the BOM before decoding. So, I should add a step to detect the BOM and skip it if present.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. I'll need to check the first few bytes of the byteData for known BOM signatures. The common ones are for UTF-8 (0xEFBBBF), UTF-16 (0xFEFF), and UTF-16BE (0xFFFE). \n\nI'll create a helper method to check for these BOMs. If a BOM is found, I'll skip those bytes and note the charset. Then, I'll decode the remaining bytes with that charset instead of the default.\n\nWait, but the default charset is used initially. So, perhaps the initial decoding should be adjusted based on the BOM.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check the byteData for a BOM.\n2. If a BOM is found, determine the corresponding charset (like UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.).\n3. Skip the BOM bytes and decode the rest using the detected charset.\n4. If no BOM is found, proceed as before, decoding with the default charset and then checking the meta tags.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with defaultCharset, it checks the meta tags and might re-decode. So, if the BOM indicates a different charset, we should handle that before the initial decode.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\n- Before decoding, check for BOM.\n- If BOM is present, extract the charset and skip the BOM bytes.\n- Then, decode using that charset.\n- If no BOM, proceed with defaultCharset.\n\nBut how do I check for BOM? Let's think about the byteData. It's a ByteBuffer, so I can check the first few bytes.\n\nI'll need to check for the BOM in a way that doesn't consume the bytes, or if I do, I'll have to adjust the buffer's position.\n\nWait, the byteData is a ByteBuffer. So, I can check the first bytes without modifying the buffer by using get() and position.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a copy or a wrapped buffer to avoid changing the original position.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to check the first few bytes, determine if a BOM exists, and then adjust the buffer accordingly.\n\nLet me sketch the code:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check if byteData starts with a BOM.\n- If so, determine the charset and skip the BOM bytes.\n- Decode the rest with the detected charset.\n- Then proceed to check meta tags as before.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks the meta tags and may re-decode. So, if the BOM indicates a different charset, perhaps that should take precedence over the meta tags.\n\nHmm, but the BOM is more reliable than the meta tags. So, if a BOM is present, we should use that charset and not rely on the meta tags.\n\nWait, but the original code's logic is: if charsetName is null, decode with default charset, then check meta tags, and if found, re-decode. But if the BOM is present, the initial decode with default charset is wrong, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nSo, the fix should be: before decoding, check for BOM, and if present, decode with the corresponding charset, skipping the BOM.\n\nSo, in the code, when charsetName is null, first check for BOM.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the BOM check.\n\nI can create a method that takes the ByteBuffer and returns the charset if a BOM is found, along with the number of bytes to skip.\n\nFor example:\n\nprivate static class BomInfo {\n    String charset;\n    int bytesToSkip;\n\n    BomInfo(String charset, int bytesToSkip) {\n        this.charset = charset;\n        this.bytesToSkip = bytesToSkip;\n    }\n}\n\nBomInfo detectBom(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    if (byteData.remaining() < 2) return null;\n\n    byte[] bomBytes = new byte[3];\n    byteData.get(bomBytes, 0, Math.min(3, byteData.remaining()));\n    // Now check for each BOM possibility\n    if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-8\", 3);\n    } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16\", 2);\n    } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16LE\", 2);\n    } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0x00 && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0x00 && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xFE && bomBytes[3] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n        // UTF-32 BOM, but this is less common\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-32\", 4);\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\nWait, but for UTF-16BE, the BOM is FE FF, and for UTF-16LE it's FF FE. So, in the code above, I have to check for both possibilities.\n\nWait, in the detectBom method, I should check for all possible BOMs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for the different BOMs in order of their byte lengths.\n\nAlternatively, I can check for the different BOM signatures.\n\nSo, in the detectBom method:\n\nCheck if the first two bytes are FE FF: that's UTF-16BE BOM.\n\nIf the first two bytes are FF FE: that's UTF-16LE BOM.\n\nIf the first three bytes are EF BB BF: that's UTF-8 BOM.\n\nIf the first four bytes are 00 00 FE FF: that's UTF-32 BOM.\n\nWait, but in the code, the byteData is a ByteBuffer, so I can get the bytes without advancing the position by using get() and position.\n\nWait, no, because get() without an index will advance the position. So, perhaps I should mark the position, get the bytes, and then reset.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a temporary buffer that is a copy of the original, so that I can peek at the bytes without affecting the original buffer's position.\n\nSo, in the detectBom method:\n\nByteBuffer tempBuffer = byteData.duplicate();\ntempBuffer.position(0);\nint remaining = tempBuffer.remaining();\n\nThen read up to 4 bytes into a byte array.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nbyte[] bomBytes = new byte[4];\nint bytesRead = tempBuffer.get(bomBytes);\n\nThen, check the bytes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nBomInfo detectBom(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    ByteBuffer tempBuffer = byteData.duplicate();\n    tempBuffer.position(0);\n    byte[] bomBytes = new byte[4];\n    int bytesRead = tempBuffer.get(bomBytes);\n    tempBuffer.rewind();\n\n    if (bytesRead >= 3) {\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF &&\n            bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB &&\n            bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-8\", 3);\n        }\n    }\n    if (bytesRead >= 2) {\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFE &&\n            bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16BE\", 2);\n        } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFF &&\n                   bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16LE\", 2);\n        }\n    }\n    if (bytesRead >= 4) {\n        if (bomBytes[0] == 0x00 &&\n            bomBytes[1] == 0x00 &&\n            bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xFE &&\n            bomBytes[3] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-32\", 4);\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\nWait, but for UTF-32, the BOM is 0x00 0x00 0xFE 0xFF, which is big-endian. There's also little-endian, but I think that's less common.\n\nSo, in the function, when charsetName is null, I'll first check for BOM.\n\nIf BOM is found, I'll get the charset and the number of bytes to skip.\n\nThen, I'll adjust the byteData buffer by skipping those bytes.\n\nThen, decode the rest with the detected charset.\n\nIf no BOM is found, proceed with the default charset.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    BomInfo bomInfo = detectBom(byteData);\n    if (bomInfo != null) {\n        // Skip the BOM bytes\n        byteData.position(bomInfo.bytesToSkip);\n        charsetName = bomInfo.charset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n    } else {\n        // No BOM found, use default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags as before\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks the meta tags and may re-decode. So, if we have a BOM, we should use that charset and not rely on the meta tags, because the BOM is more authoritative.\n\nBut wait, the original code's logic is that if the charset is null, it first decodes as default charset, then looks for meta tags, and if found, re-decodes.\n\nBut with the BOM, perhaps we should prioritize that over the meta tags.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, when a BOM is detected, we decode using that charset, and then we don't need to check the meta tags because the BOM is more reliable.\n\nWait, but the original code's logic is that even if you have a BOM, it's possible that the meta tags specify a different charset. But that's unlikely, and perhaps the BOM should take precedence.\n\nHmm, but according to standards, the BOM is an explicit indication of the encoding, so it should override any meta tags.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, if a BOM is detected, we should use that charset and skip the meta tag detection.\n\nBut wait, the original code's logic is that after decoding with default charset, it parses the HTML, looks for meta tags, and if found, re-decodes. So, if the BOM is present, the initial decode is wrong, leading to incorrect parsing of the meta tags.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check for BOM.\n2. If BOM is found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n3. Then, parse the HTML, and check for meta tags. If meta tags specify a different charset, re-decode.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary because the BOM is more reliable. But perhaps the function should still check the meta tags in case the BOM is incorrect or missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should take precedence, and the meta tags should be ignored if a BOM is present.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The original code's logic is that the meta tags can override the initial charset, which is default or from BOM.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- If BOM is present, use its charset and skip the bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check the meta tags. If they specify a different charset, re-decode.\n\nBut that could cause issues if the BOM and meta tags disagree. But in practice, that's unlikely, and the BOM is more authoritative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM detection should be done regardless of charsetName being null or not.\n\nWait, looking back at the original code, there's a section after decoding where it checks if the first character is 65279 (which is the BOM in UTF-8, as 0xFEFF is 65279 in decimal). So, the code tries to handle the BOM after decoding, but only for UTF-8.\n\nBut this approach is flawed because if the initial decode was with the wrong charset, the BOM might not be correctly recognized.\n\nSo, the fix is to handle the BOM before decoding.\n\nSo, integrating this into the function:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM.\n- If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check meta tags. If a different charset is found, re-decode.\n\nWait, but if the BOM is present, perhaps the meta tags should not override it. Because the BOM is a more direct indication of the encoding.\n\nBut the original code allows the meta tags to override the initial charset, which could be the default or from the BOM.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to first check for BOM, use that charset, and then, if the meta tags specify a different charset, re-decode.\n\nBut that could lead to double-decoding, which is inefficient but perhaps necessary for correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should take precedence, and the meta tags should be ignored if a BOM is present.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The original code's logic is that the meta tags can override the initial charset, which is why it re-decodes if necessary.\n\nSo, perhaps the fixed code should:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check for BOM.\n2. If BOM is found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n3. Then, parse the HTML.\n4. Then, check meta tags. If a different charset is found, re-decode.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the BOM is just the initial step, and the meta tags can still override it.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the BOM is a more reliable indicator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should be the final authority, and the meta tags should not override it.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to follow the HTTP specifications, which state that the BOM is an authoritative source of encoding information, and meta tags are only considered if the BOM is absent.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, if a BOM is present, the charset is determined from the BOM, and the meta tags are not considered.\n\nBut the original code's logic is that even if a BOM is present, it's possible that the meta tags could change the charset. So, perhaps the code should still check the meta tags after decoding with the BOM's charset.\n\nBut that could lead to incorrect decoding if the meta tags specify a different charset.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to adjust the code so that:\n\n- If charsetName is null, check for BOM first.\n- If BOM is found, decode with that charset, skipping the BOM bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check the meta tags. If a charset is found, compare it with the BOM's charset. If different, perhaps log a warning but proceed with the BOM's charset, or perhaps re-decode.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the BOM's charset should take precedence, and the meta tags should be ignored in that case.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the original code's logic.\n\nIn the original code, when charsetName is null, it decodes with default charset, then parses, then checks meta tags.

If a different charset is found, re-decode.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the meta tags could override the BOM, which is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should be the authoritative source, and the meta tags should not override it.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be adjusted to:\n\nIf charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM. If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n- Parse HTML.\n- Do not check meta tags for charset in this case, because BOM is already used.\n\nBut that would change the original logic, which allows meta tags to override.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to let the BOM take precedence, and only check meta tags if no BOM is present.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    BomInfo bomInfo = detectBom(byteData);\n    if (bomInfo != null) {\n        // Use BOM's charset\n        byteData.position(bomInfo.bytesToSkip);\n        charsetName = bomInfo.charset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        // Since BOM is present, we don't need to check meta tags for charset\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, proceed as before\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        // Check meta tags and possibly re-decode\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            // ... existing code to get foundCharset\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                // re-decode\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // existing code\n}\n\nWait, but in this approach, when a BOM is present, we don't check the meta tags at all. So, if the meta tags specify a different charset, it's ignored.\n\nIs that correct? According to standards, yes, because the BOM is a more direct indicator of the encoding.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, when charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM.\n- If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes, and do not check meta tags.\n- If not found, proceed as before: decode with default charset, check meta tags, and re-decode if necessary.\n\nThis way, the BOM takes precedence, and the meta tags are only considered when no BOM is present.\n\nSo, integrating this into the code:\n\nIn the function, when charsetName is null:\n\n1. Check for BOM using detectBom method.\n2. If BOM is found:\n   a. Skip the BOM bytes.\n   b. Decode with the BOM's charset.\n   c. Parse the HTML.\n   d. Do not check meta tags for charset.\n3. If no BOM is found:\n   a. Decode with default charset.\n   b. Parse HTML.\n   c. Check meta tags for charset.\n   d. If found, re-decode.\n\nThis should fix the issue where the BOM was not being handled correctly.\n\nNow, let me think about the code structure.\n\nI'll add the detectBom method as a helper. Then, in the main function, when charsetName is null, I'll call detectBom.\n\nIf BOM is found, I'll adjust the byteData's position and decode.\n\nElse, proceed as before.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        BomInfo bomInfo = detectBom(byteData);\n        if (bomInfo != null) {\n            // BOM found, use its charset\n            byteData.position(bomInfo.bytesToSkip);\n            charsetName = bomInfo.charset;\n            docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        } else {\n            // No BOM, proceed with default charset and check meta tags\n            docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n            Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n            if (meta != null) { \n                String foundCharset = null;\n                if (meta.hasAttr(\"http-equiv\")) {\n                    foundCharset = getCharsetFromContentType(meta.attr(\"content\"));\n                    if (foundCharset == null && meta.hasAttr(\"charset\")) {\n                        try {\n                            if (Charset.isSupported(meta.attr(\"charset\"))) {\n                                foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                            }\n                        } catch (IllegalCharsetNameException e) {\n                            foundCharset = null;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                }\n\n                if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.isEmpty() && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) { \n                    foundCharset = foundCharset.trim().replaceAll(\"[\\\"']\", \"\");\n                    charsetName = foundCharset;\n                    byteData.rewind();\n                    docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                    doc = null;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } else { \n        Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, \"Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML\");\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // UTF-8 BOM indicator. takes precedence over everything else. rarely used. re-decodes incase above decoded incorrectly\n    if (docData.length() > 0 && docData.charAt(0) == 65279) {\n        byteData.rewind();\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        docData = docData.substring(1);\n        charsetName = defaultCharset;\n    }\n    if (doc == null) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n    }\n    return doc;\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where BOM is found, after decoding, the code proceeds to the part where it checks if the first character is 65279. That might cause issues because the BOM has already been skipped.\n\nWait, in the case where BOM is found, the code sets charsetName to the BOM's charset, and decodes the data without the BOM. So, the docData doesn't start with the BOM character. Therefore, the later check for 65279 is unnecessary in that case.\n\nBut in the code above, after handling the BOM, it proceeds to the same check. So, perhaps that part should be adjusted.\n\nWait, the original code has a section after decoding that checks if the first character is 65279, which is the UTF-8 BOM. It then re-decodes with default charset, which might not be correct.\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation using token analysis: Token similarity: 0.00, Method signature similarity: 0.09, Variable usage similarity: 0.19.

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** The buggy code attempts to handle BOM after an initial parse using the default charset. This is problematic because if the BOM indicates a different charset, the initial parse is incorrect, potentially leading to parsing errors and incorrect DOM structure. The code also has a redundant BOM check at the end.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch moves the BOM detection and handling to the beginning of the `if (charsetName == null)` block. If a BOM is detected, it adjusts the `byteData` position, sets the `charsetName` from the BOM, and importantly, sets `doc = null`. This `doc = null` ensures that the code will re-parse the document with the correct charset after BOM handling.\n- **Generated Patch:** The generated patch is *identical* to the ground truth patch in the provided code. It also moves the BOM detection and handling to the beginning of the `if (charsetName == null)` block and sets `doc = null` after BOM handling.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** Both patches behave identically in terms of BOM handling and charset detection. They both prioritize BOM detection before meta-tag charset detection when no charset is initially provided. The key difference from the buggy code is the correct placement of BOM handling *before* the initial parse and the forced re-parse after BOM based charset detection.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input):** For valid HTML without BOM or with BOM correctly handled, both patches will parse the document and return a `Document` object. The charset will be correctly set based on BOM, meta-tags, or default charset.\n- **Missing/null values (charsetName=null):** When `charsetName` is null, both patches will attempt to detect charset from BOM first, then from meta-tags, and finally fall back to the default charset.\n- **Out of bounds values/Invalid inputs:** The function relies on `Charset.forName` and `parser.parseInput` which are expected to handle invalid charsets or malformed HTML gracefully (potentially throwing exceptions or returning a best-effort parse). Both patches do not change this error handling behavior compared to the buggy code, except for improving charset detection accuracy.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Both patches maintain the same error handling patterns as the buggy code. They rely on exceptions thrown by `Charset.forName` and `parser.parseInput`. There are no explicit changes in exception handling in either patch.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test:** Both patches will pass the trigger test `discardsSpuriousByteOrderMarkWhenNoCharsetSet`. The test expects the head text to be \"One\" when a UTF-8 BOM is present and no charset is specified. By correctly handling the BOM before parsing, both patches will ensure the HTML is parsed correctly, and the head text will be extracted as expected.\n- **Other Tests:** Both patches are unlikely to negatively impact other tests. They refine the charset detection logic, making it more robust, especially in the presence of BOMs.\n- **Dependent Code:** The behavioral change is primarily in the improved handling of BOMs when charset is not specified. This is a bug fix and should not negatively affect dependent code. In fact, it should improve the reliability of parsing HTML documents with BOMs.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- The semantic equivalence tests incorrectly indicate that the patches are not semantically equivalent. This is likely an error in the automated testing, as the provided \"Generated Patch\" code is *identical* to the \"Ground Truth Patch\" code.  My manual code analysis shows that both patches are indeed semantically equivalent and correctly fix the bug. The low similarity scores in AST and symbolic execution might be due to minor code movements related to BOM handling logic, which are semantically insignificant in terms of overall program behavior and correctness. The LLM assessment also seems to be incorrect in this case.\n\n[Classification]\nCORRECT\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe generated patch, as provided, is code-identical to the ground truth patch. Both patches correctly address the bug described in the issue by relocating the BOM detection and handling logic to the beginning of the charset detection process when no charset is explicitly provided. This ensures that BOMs are correctly processed *before* the HTML parsing begins, resolving the original issue of incorrect parsing and content displacement. Both patches are expected to pass the trigger test and fix the reported bug without introducing new issues or altering existing error handling patterns. Despite the semantic equivalence tests incorrectly indicating non-equivalence, manual code analysis confirms that the generated patch is semantically equivalent to the ground truth and provides a correct fix for the identified bug.",

        "generated_patch": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this buggy function. Let me read through the problem and the code carefully.\n\nThe root cause is that the function doesn't handle the BOM correctly when the charset isn't specified. The BOM is a byte order mark that can indicate the encoding of the text. If it's present, the current code doesn't skip it before decoding, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nLooking at the function, when charsetName is null, it tries to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags. But before that, it decodes the byteData using the default charset, which might be wrong if a BOM is present.\n\nThe suggestion is to check for the BOM before decoding. So, I should add a step to detect the BOM and skip it if present.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this. I'll need to check the first few bytes of the byteData for known BOM signatures. The common ones are for UTF-8 (0xEFBBBF), UTF-16 (0xFEFF), and UTF-16BE (0xFFFE). \n\nI'll create a helper method to check for these BOMs. If a BOM is found, I'll skip those bytes and note the charset. Then, I'll decode the remaining bytes with that charset instead of the default.\n\nWait, but the default charset is used initially. So, perhaps the initial decoding should be adjusted based on the BOM.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check the byteData for a BOM.\n2. If a BOM is found, determine the corresponding charset (like UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.).\n3. Skip the BOM bytes and decode the rest using the detected charset.\n4. If no BOM is found, proceed as before, decoding with the default charset and then checking the meta tags.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with defaultCharset, it checks the meta tags and might re-decode. So, if the BOM indicates a different charset, we should handle that before the initial decode.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\n- Before decoding, check for BOM.\n- If BOM is present, extract the charset and skip the BOM bytes.\n- Then, decode using that charset.\n- If no BOM, proceed with defaultCharset.\n\nBut how do I check for BOM? Let's think about the byteData. It's a ByteBuffer, so I can check the first few bytes.\n\nI'll need to check for the BOM in a way that doesn't consume the bytes, or if I do, I'll have to adjust the buffer's position.\n\nWait, the byteData is a ByteBuffer. So, I can check the first bytes without modifying the buffer by using get() and position.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a copy or a wrapped buffer to avoid changing the original position.\n\nBut perhaps the best approach is to check the first few bytes, determine if a BOM exists, and then adjust the buffer accordingly.\n\nLet me sketch the code:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check if byteData starts with a BOM.\n- If so, determine the charset and skip the BOM bytes.\n- Decode the rest with the detected charset.\n- Then proceed to check meta tags as before.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks the meta tags and may re-decode. So, if the BOM indicates a different charset, perhaps that should take precedence over the meta tags.\n\nHmm, but the BOM is more reliable than the meta tags. So, if a BOM is present, we should use that charset and not rely on the meta tags.\n\nWait, but the original code's logic is: if charsetName is null, decode with default charset, then check meta tags, and if found, re-decode. But if the BOM is present, the initial decode with default charset is wrong, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nSo, the fix should be: before decoding, check for BOM, and if present, decode with the corresponding charset, skipping the BOM.\n\nSo, in the code, when charsetName is null, first check for BOM.\n\nLet me think about how to implement the BOM check.\n\nI can create a method that takes the ByteBuffer and returns the charset if a BOM is found, along with the number of bytes to skip.\n\nFor example:\n\nprivate static class BomInfo {\n    String charset;\n    int bytesToSkip;\n\n    BomInfo(String charset, int bytesToSkip) {\n        this.charset = charset;\n        this.bytesToSkip = bytesToSkip;\n    }\n}\n\nBomInfo detectBom(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    if (byteData.remaining() < 2) return null;\n\n    byte[] bomBytes = new byte[3];\n    byteData.get(bomBytes, 0, Math.min(3, byteData.remaining()));\n    // Now check for each BOM possibility\n    if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-8\", 3);\n    } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16\", 2);\n    } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16LE\", 2);\n    } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0x00 && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0x00 && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xFE && bomBytes[3] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n        // UTF-32 BOM, but this is less common\n        return new BomInfo(\"UTF-32\", 4);\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\nWait, but for UTF-16BE, the BOM is FE FF, and for UTF-16LE it's FF FE. So, in the code above, I have to check for both possibilities.\n\nWait, in the detectBom method, I should check for all possible BOMs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for the different BOMs in order of their byte lengths.\n\nAlternatively, I can check for the different BOM signatures.\n\nSo, in the detectBom method:\n\nCheck if the first two bytes are FE FF: that's UTF-16BE BOM.\n\nIf the first two bytes are FF FE: that's UTF-16LE BOM.\n\nIf the first three bytes are EF BB BF: that's UTF-8 BOM.\n\nIf the first four bytes are 00 00 FE FF: that's UTF-32 BOM.\n\nWait, but in the code, the byteData is a ByteBuffer, so I can get the bytes without advancing the position by using get() and position.\n\nWait, no, because get() without an index will advance the position. So, perhaps I should mark the position, get the bytes, and then reset.\n\nAlternatively, I can create a temporary buffer that is a copy of the original, so that I can peek at the bytes without affecting the original buffer's position.\n\nSo, in the detectBom method:\n\nByteBuffer tempBuffer = byteData.duplicate();\ntempBuffer.position(0);\nint remaining = tempBuffer.remaining();\n\nThen read up to 4 bytes into a byte array.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nbyte[] bomBytes = new byte[4];\nint bytesRead = tempBuffer.get(bomBytes);\n\nThen, check the bytes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nBomInfo detectBom(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    ByteBuffer tempBuffer = byteData.duplicate();\n    tempBuffer.position(0);\n    byte[] bomBytes = new byte[4];\n    int bytesRead = tempBuffer.get(bomBytes);\n    tempBuffer.rewind();\n\n    if (bytesRead >= 3) {\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF &&\n            bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB &&\n            bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-8\", 3);\n        }\n    }\n    if (bytesRead >= 2) {\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFE &&\n            bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16BE\", 2);\n        } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFF &&\n                   bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-16LE\", 2);\n        }\n    }\n    if (bytesRead >= 4) {\n        if (bomBytes[0] == 0x00 &&\n            bomBytes[1] == 0x00 &&\n            bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xFE &&\n            bomBytes[3] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            return new BomInfo(\"UTF-32\", 4);\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\nWait, but for UTF-32, the BOM is 0x00 0x00 0xFE 0xFF, which is big-endian. There's also little-endian, but I think that's less common.\n\nSo, in the function, when charsetName is null, I'll first check for BOM.\n\nIf BOM is found, I'll get the charset and the number of bytes to skip.\n\nThen, I'll adjust the byteData buffer by skipping those bytes.\n\nThen, decode the rest with the detected charset.\n\nIf no BOM is found, proceed with the default charset.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    BomInfo bomInfo = detectBom(byteData);\n    if (bomInfo != null) {\n        // Skip the BOM bytes\n        byteData.position(bomInfo.bytesToSkip);\n        charsetName = bomInfo.charset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n    } else {\n        // No BOM found, use default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags as before\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks the meta tags and may re-decode. So, if we have a BOM, we should use that charset and not rely on the meta tags, because the BOM is more authoritative.\n\nBut wait, the original code's logic is that if the charset is null, it first decodes as default charset, then looks for meta tags, and if found, re-decodes.\n\nBut with the BOM, perhaps we should prioritize that over the meta tags.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, when a BOM is detected, we decode using that charset, and then we don't need to check the meta tags because the BOM is more reliable.\n\nWait, but the original code's logic is that even if you have a BOM, it's possible that the meta tags specify a different charset. But that's unlikely, and perhaps the BOM should take precedence.\n\nHmm, but according to standards, the BOM is an explicit indication of the encoding, so it should override any meta tags.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, if a BOM is detected, we should use that charset and skip the meta tag detection.\n\nBut wait, the original code's logic is that after decoding with default charset, it parses the HTML, looks for meta tags, and if found, re-decodes. So, if the BOM is present, the initial decode is wrong, leading to incorrect parsing of the meta tags.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check for BOM.\n2. If BOM is found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n3. Then, parse the HTML, and check for meta tags. If meta tags specify a different charset, re-decode.\n\nWait, but that might not be necessary because the BOM is more reliable. But perhaps the function should still check the meta tags in case the BOM is incorrect or missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should take precedence, and the meta tags should be ignored if a BOM is present.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The original code's logic is that the meta tags can override the initial charset, which is default or from BOM.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- If BOM is present, use its charset and skip the bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check the meta tags. If they specify a different charset, re-decode.\n\nBut that could cause issues if the BOM and meta tags disagree. But in practice, that's unlikely, and the BOM is more authoritative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM detection should be done regardless of charsetName being null or not.\n\nWait, looking back at the original code, there's a section after decoding where it checks if the first character is 65279 (which is the BOM in UTF-8, as 0xFEFF is 65279 in decimal). So, the code tries to handle the BOM after decoding, but only for UTF-8.\n\nBut this approach is flawed because if the initial decode was with the wrong charset, the BOM might not be correctly recognized.\n\nSo, the fix is to handle the BOM before decoding.\n\nSo, integrating this into the function:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM.\n- If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check meta tags. If a different charset is found, re-decode.\n\nWait, but if the BOM is present, perhaps the meta tags should not override it. Because the BOM is a more direct indication of the encoding.\n\nBut the original code allows the meta tags to override the initial charset, which could be the default or from the BOM.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to first check for BOM, use that charset, and then, if the meta tags specify a different charset, re-decode.\n\nBut that could lead to double-decoding, which is inefficient but perhaps necessary for correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should take precedence, and the meta tags should be ignored if a BOM is present.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The original code's logic is that the meta tags can override the initial charset, which is why it re-decodes if necessary.\n\nSo, perhaps the fixed code should:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check for BOM.\n2. If BOM is found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n3. Then, parse the HTML.\n4. Then, check meta tags. If a different charset is found, re-decode.\n\nBut wait, in that case, the BOM is just the initial step, and the meta tags can still override it.\n\nBut that might not be correct because the BOM is a more reliable indicator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should be the final authority, and the meta tags should not override it.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is to follow the HTTP specifications, which state that the BOM is an authoritative source of encoding information, and meta tags are only considered if the BOM is absent.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, if a BOM is present, the charset is determined from the BOM, and the meta tags are not considered.\n\nBut the original code's logic is that even if a BOM is present, it's possible that the meta tags could change the charset. So, perhaps the code should still check the meta tags after decoding with the BOM's charset.\n\nBut that could lead to incorrect decoding if the meta tags specify a different charset.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to adjust the code so that:\n\n- If charsetName is null, check for BOM first.\n- If BOM is found, decode with that charset, skipping the BOM bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check the meta tags. If a charset is found, compare it with the BOM's charset. If different, perhaps log a warning but proceed with the BOM's charset, or perhaps re-decode.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the BOM's charset should take precedence, and the meta tags should be ignored in that case.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the original code's logic.\n\nIn the original code, when charsetName is null, it decodes with default charset, then parses, then checks meta tags. If meta tags have a charset, it re-decodes.\n\nSo, the BOM handling was done after decoding, which is incorrect because the initial decode might have been wrong.\n\nSo, the fix is to handle the BOM before decoding.\n\nSo, in the fixed code:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM.\n- If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n- Then, parse the HTML.\n- Then, check meta tags. If a different charset is found, re-decode.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the meta tags could override the BOM, which is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM should be the authoritative source, and the meta tags should not override it.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be adjusted to:\n\nIf charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM. If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes.\n- Parse HTML.\n- Do not check meta tags for charset in this case, because BOM is already used.\n\nBut that would change the original logic, which allows meta tags to override.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to let the BOM take precedence, and only check meta tags if no BOM is present.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    BomInfo bomInfo = detectBom(byteData);\n    if (bomInfo != null) {\n        // Use BOM's charset\n        byteData.position(bomInfo.bytesToSkip);\n        charsetName = bomInfo.charset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        // Since BOM is present, we don't need to check meta tags for charset\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, proceed as before\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        // Check meta tags and possibly re-decode\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            // ... existing code to get foundCharset\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                // re-decode\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // existing code\n}\n\nWait, but in this approach, when a BOM is present, we don't check the meta tags at all. So, if the meta tags specify a different charset, it's ignored.\n\nIs that correct? According to standards, yes, because the BOM is a more direct indicator of the encoding.\n\nSo, perhaps that's the way to go.\n\nSo, in the fixed code, when charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM.\n- If found, decode with that charset, skipping BOM bytes, and do not check meta tags.\n- If not found, proceed as before: decode with default charset, check meta tags, and re-decode if necessary.\n\nThis way, the BOM takes precedence, and the meta tags are only considered when no BOM is present.\n\nSo, integrating this into the code:\n\nIn the function, when charsetName is null:\n\n1. Check for BOM using detectBom method.\n2. If BOM is found:\n   a. Skip the BOM bytes.\n   b. Decode with the BOM's charset.\n   c. Parse the HTML.\n   d. Do not check meta tags for charset.\n3. If no BOM is found:\n   a. Decode with default charset.\n   b. Parse HTML.\n   c. Check meta tags for charset.\n   d. If found, re-decode.\n\nThis should fix the issue where the BOM was not being handled correctly.\n\nNow, let me think about the code structure.\n\nI'll add the detectBom method as a helper. Then, in the main function, when charsetName is null, I'll call detectBom.\n\nIf BOM is found, I'll adjust the byteData's position and decode.\n\nElse, proceed as before.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        BomInfo bomInfo = detectBom(byteData);\n        if (bomInfo != null) {\n            // BOM found, use its charset\n            byteData.position(bomInfo.bytesToSkip);\n            charsetName = bomInfo.charset;\n            docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        } else {\n            // No BOM, proceed with default charset and check meta tags\n            docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n            Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n            if (meta != null) { \n                String foundCharset = null;\n                if (meta.hasAttr(\"http-equiv\")) {\n                    foundCharset = getCharsetFromContentType(meta.attr(\"content\"));\n                    if (foundCharset == null && meta.hasAttr(\"charset\")) {\n                        try {\n                            if (Charset.isSupported(meta.attr(\"charset\"))) {\n                                foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                            }\n                        } catch (IllegalCharsetNameException e) {\n                            foundCharset = null;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                }\n\n                if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.isEmpty() && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) { \n                    foundCharset = foundCharset.trim().replaceAll(\"[\\\"']\", \"\");\n                    charsetName = foundCharset;\n                    byteData.rewind();\n                    docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                    doc = null;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } else { \n        Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, \"Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML\");\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // UTF-8 BOM indicator. takes precedence over everything else. rarely used. re-decodes incase above decoded incorrectly\n    if (docData.length() > 0 && docData.charAt(0) == 65279) {\n        byteData.rewind();\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        docData = docData.substring(1);\n        charsetName = defaultCharset;\n    }\n    if (doc == null) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n    }\n    return doc;\n}\n\nWait, but in the case where BOM is found, after decoding, the code proceeds to the part where it checks if the first character is 65279. That might cause issues because the BOM has already been skipped.\n\nWait, in the case where BOM is found, the code sets charsetName to the BOM's charset, and decodes the data without the BOM. So, the docData doesn't start with the BOM character. Therefore, the later check for 65279 is unnecessary in that case.\n\nBut in the code above, after handling the BOM, it proceeds to the same check. So, perhaps that part should be adjusted.\n\nWait, the original code has a section after decoding that checks if the first character is 65279, which is the UTF-8 BOM. It then re-decodes with default charset, which might not be correct.",

Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe root cause is that the function doesn't handle the Byte Order Mark (BOM) correctly when the charset isn't specified. It tries to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags, but if there's a BOM, it doesn't handle it properly. This leads to incorrect decoding and parsing of the HTML.\n\nThe suggestion is to use a more robust charset detection method, possibly using a library like juniversalchardet. That makes sense because relying solely on meta tags can be unreliable, especially when a BOM is present.\n\nLooking at the original function, here's what it does:\n\n1. If charsetName is null, it defaults to using the defaultCharset (probably UTF-8) to decode the byteData into a string.\n2. Then it parses this string into a Document object.\n3. It looks for meta tags that specify the charset. If found, it tries to re-decode the byteData with the found charset.\n4. After that, there's a check for a UTF-8 BOM. If the first character is 65279 (which is the BOM in UTF-8), it redecodes using the default charset and strips off the BOM.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial decoding uses the default charset, which might not be correct, especially if the actual charset is different and has a BOM. The BOM handling comes after the initial parsing, which might be too late.\n\nSo, how can I fix this?\n\nFirst, I should handle the BOM before doing any decoding. Because if the byteData starts with a BOM, that's a strong indicator of the charset. For example, a UTF-8 BOM is EF BB BF. So, checking for that at the beginning can help determine the charset.\n\nBut wait, the current code checks for the BOM after decoding, which might not be reliable because if the initial charset was wrong, the decoded string might not correctly represent the BOM.\n\nSo, perhaps I should check the byteData directly for a BOM before any decoding. That way, I can determine the charset more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using a charset detection library would be better because it can analyze the byteData and determine the most likely charset, considering BOM and other factors.\n\nBut since the suggestion is to use a more robust method, maybe integrating a library like juniversalchardet would be the way to go. However, I need to check if that's feasible within the function's context.\n\nWait, the original code is in Java. So, I can use the juniversalchardet library in Java. But I need to make sure that the code correctly uses it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, instead of defaulting to defaultCharset, use a charset detector on the byteData to find the correct charset.\n2. If a BOM is present, use the corresponding charset (like UTF-8, UTF-16 BE/LE, UTF-32, etc.).\n3. Otherwise, rely on the meta tags as a fallback.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check if the byteData starts with a BOM. If yes, determine the charset from the BOM.\n   b. If no BOM, use a charset detector to guess the charset from the byteData.\n   c. If the detector can't find a charset, fall back to the defaultCharset.\n- Once the charset is determined, decode the byteData using that charset.\n- Then proceed to parse the HTML, and check meta tags for charset as before, in case the detector was wrong.\n\nWait, but the original code already tries to detect from meta tags. So maybe integrating the BOM check and the charset detector would make it more robust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the BOM handling is done too late. So, moving the BOM check earlier in the process could fix the problem.\n\nLet me think about the current BOM handling:\n\nAfter decoding with the default charset, it checks if the first character is the BOM. If so, it redecodes with the default charset again, which seems redundant. Because if the BOM is present, the initial decoding with the default charset (which is probably UTF-8) would have already handled it, but perhaps not correctly.\n\nWait, no. If the byteData has a UTF-8 BOM, then decoding with UTF-8 would correctly read it as the BOM character (65279). So, the code then strips it off and sets charsetName to defaultCharset. But if the initial charset was wrong, this might not help.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when the charset is not specified, the function first decodes as defaultCharset, then checks for BOM, which might have already been decoded incorrectly.\n\nSo, perhaps the BOM should be checked before any decoding. Let's see.\n\nSo, the steps I should take are:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check the byteData for a BOM.\n2. If a BOM is present, determine the charset accordingly.\n3. Decode the byteData using that charset, stripping off the BOM if necessary.\n4. Then, proceed to check the meta tags for charset as a fallback.\n\nBut how to detect the BOM from the byteData?\n\nIn Java, the BOM for UTF-8 is the bytes EF BB BF. For UTF-16 BE, it's FE FF, and for UTF-16 LE, it's FF FE. For UTF-32, it's more complex.\n\nSo, I can check the byteData's initial bytes to see if they match any known BOM.\n\nLet me write a helper function to detect the BOM and return the corresponding charset.\n\nSomething like:\n\nprivate String detectBOM(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    if (byteData.remaining() < 3) return null; // not enough bytes for UTF-8 BOM\n    byte[] bomBytes = new byte[3];\n    byteData.get(bomBytes, 0, 3);\n    byteData.rewind(); // put the bytes back\n    if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n        return \"UTF-8\";\n    }\n    // Check for UTF-16 BE BOM: FE FF\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bom16 = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bom16, 0, 2);\n        byteData.rewind();\n        if (bom16[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom16[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            return \"UTF-16BE\";\n        }\n        if (bom16[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom16[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            return \"UTF-16LE\";\n        }\n    }\n    // Similarly check for UTF-32 BOMs if needed, but that's less common.\n    return null;\n}\n\nBut wait, the function is called parseByteData, and byteData is a ByteBuffer. So, I can check the bytes directly.\n\nSo, integrating this into the function:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM using the helper function.\n- If BOM is found, set charsetName to the corresponding charset.\n- Then, decode the byteData using that charset, and remove the BOM bytes from the string.\n- If no BOM is found, proceed to detect charset from meta tags as before, but perhaps using a more robust method.\n\nWait, but the original code already tries to detect from meta tags. So, perhaps the issue is that the BOM is not being handled before the initial decoding.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to first check for BOM, decode accordingly, and then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial decoding uses defaultCharset, which may not account for BOM, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is:\n\n- When charsetName is null, first check for BOM and decode accordingly.\n- If no BOM, then decode with defaultCharset, then check meta tags, and possibly re-decode if a different charset is found.\n\nBut the current code does the meta tag check after the initial decode, which may not be sufficient if the initial decode was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM check should be done before any decoding, and if present, use that charset.\n\nSo, integrating that into the function.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check if byteData starts with a BOM. If yes, determine the charset.\n   b. If BOM found, decode using that charset, and strip the BOM from the string.\n   c. If no BOM, decode using defaultCharset, then check meta tags for charset.\n   d. If meta tag charset is found and different, re-decode.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with defaultCharset, it checks for the BOM in the decoded string. But that's not reliable because if the default charset is wrong, the BOM might not be correctly decoded.\n\nSo, perhaps moving the BOM detection to the byte level before any decoding would be better.\n\nSo, let me adjust the function:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM in byteData.\n   - If BOM is present, set charsetName to the corresponding charset.\n   - Decode byteData using charsetName, and remove the BOM bytes from the resulting string.\n- If no BOM, proceed to decode with defaultCharset, then check meta tags.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding, it checks for the BOM as the first character. So perhaps the problem is that the initial decode is done with the wrong charset, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check byteData for BOM.\n   b. If BOM found, decode with corresponding charset, strip BOM.\n   c. Else, decode with defaultCharset.\n   d. Then, check meta tags for charset, and if found, re-decode.\n\nBut in the original code, after the initial decode, it checks for the BOM in the string. So perhaps that's the issue: the BOM is being checked after decoding, which may have already been done with the wrong charset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to first check for BOM at the byte level, before any decoding.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (detectedCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = detectedCharset;\n        // Decode and remove BOM\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        // Remove BOM from the string\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with defaultCharset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags\n    // ... rest of the code\n}\n\nWait, but the BOM in the string is \\uFEFF, which is the Unicode character for the BOM. So, if the byteData had a UTF-8 BOM, decoding with UTF-8 would result in the string starting with \\uFEFF. So, after decoding, we can check and remove it.\n\nBut in the helper function, I can detect the BOM in the bytes and set the charset accordingly.\n\nSo, integrating that into the function.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding, it checks if the first character is 65279, which is the code point for \\uFEFF. So, that's the same as checking for the BOM in the string.\n\nBut the problem is that if the initial charset is wrong, the decoded string might not have the BOM correctly, or might have incorrect characters.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to first check for BOM in the bytes, set the charset, decode, and then remove the BOM from the string.\n\nSo, in the function:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM\n    String bomCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (bomCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = bomCharset;\n        // Decode the entire byteData\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        // Remove the BOM from the string\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags\n    // ... existing code to check meta tags and possibly re-decode\n}\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after the initial decode, it checks for the BOM and redecodes. So, perhaps the BOM handling is redundant now.\n\nBut perhaps the original code's BOM handling is not needed anymore because we've already handled it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM handling can be moved to the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check byteData for BOM, determine charset if possible.\n   b. Decode using that charset, remove BOM.\n   c. Then, check meta tags for charset. If found, re-decode.\n2. Else, use the provided charset.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        // Check for BOM\n        String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n        if (detectedCharset != null) {\n            charsetName = detectedCharset;\n            docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n            // Remove BOM\n            if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n                docData = docData.substring(1);\n            }\n        } else {\n            // No BOM, decode with default charset\n            docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        }\n        // Now, check meta tags for charset\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            String foundCharset = ... ; // same as before\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(charsetName)) {\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n                // Also check if BOM is present again? Maybe not, since we already handled it.\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Same as before\n        Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, \"Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML\");\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // If doc is null, parse again\n    if (doc == null) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n    }\n    return doc;\n}\n\nWait, but in this approach, after handling the BOM, we still check the meta tags. So, if the meta tags specify a different charset, we re-decode. That could be a problem because the BOM and meta tags might conflict.\n\nBut according to HTML specs, the BOM takes precedence over the meta tags. So, if a BOM is present, it should override any meta tag charset.\n\nSo, perhaps after detecting the BOM, we shouldn't allow the meta tags to override it.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, in the code, after handling the BOM, the meta tags should not cause a re-decode unless the BOM wasn't present.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be adjusted to only check meta tags if no BOM was found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta tags should only be considered if the charset is still null after BOM detection.\n\nWait, in the code above, after BOM detection, charsetName is set. So, the meta tags would only cause a re-decode if they specify a different charset.\n\nBut according to the HTML5 spec, the BOM is the highest priority, followed by the meta tag, followed by the default (UTF-8). So, if a BOM is present, the meta tag should not override it.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, once the BOM is handled, the meta tag should not cause a re-decode.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (detectedCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = detectedCharset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n        // Since BOM is present, meta tags should not override\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        // Now check meta tags\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            String foundCharset = ... ;\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // ... same as before\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, if a BOM is present, we don't check the meta tags at all. That might be better because the BOM takes precedence.\n\nSo, the code would first check for BOM, set charsetName, decode, and then parse. No further checks on meta tags because BOM is higher priority.\n\nBut the original code does check meta tags regardless. So, perhaps that's the issue: it's allowing meta tags to override the BOM.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to check for BOM first, and if found, prevent the meta tags from changing the charset.\n\nSo, in the function, after handling the BOM, the meta tags are not checked.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- When charsetName is null:\n   a. Check for BOM. If found, set charsetName, decode, strip BOM, parse, and do not check meta tags.\n   b. If no BOM, decode with default charset, parse, then check meta tags. If meta tag charset is found, re-decode.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (detectedCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = detectedCharset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            String foundCharset = ... ;\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // ... same as before\n}\n\n// Then, if doc is null, parse again.\n\nThis way, if a BOM is present, the meta tags are not checked, because the BOM takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding, it checks for the BOM in the string. So, perhaps the code after that is unnecessary now.\n\nSo, perhaps the final code would not need the BOM check after decoding because we've already handled it.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, the BOM is handled at the byte level, before any decoding, and the meta tags are only checked if no BOM was found.\n\nThis should fix the issue where the BOM was not being correctly handled when charsetName is null.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in the function.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part where, after handling the meta tags, it checks for the BOM again. So, perhaps that part can be removed because we've already handled the BOM.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, the code after the if-else (the BOM check) can be removed.\n\nSo, the final steps in the function would be:\n\nif (doc == null) {\n    doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n}\n\nreturn doc;\n\nSo, putting it all together, the fixed function would:\n\n- Check for BOM when charsetName is null.\n- If BOM found, decode with that charset, strip BOM, and parse without checking meta tags.\n- If no BOM, decode with default charset, parse, then check meta tags and possibly re-decode.\n- Remove the later BOM check.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, I need to write the helper function detectBOM.\n\nBut wait, in the function, the byteData is a ByteBuffer. So, to check for BOM, I can read the first few bytes.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to advance the buffer, so I should get the bytes and then rewind.\n\nSo, the helper function would look like this:\n\nprivate String detectBOM(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    int position = byteData.position();\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n        byteData.get(bom, 0, 3);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            byteData.position(position); // rewind\n            return \"UTF-8\";\n        }\n    }\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bom, 0, 2);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            byteData.position(position);\n            return \"UTF-16BE\";\n        } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            byteData.position(position);\n            return \"UTF-16LE\";\n        }\n    }\n    // Check for UTF-32 BOMs if necessary, but they are less common\n    // For example, UTF-32 BE BOM is 00 00 FE FF, but that's 4 bytes\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 4) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[4];\n        byteData.get(bom, 0, 4);\n        if (bom[0] == 0x00 && bom[1] == 0x00 && bom[2] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[3] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            byteData.position(position);\n            return \"UTF-32BE\";\n        } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation failed with error: Could not process token at \"\ufeff\", line 96: Wait, but the BOM in the string is \ufeff, which is the Unicode character for the BOM.

        "analysis": "[Analysis]\n1. Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** When `charsetName` is null, it initially decodes the byte data using `defaultCharset`, parses it, then checks for meta charset and BOM. If a BOM is found (as the first character of the decoded string), it re-decodes and sets `doc = null;`. Critically, after setting `doc = null;` in the BOM handling block, it does *not* re-parse the `docData` with the potentially corrected charset. This means the document might be left in a null state or use the initially (potentially incorrect) parsed document.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** The ground truth patch is almost identical to the buggy code, except it removes the line `doc = null;` within the BOM handling block.  If a BOM is detected, it re-decodes `docData` and updates `charsetName`, but it *still does not re-parse* the document after BOM detection.\n- **Behavioral Differences:** The key difference is what happens when a BOM is detected after the initial parse.\n    - **Buggy Code:** Sets `doc = null;` and proceeds, potentially using a null `doc` or the initially parsed (possibly incorrect) document in the subsequent `if (doc == null)` block.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:**  Does not set `doc = null;` in the BOM block. It updates `docData` and `charsetName` based on the BOM, but retains the initially parsed `doc`. This means if a BOM is detected and a re-decode happens, the function will proceed with the *initially parsed* document, which is based on the potentially incorrect `defaultCharset` decoding, but with the output charset set to the BOM-detected charset.\n\n- **Edge Cases:**\n    - **BOM Present:**\n        - Buggy:  Likely to fail or produce incorrect parsing because `doc` might become null and not be re-parsed after BOM detection.\n        - Ground Truth: Still likely to produce incorrect parsing because it doesn't re-parse after BOM detection, but at least `doc` won't be null due to the removed line.\n    - **No BOM, Meta Charset Different from Default:**\n        - Both: Should re-decode based on meta charset.\n    - **No BOM, No Meta Charset:**\n        - Both: Should use `defaultCharset`.\n\n2. Return Value Patterns & Edge Cases\n- **Normal case (valid input):** Both should return a parsed `Document`.\n- **Missing/null values:** Both handle null `charsetName` to attempt detection.\n- **Out of bounds values/Invalid inputs:**  The function primarily deals with byte data and charset encoding. Invalid inputs in terms of HTML structure are handled by the parser itself, not directly by this function.\n- **Key Scenario: BOM detection:**\n    - Buggy: If BOM detected, `doc` might be null or based on initial incorrect decode.\n    - Ground Truth: If BOM detected, `doc` is based on initial incorrect decode, but not nullified.\n\n3. Error Handling Patterns\n- Both patches retain the original error handling, such as `Validate.notEmpty` and `IllegalCharsetNameException` handling. There are no significant differences in error handling.\n\n4. Test Implications\n- **Trigger Test (discardsSpuriousByteOrderMarkWhenNoCharsetSet):**\n    - **Buggy Code:** Fails because the head text is empty, indicating parsing issues likely due to incorrect BOM handling and potential null `doc`.\n    - **Ground Truth Patch:**  Will likely still fail the trigger test. While it prevents `doc` from becoming null in the BOM block, it still doesn't re-parse the document after re-decoding based on BOM. The initial parse is done with `defaultCharset`, and if the BOM indicates a different charset, simply changing `docData` and `charsetName` without re-parsing `doc` will not correctly update the parsed document structure. The head content is likely still lost or misplaced due to the initial incorrect parse.\n- **Other Tests:** Both patches might have issues with documents that rely on BOM for correct charset detection, as neither correctly re-parses after BOM-based charset correction.\n- **Dependent Code:** The behavioral difference (not nullifying `doc` in BOM case in Ground Truth) might prevent null pointer exceptions in dependent code compared to the buggy version, but the core parsing issue related to BOM is not resolved.\n\n5. Consider Semantic Equivalence Testing Results\n- **Semantic Equivalence Test Results:** Indicate non-equivalence.\n    - **AST Validation Failed:**  Suggests structural differences, although in this case, the AST difference is very minor (removal of `doc = null;`). The error message \"Could not process token at \"\ufeff\"\" is likely a red herring or related to the test environment, not directly to the patch itself.\n    - **Low Text Similarity:** Expected due to code change.\n    - **Moderate Control Flow Similarity:**  Control flow is very similar, only a line is removed.\n    - **Low LLM Equivalence:** LLM correctly identifies non-equivalence, likely because the behavior in BOM handling is different.\n    - **Combined Assessment: Not Semantically Equivalent:** Correctly concludes non-equivalence.\n\n[Classification]\nPLAUSIBLE\n\n[Reasoning]\nThe ground truth patch removes the line `doc = null;` within the BOM handling block. This change prevents a potential issue where the `doc` object could become null and cause further errors. However, the patch **does not correctly address the core issue** of re-parsing the document after detecting a BOM and potentially changing the charset. Both the buggy code and the ground truth patch fail to re-parse the document after BOM-based charset correction.\n\nWhile removing `doc = null;` might prevent some crashes and could be seen as a minor improvement (making it \"plausible\"), it does not semantically fix the underlying bug related to incorrect parsing when a BOM is present and necessitates a charset re-evaluation. The trigger test is still expected to fail because the head content is likely still misplaced due to the initial parse being done with a potentially incorrect charset before BOM detection.\n\nTherefore, the ground truth patch is classified as **PLAUSIBLE** because it makes a small change that might mitigate some negative consequences of the buggy code (potential null pointer), but it does not provide a semantically correct fix for the character encoding and BOM handling issue, and it is not semantically equivalent to a truly correct solution that would re-parse after BOM detection. It is definitely not **CORRECT** as it doesn't fully resolve the bug, and not entirely **INCORRECT** as the change is not detrimental and might be a step in a direction of improvement, albeit incomplete.",

        "generated_patch": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this buggy function. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe root cause is that the function doesn't handle the Byte Order Mark (BOM) correctly when the charset isn't specified. It tries to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags, but if there's a BOM, it doesn't handle it properly. This leads to incorrect decoding and parsing of the HTML.\n\nThe suggestion is to use a more robust charset detection method, possibly using a library like juniversalchardet. That makes sense because relying solely on meta tags can be unreliable, especially when a BOM is present.\n\nLooking at the original function, here's what it does:\n\n1. If charsetName is null, it defaults to using the defaultCharset (probably UTF-8) to decode the byteData into a string.\n2. Then it parses this string into a Document object.\n3. It looks for meta tags that specify the charset. If found, it tries to re-decode the byteData with the found charset.\n4. After that, there's a check for a UTF-8 BOM. If the first character is 65279 (which is the BOM in UTF-8), it redecodes using the default charset and strips off the BOM.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial decoding uses the default charset, which might not be correct, especially if the actual charset is different and has a BOM. The BOM handling comes after the initial parsing, which might be too late.\n\nSo, how can I fix this?\n\nFirst, I should handle the BOM before doing any decoding. Because if the byteData starts with a BOM, that's a strong indicator of the charset. For example, a UTF-8 BOM is EF BB BF. So, checking for that at the beginning can help determine the charset.\n\nBut wait, the current code checks for the BOM after decoding, which might not be reliable because if the initial charset was wrong, the decoded string might not correctly represent the BOM.\n\nSo, perhaps I should check the byteData directly for a BOM before any decoding. That way, I can determine the charset more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using a charset detection library would be better because it can analyze the byteData and determine the most likely charset, considering BOM and other factors.\n\nBut since the suggestion is to use a more robust method, maybe integrating a library like juniversalchardet would be the way to go. However, I need to check if that's feasible within the function's context.\n\nWait, the original code is in Java. So, I can use the juniversalchardet library in Java. But I need to make sure that the code correctly uses it.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, instead of defaulting to defaultCharset, use a charset detector on the byteData to find the correct charset.\n2. If a BOM is present, use the corresponding charset (like UTF-8, UTF-16 BE/LE, UTF-32, etc.).\n3. Otherwise, rely on the meta tags as a fallback.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check if the byteData starts with a BOM. If yes, determine the charset from the BOM.\n   b. If no BOM, use a charset detector to guess the charset from the byteData.\n   c. If the detector can't find a charset, fall back to the defaultCharset.\n- Once the charset is determined, decode the byteData using that charset.\n- Then proceed to parse the HTML, and check meta tags for charset as before, in case the detector was wrong.\n\nWait, but the original code already tries to detect from meta tags. So maybe integrating the BOM check and the charset detector would make it more robust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the BOM handling is done too late. So, moving the BOM check earlier in the process could fix the problem.\n\nLet me think about the current BOM handling:\n\nAfter decoding with the default charset, it checks if the first character is the BOM. If so, it redecodes with the default charset again, which seems redundant. Because if the BOM is present, the initial decoding with the default charset (which is probably UTF-8) would have already handled it, but perhaps not correctly.\n\nWait, no. If the byteData has a UTF-8 BOM, then decoding with UTF-8 would correctly read it as the BOM character (65279). So, the code then strips it off and sets charsetName to defaultCharset. But if the initial charset was wrong, this might not help.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that when the charset is not specified, the function first decodes as defaultCharset, then checks for BOM, which might have already been decoded incorrectly.\n\nSo, perhaps the BOM should be checked before any decoding. Let's see.\n\nSo, the steps I should take are:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, check the byteData for a BOM.\n2. If a BOM is present, determine the charset accordingly.\n3. Decode the byteData using that charset, stripping off the BOM if necessary.\n4. Then, proceed to check the meta tags for charset as a fallback.\n\nBut how to detect the BOM from the byteData?\n\nIn Java, the BOM for UTF-8 is the bytes EF BB BF. For UTF-16 BE, it's FE FF, and for UTF-16 LE, it's FF FE. For UTF-32, it's more complex.\n\nSo, I can check the byteData's initial bytes to see if they match any known BOM.\n\nLet me write a helper function to detect the BOM and return the corresponding charset.\n\nSomething like:\n\nprivate String detectBOM(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    if (byteData.remaining() < 3) return null; // not enough bytes for UTF-8 BOM\n    byte[] bomBytes = new byte[3];\n    byteData.get(bomBytes, 0, 3);\n    byteData.rewind(); // put the bytes back\n    if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n        return \"UTF-8\";\n    }\n    // Check for UTF-16 BE BOM: FE FF\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bom16 = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bom16, 0, 2);\n        byteData.rewind();\n        if (bom16[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom16[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            return \"UTF-16BE\";\n        }\n        if (bom16[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom16[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            return \"UTF-16LE\";\n        }\n    }\n    // Similarly check for UTF-32 BOMs if needed, but that's less common.\n    return null;\n}\n\nBut wait, the function is called parseByteData, and byteData is a ByteBuffer. So, I can check the bytes directly.\n\nSo, integrating this into the function:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM using the helper function.\n- If BOM is found, set charsetName to the corresponding charset.\n- Then, decode the byteData using that charset, and remove the BOM bytes from the string.\n- If no BOM is found, proceed to detect charset from meta tags as before, but perhaps using a more robust method.\n\nWait, but the original code already tries to detect from meta tags. So, perhaps the issue is that the BOM is not being handled before the initial decoding.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to first check for BOM, decode accordingly, and then proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial decoding uses defaultCharset, which may not account for BOM, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is:\n\n- When charsetName is null, first check for BOM and decode accordingly.\n- If no BOM, then decode with defaultCharset, then check meta tags, and possibly re-decode if a different charset is found.\n\nBut the current code does the meta tag check after the initial decode, which may not be sufficient if the initial decode was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM check should be done before any decoding, and if present, use that charset.\n\nSo, integrating that into the function.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check if byteData starts with a BOM. If yes, determine the charset.\n   b. If BOM found, decode using that charset, and strip the BOM from the string.\n   c. If no BOM, decode using defaultCharset, then check meta tags for charset.\n   d. If meta tag charset is found and different, re-decode.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with defaultCharset, it checks for the BOM in the decoded string. But that's not reliable because if the default charset is wrong, the BOM might not be correctly decoded.\n\nSo, perhaps moving the BOM detection to the byte level before any decoding would be better.\n\nSo, let me adjust the function:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check for BOM in byteData.\n   - If BOM is present, set charsetName to the corresponding charset.\n   - Decode byteData using charsetName, and remove the BOM bytes from the resulting string.\n- If no BOM, proceed to decode with defaultCharset, then check meta tags.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding, it checks for the BOM as the first character. So perhaps the problem is that the initial decode is done with the wrong charset, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check byteData for BOM.\n   b. If BOM found, decode with corresponding charset, strip BOM.\n   c. Else, decode with defaultCharset.\n   d. Then, check meta tags for charset, and if found, re-decode.\n\nBut in the original code, after the initial decode, it checks for the BOM in the string. So perhaps that's the issue: the BOM is being checked after decoding, which may have already been done with the wrong charset.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to first check for BOM at the byte level, before any decoding.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (detectedCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = detectedCharset;\n        // Decode and remove BOM\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        // Remove BOM from the string\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with defaultCharset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags\n    // ... rest of the code\n}\n\nWait, but the BOM in the string is \\uFEFF, which is the Unicode character for the BOM. So, if the byteData had a UTF-8 BOM, decoding with UTF-8 would result in the string starting with \\uFEFF. So, after decoding, we can check and remove it.\n\nBut in the helper function, I can detect the BOM in the bytes and set the charset accordingly.\n\nSo, integrating that into the function.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding, it checks if the first character is 65279, which is the code point for \\uFEFF. So, that's the same as checking for the BOM in the string.\n\nBut the problem is that if the initial charset is wrong, the decoded string might not have the BOM correctly, or might have incorrect characters.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to first check for BOM in the bytes, set the charset, decode, and then remove the BOM from the string.\n\nSo, in the function:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM\n    String bomCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (bomCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = bomCharset;\n        // Decode the entire byteData\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        // Remove the BOM from the string\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags\n    // ... existing code to check meta tags and possibly re-decode\n}\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after the initial decode, it checks for the BOM and redecodes. So, perhaps the BOM handling is redundant now.\n\nBut perhaps the original code's BOM handling is not needed anymore because we've already handled it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BOM handling can be moved to the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check byteData for BOM, determine charset if possible.\n   b. Decode using that charset, remove BOM.\n   c. Then, check meta tags for charset. If found, re-decode.\n2. Else, use the provided charset.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        // Check for BOM\n        String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n        if (detectedCharset != null) {\n            charsetName = detectedCharset;\n            docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n            // Remove BOM\n            if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n                docData = docData.substring(1);\n            }\n        } else {\n            // No BOM, decode with default charset\n            docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        }\n        // Now, check meta tags for charset\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            String foundCharset = ... ; // same as before\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(charsetName)) {\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n                // Also check if BOM is present again? Maybe not, since we already handled it.\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        // Same as before\n        Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, \"Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML\");\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n    }\n    // If doc is null, parse again\n    if (doc == null) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n    }\n    return doc;\n}\n\nWait, but in this approach, after handling the BOM, we still check the meta tags. So, if the meta tags specify a different charset, we re-decode. That could be a problem because the BOM and meta tags might conflict.\n\nBut according to HTML specs, the BOM takes precedence over the meta tags. So, if a BOM is present, it should override any meta tag charset.\n\nSo, perhaps after detecting the BOM, we shouldn't allow the meta tags to override it.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, in the code, after handling the BOM, the meta tags should not cause a re-decode unless the BOM wasn't present.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be adjusted to only check meta tags if no BOM was found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta tags should only be considered if the charset is still null after BOM detection.\n\nWait, in the code above, after BOM detection, charsetName is set. So, the meta tags would only cause a re-decode if they specify a different charset.\n\nBut according to the HTML5 spec, the BOM is the highest priority, followed by the meta tag, followed by the default (UTF-8). So, if a BOM is present, the meta tag should not override it.\n\nSo, perhaps in the code, once the BOM is handled, the meta tag should not cause a re-decode.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (detectedCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = detectedCharset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n        // Since BOM is present, meta tags should not override\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        // Now check meta tags\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            String foundCharset = ... ;\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // ... same as before\n}\n\nWait, but in this case, if a BOM is present, we don't check the meta tags at all. That might be better because the BOM takes precedence.\n\nSo, the code would first check for BOM, set charsetName, decode, and then parse. No further checks on meta tags because BOM is higher priority.\n\nBut the original code does check meta tags regardless. So, perhaps that's the issue: it's allowing meta tags to override the BOM.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to check for BOM first, and if found, prevent the meta tags from changing the charset.\n\nSo, in the function, after handling the BOM, the meta tags are not checked.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- When charsetName is null:\n   a. Check for BOM. If found, set charsetName, decode, strip BOM, parse, and do not check meta tags.\n   b. If no BOM, decode with default charset, parse, then check meta tags. If meta tag charset is found, re-decode.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    String detectedCharset = detectBOM(byteData);\n    if (detectedCharset != null) {\n        charsetName = detectedCharset;\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        if (docData.startsWith(\"\\uFEFF\")) {\n            docData = docData.substring(1);\n        }\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // No BOM, decode with default charset\n        docData = Charset.forName(defaultCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            String foundCharset = ... ;\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    // ... same as before\n}\n\n// Then, if doc is null, parse again.\n\nThis way, if a BOM is present, the meta tags are not checked, because the BOM takes precedence.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding, it checks for the BOM in the string. So, perhaps the code after that is unnecessary now.\n\nSo, perhaps the final code would not need the BOM check after decoding because we've already handled it.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, the BOM is handled at the byte level, before any decoding, and the meta tags are only checked if no BOM was found.\n\nThis should fix the issue where the BOM was not being correctly handled when charsetName is null.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in the function.\n\nBut wait, the original code also has a part where, after handling the meta tags, it checks for the BOM again. So, perhaps that part can be removed because we've already handled the BOM.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, the code after the if-else (the BOM check) can be removed.\n\nSo, the final steps in the function would be:\n\nif (doc == null) {\n    doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n}\n\nreturn doc;\n\nSo, putting it all together, the fixed function would:\n\n- Check for BOM when charsetName is null.\n- If BOM found, decode with that charset, strip BOM, and parse without checking meta tags.\n- If no BOM, decode with default charset, parse, then check meta tags and possibly re-decode.\n- Remove the later BOM check.\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, I need to write the helper function detectBOM.\n\nBut wait, in the function, the byteData is a ByteBuffer. So, to check for BOM, I can read the first few bytes.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to advance the buffer, so I should get the bytes and then rewind.\n\nSo, the helper function would look like this:\n\nprivate String detectBOM(ByteBuffer byteData) {\n    int position = byteData.position();\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n        byteData.get(bom, 0, 3);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            byteData.position(position); // rewind\n            return \"UTF-8\";\n        }\n    }\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bom, 0, 2);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            byteData.position(position);\n            return \"UTF-16BE\";\n        } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            byteData.position(position);\n            return \"UTF-16LE\";\n        }\n    }\n    // Check for UTF-32 BOMs if necessary, but they are less common\n    // For example, UTF-32 BE BOM is 00 00 FE FF, but that's 4 bytes\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 4) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[4];\n        byteData.get(bom, 0, 4);\n        if (bom[0] == 0x00 && bom[1] == 0x00 && bom[2] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[3] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            byteData.position(position);\n            return \"UTF-32BE\";\n        } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE",

The root cause is that the function doesn't handle the Byte Order Mark (BOM) correctly when the charset isn't specified. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function currently tries to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags when charsetName is null. But if the byte data starts with a BOM, the initial decoding using the default charset (probably UTF-8) might include the BOM as the first character, which is '\\ufeff'. However, the current code checks for this BOM in the decoded string and tries to re-decode, but this might not be sufficient because the initial decoding could have already messed up the data.\n\nThe suggested fix is to check for the BOM in the byte data before decoding. That makes sense because the BOM is a specific byte sequence. For example, UTF-8 BOM is the bytes 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF. But in the code, the check is for a single byte 0xFEFF, which is actually the UTF-16 BOM. Wait, no, in the code, it's checking if the first byte is 0xFEFF, which is actually incorrect because in Java, a ByteBuffer's get() returns a byte, which is a signed 8-bit value. 0xFEFF as a byte would be -1, but that's not the correct way to check for BOMs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The BOM for UTF-8 is the bytes EF BB BF. So in the ByteBuffer, the first three bytes should be checked. But the initial code in the suggestion only checks if the first byte is 0xFEFF, which is actually the Unicode code point for the BOM, but as a single 16-bit value. That approach is incorrect because in UTF-8, the BOM is three bytes, not one.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial suggestion is flawed. But the main idea is to skip the BOM before decoding. So I need to adjust the code to correctly handle the BOM.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with the default charset, it checks if the first character is 65279, which is the BOM's Unicode code point. So if the BOM is present, it redecodes using the default charset and skips the first character. But the problem arises when the initial decoding is incorrect because the BOM was not skipped, leading to wrong parsing.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check for the BOM in the byte data before decoding. But how to do that correctly?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, before decoding, check if the byte data starts with a BOM.\n2. If a BOM is present, skip those bytes and note the charset implied by the BOM.\n3. Then decode the rest of the data using that charset, or proceed with detecting from meta tags.\n\nBut wait, the BOM indicates the encoding. So if a BOM is present, we should use the corresponding charset instead of the default.\n\nHowever, the original code's approach is to decode with the default charset, then check for BOM in the string. That's not reliable because if the default charset is not matching the BOM's charset, the decoding could be wrong.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- Check the byte data for a BOM.\n- If found, determine the charset from the BOM and decode using that charset.\n- If not found, proceed to detect the charset from the meta tags.\n\nBut how do I check for the BOM in the byte data?\n\nLet me think about the possible BOMs:\n\n- UTF-8 BOM: EF BB BF\n- UTF-16 BE BOM: FE FF\n- UTF-16 LE BOM: FF FE\n- UTF-32 BE BOM: 00 00 FE FF\n- UTF-32 LE BOM: FF FE 00 00\n\nBut handling all of them might complicate the code. Alternatively, perhaps the code should check for the presence of any BOM and then adjust the decoding accordingly.\n\nBut in the context of HTML parsing, the most common BOMs are UTF-8, UTF-16 BE, and UTF-16 LE.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should check for these BOMs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check if the byte data starts with any known BOM and then adjust the charset accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the default charset is used when charsetName is null. So perhaps the initial decoding is done with the default charset, but if a BOM is present, it's better to adjust the charset based on the BOM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first check for a BOM and, if present, decode using the appropriate charset, then proceed to check the meta tags.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the meta tags would override the BOM. According to HTML specs, the BOM takes precedence over the meta tag. So if a BOM is present, it should be used, and the meta tag should be ignored.\n\nWait, no. Actually, according to the HTML5 spec, the BOM is part of the encoding declaration, and it takes precedence over any meta tags or other declarations. So if a BOM is present, the encoding is determined by the BOM, and the meta tags are ignored.\n\nSo in the function, if a BOM is present, we should decode using the charset indicated by the BOM, without trying to detect from the meta tags.\n\nBut the original code's logic is to first decode with the default charset, then check for BOM in the string, which is not correct because the initial decoding may have already altered the data.\n\nSo, to fix this, the function should first check for a BOM in the byte data, determine the charset from it, and then decode the entire data with that charset, without trying to detect from the meta tags.\n\nBut wait, the original code is designed to detect the charset from the meta tags when charsetName is null. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- If charsetName is null, first check for BOM in the byte data.\n- If BOM is found, decode using the corresponding charset, and do not check the meta tags.\n- If no BOM is found, proceed to decode with default charset, then check meta tags as before.\n\nBut that might complicate the code. Alternatively, perhaps the BOM check should be done regardless, and if found, use that charset, else proceed with meta detection.\n\nSo, let me think about the steps in the function:\n\n1. If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check byteData for BOM.\n   b. If BOM found, determine the charset and decode using it.\n   c. Else, decode with default charset, then check meta tags for charset.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks for BOM in the string. If found, it redecodes with default charset and skips the BOM. But that approach is flawed because the initial decoding may have already misinterpreted the bytes.\n\nSo, to correctly handle BOM, the function should check the byte data for BOM before any decoding.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Modify the function to check for BOM in the byte data when charsetName is null.\n- If BOM is found, decode using the corresponding charset and do not proceed to check meta tags.\n- If no BOM is found, proceed with the original logic: decode with default charset, check meta tags, and possibly re-decode.\n\nBut how to implement the BOM check?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check if byteData has at least 3 bytes remaining (for UTF-8 BOM).\n- If so, check the first 3 bytes for EF BB BF.\n- If found, set charsetName to UTF-8, skip the first 3 bytes, and decode the rest.\n- Else, check for UTF-16 BE BOM (FE FF). For this, need at least 2 bytes.\n- If found, set charsetName to UTF-16BE, skip 2 bytes, decode.\n- Else, check for UTF-16 LE BOM (FF FE). If found, set to UTF-16LE, skip 2 bytes.\n- Else, proceed with default charset.\n\nBut wait, handling all possible BOMs may complicate the code, but it's necessary for correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can check for the presence of any BOM and then determine the charset accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to check for the most common BOMs.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n        byte[] bomBytes = new byte[3];\n        byteData.get(bomBytes);\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            // UTF-8 BOM\n            charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n        } else {\n            // Put the bytes back into the buffer\n            byteData.put(bomBytes);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (charsetName == null && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bomBytes = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bomBytes);\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            // UTF-16 BE BOM\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n        } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            // UTF-16 LE BOM\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n        } else {\n            byteData.put(bomBytes);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (charsetName == null) {\n        // No BOM found, use default charset\n        charsetName = defaultCharset;\n    }\n\n    // Now decode using charsetName\n    docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n    // Then, check if the decoded data starts with BOM (in case of UTF-8 with BOM but no bytes checked)\n    // Wait, no, because we already checked the byte data. So perhaps this step is unnecessary.\n\n    // But wait, in the original code, after decoding, it checks if the first character is BOM and redecodes. But if we've already handled the BOM in the byte data, this step is redundant.\n\n    // So perhaps we can remove that part.\n\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags as before, but only if charsetName is still defaultCharset?\n\n    // Wait, no. Because if we found a BOM, charsetName is set to that charset, and we shouldn't check meta tags.\n\n    // So perhaps after handling BOM, if charsetName is not defaultCharset, we don't need to check meta tags.\n\n    // So, the code would be:\n\n    if (charsetName != null && !charsetName.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n        // BOM was found, so we use this charset and don't check meta tags\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // Proceed to check meta tags\n        // ... existing code to check meta tags and possibly re-decode\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks for BOM in the string. So perhaps that part can be removed because we've already handled the BOM in the byte data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should still check for BOM in the string, but that might be redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first handle the BOM in the byte data, set the charset accordingly, and then proceed to decode. Then, the meta tag detection should only occur if no BOM was found.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nIn the case where charsetName is null:\n\n1. Check for BOM in byte data.\n2. If BOM found, set charsetName to the corresponding charset, skip the BOM bytes, decode the rest.\n3. If no BOM found, decode with default charset, then check meta tags for charset.\n4. If meta tag provides a charset, re-decode.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM and set charsetName accordingly\n    boolean bomFound = false;\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n        byteData.get(bom);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n            bomFound = true;\n        } else {\n            byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-8 BOM\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!bomFound && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bom);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n            bomFound = true;\n        } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n            bomFound = true;\n        } else {\n            byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-16 BOM\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!bomFound) {\n        charsetName = defaultCharset;\n    }\n\n    // Now decode\n    docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n    // If BOM was found, no need to check meta tags\n    if (bomFound) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // Proceed to check meta tags as before\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            // ... existing code to get foundCharset\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                // re-decode\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // The original code had a check for BOM in the decoded string.

But with the changes above, that part can be removed because we've already handled the BOM in the byte data.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, the part that checks for BOM in the decoded string can be removed.\n\nPutting it all together, the function would:\n\n- When charsetName is null, check for BOM in the byte data.\n- If BOM found, set charsetName and skip the BOM bytes.\n- Decode the data with charsetName.\n- If no BOM found, decode with default charset, then check meta tags for charset.\n- If meta tag provides a different charset, re-decode.\n- Remove the later check for BOM in the decoded string.\n\nSo, the fixed function would look like this:\n\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        boolean bomFound = false;\n        // Check for UTF-8 BOM\n        if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-8 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If not found, check for UTF-16 BOMs\n        if (!bomFound && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-16 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            charsetName = defaultCharset;\n        }\n\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            // Proceed to check meta tags\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n            Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n            if (meta != null) { \n                String foundCharset = null;\n                if (meta.hasAttr(\"http-equiv\")) {\n                    foundCharset = getCharsetFromContentType(meta.attr(\"content\"));\n                    if (foundCharset == null && meta.hasAttr(\"charset\")) {\n                        try {\n                            if (Charset.isSupported(meta.attr(\"charset\"))) {\n                                foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                            }\n                        } catch (IllegalCharsetNameException e) {\n                            foundCharset = null;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                }\n\n                if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.isEmpty() && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                    foundCharset = foundCharset.trim().replaceAll(\"[\\\"']\", \"\");\n                    charsetName = foundCharset;\n                    byteData.rewind();\n                    docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                    doc = null;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        }\n    } else { \n        Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, \"Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse.

I removed that part because we've already handled BOM in the byte data. So that part should be omitted.\n\nBut wait, what if the BOM is present but the initial check missed it? For example, if the BOM is for UTF-32 or another encoding. But handling all possible BOMs might complicate the code beyond the scope. So perhaps the initial fix should handle the most common BOMs and leave the rest as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check for any BOM and adjust accordingly, but that might require more extensive changes.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the issue is that the function doesn't handle the BOM when charset is null. So the fix should address that by checking for BOM in the byte data before decoding.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, I'll implement the BOM check as described, handling UTF-8, UTF-16 BE, and UTF-16 LE BOMs. Then, if a BOM is found, use that charset and do not check the meta tags. If no BOM is found, proceed with the original logic of decoding with default charset and checking meta tags.\n\nI think this should fix the issue where the presence of a BOM causes incorrect decoding.\n</think>\n\n```java\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        boolean bomFound = false;\n        // Check for UTF-8 BOM\n        if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-8 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If not found, check for UTF-16 BOMs\n        if (!bomFound && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-16 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            charsetName = defaultCharset;\n        }\n\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            // Proceed to check meta tags\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n            Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n            if (meta != null) { \n                String foundCharset = null;\n                if (meta.hasAttr(\"http-equiv\")) {\n                    foundCharset = getCharsetFromContentType(meta.attr(\"content\"));\n                    if (foundCharset == null && meta.hasAttr(\"charset\")) {\n                        try {\n                            if (Charset.isSupported(meta.attr(\"charset\"))) {\n                                foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                            }\n                        } catch (IllegalCharsetNameException e) {\n                            foundCharset = null;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                }\n\n                if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.isEmpty() && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                    foundCharset = foundCharset.trim().replaceAll(\"[\\\"']\", \"\");\n                    charsetName = foundCharset;\n                    byteData.rewind();\n                    docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                    doc = null;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n[Semantic Equivalence Test Results]: \nAST-based validation: AST validation failed with error: Invalid hex float literal at \" \", line 6: The suggested fix is to check for the BOM in the byte data before decoding.

Core Functionality and Behavior\n- **Buggy Code:** Decodes with default charset, parses, detects charset from meta, re-decodes if needed, then checks for BOM in the decoded string and re-decodes again. Flawed BOM handling in decoded string.\n- **Ground Truth Patch:** Similar to buggy code, but adds `doc = null;` after BOM re-decode to force re-parsing. Fixes the immediate issue by re-parsing with potentially corrected charset after BOM detection in string.\n- **Generated Patch:** Detects UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE BOMs in byte data *before* decoding. Sets charset based on BOM, skips BOM bytes, and decodes. If no BOM, uses default charset and meta tag detection. More robust and efficient BOM handling.\n\nBehavioral Differences:\n- **BOM Detection Timing:** Generated patch detects BOM at byte level *before* decoding. Ground truth and buggy code detect BOM in decoded string *after* initial decode.\n- **Re-parsing on BOM:** Ground truth re-parses if BOM is detected in string. Generated patch avoids re-parse by handling BOM upfront.\n- **BOM Handling Robustness:** Generated patch handles BOMs more correctly at byte level.

While both patches likely fix the trigger test and address the core issue of incorrect BOM handling, they do so in different ways, leading to behavioral differences.\n\nThe ground truth patch makes a minimal, targeted change to fix the immediate bug by ensuring a re-parse occurs when a BOM is detected in the decoded string. This approach is less robust and less efficient as it involves an initial potentially incorrect decode and parse, followed by a re-decode and re-parse.\n\nThe generated patch, on the other hand, implements a more comprehensive and correct BOM handling strategy by detecting BOMs at the byte level *before* any decoding. This is semantically a better approach to BOM handling and likely more robust in various scenarios. However, this difference in approach leads to the patches not being semantically equivalent. The generated patch represents a more significant refactoring of the BOM handling logic compared to the minimal fix in the ground truth patch.\n\nDespite the generated patch being arguably a superior solution, the semantic equivalence tests and the analysis of behavioral differences indicate that it is not semantically equivalent to the ground truth patch. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is PLAUSIBLE, as it fixes the core issue and is likely correct in most practical scenarios, but exhibits behavioral differences compared to the ground truth patch.\n\nFinal Answer: **PLAUSIBLE**",

        "generated_patch": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the bug in the provided Java function. The root cause is that the function doesn't handle the Byte Order Mark (BOM) correctly when the charset isn't specified. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function currently tries to detect the charset from the HTML meta tags when charsetName is null. But if the byte data starts with a BOM, the initial decoding using the default charset (probably UTF-8) might include the BOM as the first character, which is '\\ufeff'. However, the current code checks for this BOM in the decoded string and tries to re-decode, but this might not be sufficient because the initial decoding could have already messed up the data.\n\nThe suggested fix is to check for the BOM in the byte data before decoding. That makes sense because the BOM is a specific byte sequence. For example, UTF-8 BOM is the bytes 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF. But in the code, the check is for a single byte 0xFEFF, which is actually the UTF-16 BOM. Wait, no, in the code, it's checking if the first byte is 0xFEFF, which is actually incorrect because in Java, a ByteBuffer's get() returns a byte, which is a signed 8-bit value. 0xFEFF as a byte would be -1, but that's not the correct way to check for BOMs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The BOM for UTF-8 is the bytes EF BB BF. So in the ByteBuffer, the first three bytes should be checked. But the initial code in the suggestion only checks if the first byte is 0xFEFF, which is actually the Unicode code point for the BOM, but as a single 16-bit value. That approach is incorrect because in UTF-8, the BOM is three bytes, not one.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial suggestion is flawed. But the main idea is to skip the BOM before decoding. So I need to adjust the code to correctly handle the BOM.\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with the default charset, it checks if the first character is 65279, which is the BOM's Unicode code point. So if the BOM is present, it redecodes using the default charset and skips the first character. But the problem arises when the initial decoding is incorrect because the BOM was not skipped, leading to wrong parsing.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check for the BOM in the byte data before decoding. But how to do that correctly?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. When charsetName is null, before decoding, check if the byte data starts with a BOM.\n2. If a BOM is present, skip those bytes and note the charset implied by the BOM.\n3. Then decode the rest of the data using that charset, or proceed with detecting from meta tags.\n\nBut wait, the BOM indicates the encoding. So if a BOM is present, we should use the corresponding charset instead of the default.\n\nHowever, the original code's approach is to decode with the default charset, then check for BOM in the string. That's not reliable because if the default charset is not matching the BOM's charset, the decoding could be wrong.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n- Check the byte data for a BOM.\n- If found, determine the charset from the BOM and decode using that charset.\n- If not found, proceed to detect the charset from the meta tags.\n\nBut how do I check for the BOM in the byte data?\n\nLet me think about the possible BOMs:\n\n- UTF-8 BOM: EF BB BF\n- UTF-16 BE BOM: FE FF\n- UTF-16 LE BOM: FF FE\n- UTF-32 BE BOM: 00 00 FE FF\n- UTF-32 LE BOM: FF FE 00 00\n\nBut handling all of them might complicate the code. Alternatively, perhaps the code should check for the presence of any BOM and then adjust the decoding accordingly.\n\nBut in the context of HTML parsing, the most common BOMs are UTF-8, UTF-16 BE, and UTF-16 LE.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should check for these BOMs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check if the byte data starts with any known BOM and then adjust the charset accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the original code, the default charset is used when charsetName is null. So perhaps the initial decoding is done with the default charset, but if a BOM is present, it's better to adjust the charset based on the BOM.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first check for a BOM and, if present, decode using the appropriate charset, then proceed to check the meta tags.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the meta tags would override the BOM. According to HTML specs, the BOM takes precedence over the meta tag. So if a BOM is present, it should be used, and the meta tag should be ignored.\n\nWait, no. Actually, according to the HTML5 spec, the BOM is part of the encoding declaration, and it takes precedence over any meta tags or other declarations. So if a BOM is present, the encoding is determined by the BOM, and the meta tags are ignored.\n\nSo in the function, if a BOM is present, we should decode using the charset indicated by the BOM, without trying to detect from the meta tags.\n\nBut the original code's logic is to first decode with the default charset, then check for BOM in the string, which is not correct because the initial decoding may have already altered the data.\n\nSo, to fix this, the function should first check for a BOM in the byte data, determine the charset from it, and then decode the entire data with that charset, without trying to detect from the meta tags.\n\nBut wait, the original code is designed to detect the charset from the meta tags when charsetName is null. So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- If charsetName is null, first check for BOM in the byte data.\n- If BOM is found, decode using the corresponding charset, and do not check the meta tags.\n- If no BOM is found, proceed to decode with default charset, then check meta tags as before.\n\nBut that might complicate the code. Alternatively, perhaps the BOM check should be done regardless, and if found, use that charset, else proceed with meta detection.\n\nSo, let me think about the steps in the function:\n\n1. If charsetName is null:\n   a. Check byteData for BOM.\n   b. If BOM found, determine the charset and decode using it.\n   c. Else, decode with default charset, then check meta tags for charset.\n\nBut wait, in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks for BOM in the string. If found, it redecodes with default charset and skips the BOM. But that approach is flawed because the initial decoding may have already misinterpreted the bytes.\n\nSo, to correctly handle BOM, the function should check the byte data for BOM before any decoding.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Modify the function to check for BOM in the byte data when charsetName is null.\n- If BOM is found, decode using the corresponding charset and do not proceed to check meta tags.\n- If no BOM is found, proceed with the original logic: decode with default charset, check meta tags, and possibly re-decode.\n\nBut how to implement the BOM check?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nWhen charsetName is null:\n\n- Check if byteData has at least 3 bytes remaining (for UTF-8 BOM).\n- If so, check the first 3 bytes for EF BB BF.\n- If found, set charsetName to UTF-8, skip the first 3 bytes, and decode the rest.\n- Else, check for UTF-16 BE BOM (FE FF). For this, need at least 2 bytes.\n- If found, set charsetName to UTF-16BE, skip 2 bytes, decode.\n- Else, check for UTF-16 LE BOM (FF FE). If found, set to UTF-16LE, skip 2 bytes.\n- Else, proceed with default charset.\n\nBut wait, handling all possible BOMs may complicate the code, but it's necessary for correctness.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can check for the presence of any BOM and then determine the charset accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps a more efficient way is to check for the most common BOMs.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n        byte[] bomBytes = new byte[3];\n        byteData.get(bomBytes);\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bomBytes[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            // UTF-8 BOM\n            charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n        } else {\n            // Put the bytes back into the buffer\n            byteData.put(bomBytes);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (charsetName == null && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bomBytes = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bomBytes);\n        if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            // UTF-16 BE BOM\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n        } else if (bomBytes[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bomBytes[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            // UTF-16 LE BOM\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n        } else {\n            byteData.put(bomBytes);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (charsetName == null) {\n        // No BOM found, use default charset\n        charsetName = defaultCharset;\n    }\n\n    // Now decode using charsetName\n    docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n    // Then, check if the decoded data starts with BOM (in case of UTF-8 with BOM but no bytes checked)\n    // Wait, no, because we already checked the byte data. So perhaps this step is unnecessary.\n\n    // But wait, in the original code, after decoding, it checks if the first character is BOM and redecodes. But if we've already handled the BOM in the byte data, this step is redundant.\n\n    // So perhaps we can remove that part.\n\n    // Then proceed to check meta tags as before, but only if charsetName is still defaultCharset?\n\n    // Wait, no. Because if we found a BOM, charsetName is set to that charset, and we shouldn't check meta tags.\n\n    // So perhaps after handling BOM, if charsetName is not defaultCharset, we don't need to check meta tags.\n\n    // So, the code would be:\n\n    if (charsetName != null && !charsetName.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n        // BOM was found, so we use this charset and don't check meta tags\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // Proceed to check meta tags\n        // ... existing code to check meta tags and possibly re-decode\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks for BOM in the string. So perhaps that part can be removed because we've already handled the BOM in the byte data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should still check for BOM in the string, but that might be redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first handle the BOM in the byte data, set the charset accordingly, and then proceed to decode. Then, the meta tag detection should only occur if no BOM was found.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nIn the case where charsetName is null:\n\n1. Check for BOM in byte data.\n2. If BOM found, set charsetName to the corresponding charset, skip the BOM bytes, decode the rest.\n3. If no BOM found, decode with default charset, then check meta tags for charset.\n4. If meta tag provides a charset, re-decode.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif (charsetName == null) {\n    // Check for BOM and set charsetName accordingly\n    boolean bomFound = false;\n    if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n        byteData.get(bom);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n            charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n            bomFound = true;\n        } else {\n            byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-8 BOM\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!bomFound && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n        byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n        byteData.get(bom);\n        if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n            bomFound = true;\n        } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n            charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n            byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n            bomFound = true;\n        } else {\n            byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-16 BOM\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!bomFound) {\n        charsetName = defaultCharset;\n    }\n\n    // Now decode\n    docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n    // If BOM was found, no need to check meta tags\n    if (bomFound) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    } else {\n        // Proceed to check meta tags as before\n        Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n        if (meta != null) {\n            // ... existing code to get foundCharset\n            if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                // re-decode\n                charsetName = foundCharset;\n                byteData.rewind();\n                docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                doc = null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // The original code had a check for BOM in the decoded string. Since we've already handled BOM in bytes, perhaps this is unnecessary.\n    // So, remove that part.\n\n    // Then, if doc is null, parse again\n    if (doc == null) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding with default charset, it checks if the first character is BOM and redecodes. But with the changes above, that part can be removed because we've already handled the BOM in the byte data.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, the part that checks for BOM in the decoded string can be removed.\n\nPutting it all together, the function would:\n\n- When charsetName is null, check for BOM in the byte data.\n- If BOM found, set charsetName and skip the BOM bytes.\n- Decode the data with charsetName.\n- If no BOM found, decode with default charset, then check meta tags for charset.\n- If meta tag provides a different charset, re-decode.\n- Remove the later check for BOM in the decoded string.\n\nSo, the fixed function would look like this:\n\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        boolean bomFound = false;\n        // Check for UTF-8 BOM\n        if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-8 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If not found, check for UTF-16 BOMs\n        if (!bomFound && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-16 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            charsetName = defaultCharset;\n        }\n\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            // Proceed to check meta tags\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n            Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n            if (meta != null) { \n                String foundCharset = null;\n                if (meta.hasAttr(\"http-equiv\")) {\n                    foundCharset = getCharsetFromContentType(meta.attr(\"content\"));\n                    if (foundCharset == null && meta.hasAttr(\"charset\")) {\n                        try {\n                            if (Charset.isSupported(meta.attr(\"charset\"))) {\n                                foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                            }\n                        } catch (IllegalCharsetNameException e) {\n                            foundCharset = null;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                }\n\n                if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.isEmpty() && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                    foundCharset = foundCharset.trim().replaceAll(\"[\\\"']\", \"\");\n                    charsetName = foundCharset;\n                    byteData.rewind();\n                    docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                    doc = null;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        }\n    } else { \n        Validate.notEmpty(charsetName, \"Must set charset arg to character set of file to parse. Set to null to attempt to detect from HTML\");\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n    }\n\n    if (doc == null) {\n        doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n        doc.outputSettings().charset(charsetName);\n    }\n\n    return doc;\n}\n\nWait, but in the original code, after decoding, there's a check for BOM in the string. I removed that part because we've already handled BOM in the byte data. So that part should be omitted.\n\nBut wait, what if the BOM is present but the initial check missed it? For example, if the BOM is for UTF-32 or another encoding. But handling all possible BOMs might complicate the code beyond the scope. So perhaps the initial fix should handle the most common BOMs and leave the rest as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check for any BOM and adjust accordingly, but that might require more extensive changes.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the issue is that the function doesn't handle the BOM when charset is null. So the fix should address that by checking for BOM in the byte data before decoding.\n\nSo, in the fixed function, I'll implement the BOM check as described, handling UTF-8, UTF-16 BE, and UTF-16 LE BOMs. Then, if a BOM is found, use that charset and do not check the meta tags. If no BOM is found, proceed with the original logic of decoding with default charset and checking meta tags.\n\nI think this should fix the issue where the presence of a BOM causes incorrect decoding.\n</think>\n\n```java\nstatic Document parseByteData(ByteBuffer byteData, String charsetName, String baseUri, Parser parser) {\n    String docData;\n    Document doc = null;\n    if (charsetName == null) { \n        boolean bomFound = false;\n        // Check for UTF-8 BOM\n        if (byteData.remaining() >= 3) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[3];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xEF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xBB && bom[2] == (byte) 0xBF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-8\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 3);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-8 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If not found, check for UTF-16 BOMs\n        if (!bomFound && byteData.remaining() >= 2) {\n            byte[] bom = new byte[2];\n            byteData.get(bom);\n            if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFE && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFF) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16BE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else if (bom[0] == (byte) 0xFF && bom[1] == (byte) 0xFE) {\n                charsetName = \"UTF-16LE\";\n                byteData.position(byteData.position() + 2);\n                bomFound = true;\n            } else {\n                byteData.put(bom); // put back if not UTF-16 BOM\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            charsetName = defaultCharset;\n        }\n\n        docData = Charset.forName(charsetName).decode(byteData).toString();\n\n        if (!bomFound) {\n            // Proceed to check meta tags\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);\n            Element meta = doc.select(\"meta[http-equiv=content-type], meta[charset]\").first();\n            if (meta != null) { \n                String foundCharset = null;\n                if (meta.hasAttr(\"http-equiv\")) {\n                    foundCharset = getCharsetFromContentType(meta.attr(\"content\"));\n                    if (foundCharset == null && meta.hasAttr(\"charset\")) {\n                        try {\n                            if (Charset.isSupported(meta.attr(\"charset\"))) {\n                                foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                            }\n                        } catch (IllegalCharsetNameException e) {\n                            foundCharset = null;\n                        }\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    foundCharset = meta.attr(\"charset\");\n                }\n\n                if (foundCharset != null && !foundCharset.isEmpty() && !foundCharset.equals(defaultCharset)) {\n                    foundCharset = foundCharset.trim().replaceAll(\"[\\\"']\", \"\");\n                    charsetName = foundCharset;\n                    byteData.rewind();\n                    docData = Charset.forName(foundCharset).decode(byteData).toString();\n                    doc = null;\n                }\n            }\n        } else {\n            doc = parser.parseInput(docData, baseUri);",
