        "reasoning_steps": "Step 1: Analyzing Bug Context\nFirst, let's understand the buggy function and its intended behavior. The function `getNumericalMean` is supposed to calculate the mean of a hypergeometric distribution given the population size `N`, number of successes `m`, and sample size `n`. The formula used is `n * m / N`, which mathematically seems correct for calculating the mean of such a distribution. The trigger test `testMath1021` creates a `HypergeometricDistribution` object with specific values for `N`, `m`, and `n`, and then samples from this distribution 100 times, checking if the sampled value is within the expected range (0 to `n`). The error message `junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: sample=-50` indicates that the sample value of `-50` is outside of this range, which is a clear violation of the expected behavior of a hypergeometric distribution.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Root Causes\nGiven the error message and the context of the bug, the issue seems to arise not directly from the `getNumericalMean` function itself but rather from how the sampling within the `HypergeometricDistribution` behaves. The formula for the mean (`n * m / N`) is mathematically correct and should not directly cause a sample to be negative. However, the error indicates a deeper issue possibly related to integer overflow or underflow, or an incorrect calculation within the distribution's sampling method that uses the mean as part of its logic. Since the sample size `n` and the number of successes `m` are both positive integers, and the population size `N` is also a positive integer, the mean should theoretically always be a non-negative number. The fact that a negative sample value `-50` was produced suggests that the calculation might be exceeding the bounds of integer storage, resulting in an overflow which then incorrectly influences the sampling logic, leading to an invalid (negative) sample value.\n\nStep 3: Suggesting Repairs\nSuggestion 1: Check for Integer Overflow\nEnsure that the calculation within the `getNumericalMean` or any related sampling method does not cause an integer overflow. This can be done by explicitly casting operands to `double` before performing operations, which is already done in the provided code snippet. However, reviewing related calculations in the sampling method for similar issues is crucial.\n\nSuggestion 2: Validate Calculation Logic in Sampling Method\nReview the logic within the sampling method of the `HypergeometricDistribution` to ensure it correctly handles the mean and other calculations. Any part of the code that relies on the mean or involves arithmetic operations should be carefully checked for potential mistakes that could lead to negative values.\n\nSuggestion 3: Add Boundary Checks\nBefore returning a sample value, add boundary checks to ensure that the value is within the expected range (0 to `n`). If the calculation somehow still results in an invalid value, the method could either throw an informative error or retry the calculation, depending on the context and performance considerations.",
        "final_solution": "{\n    \"title\": \"Final Detailed Solution\",\n    \"content\": {\n        \"Root Cause\": \"The root cause of the issue appears to be related to how the sampling method within the `HypergeometricDistribution` class handles calculations, potentially leading to integer overflow or incorrect arithmetic operations that result in a negative sample value. The error message `junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: sample=-50` suggests that the sample value is unexpectedly negative, which should not occur given the nature of hypergeometric distribution. The `getNumericalMean` function itself uses a correct formula (`n * m / N`), but the issue likely lies in how this mean or related calculations are used within the sampling logic, leading to an invalid output.\",\n        \"Suggestion 1\": \"Review and Correct Sampling Logic\\nEnsure that the sampling method within the `HypergeometricDistribution` class correctly implements the hypergeometric distribution's sampling algorithm. This includes verifying that all arithmetic operations are correctly performed, especially those involving large numbers that could lead to integer overflow. Using `double` or `long` for intermediate calculations might prevent overflow issues.\",\n        \"Suggestion 2\": \"Implement Boundary Checks in Sampling Method\\nAdd explicit boundary checks within the sampling method to ensure that the returned sample value is always within the valid range (0 to `n`). If a calculation results in a value outside this range, the method should handle this gracefully, either by retrying the calculation, returning a predefined safe value, or throwing an exception with a clear error message.\",\n        \"Suggestion 3\": \"Use BigDecimal for High-Precision Calculations\\nFor operations that involve large numbers or require high precision, consider using `BigDecimal` instead of `double` or `int`. This can help avoid issues related to floating-point arithmetic and integer overflow, ensuring that calculations are accurate and within expected bounds.\"\n    },\n    \"next_action\": \"final_answer\"\n}",
