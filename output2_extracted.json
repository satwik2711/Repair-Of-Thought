    "Root Cause: The `getNumericalMean` function itself seems correct in its calculation, but if used improperly elsewhere in the sampling logic, it could lead to invalid sampling results. The error could arise during the initialization or sampling logic that involves underflow, overflow, or incorrect conversions leading to negative sample values.\n\n### Patch Suggestions:\n\n####": [
      "Review Sampling Logic\nIf the mean calculation is used to drive sampling, ensure that any calculations using it are correctly handling the range of possible values. The bug might originate in how sampling is performed or in adjustments that involve mean calculations. This isn't directly related to `getNumericalMean`, so fix might involve reviewing another part of the code.\n\n####",
      "Ensure Correct Integer Arithmetic\nIf the mean is being used in integer arithmetic somewhere which could cause underflow or overflow, ensure that all arithmetic operations are being correctly managed with proper casting to avoid such issues.\n\n####",
      "Validate Precondition Assumptions\nVerify and adjust any assumptions used in the function or the broader class regarding input values or other parameters that might be affected when the population size (`N`) or number of successes (`m`) are very close, potentially leading to division issues or unexpected distribution behavior.\n\n####",
      "Implement Additional Range Checks\nAdd additional checks or assertions in the logic that uses this function to ensure that calculations do not exceed boundaries that could lead to negative results. This might involve modifying constraints or adding exceptions when unexpected results occur.\n\nThese suggestions focus on identifying potential logic or arithmetic issues outside the `getNumericalMean` itself that may be causing the negative sample values."
