    "The function `getNumericalMean()` is supposed to calculate the mean of a hypergeometric distribution. The formula being used is correct in its intended form: `n * m / N`, where `n` is the sample size, `m` is the number of successes, and `N` is the population size. However, the computation `(double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize()` may result in integer overflow because `getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()` is calculated before the type casting to `double`. When `n * m` is large enough, it can exceed the maximum value representable by an `int`, resulting in incorrect values when the division is performed.\n\n###": [
      "Correct the Order of Type Casting\nTo prevent integer overflow, ensure that each component of the calculation is cast to `double` before performing the multiplication and division:\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return ((double) getSampleSize() * (double) getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n```\n\n###",
      "Use Long for Intermediate Calculation\nIf the function is used in a context where very large values are common, consider using `long` for intermediate computations to avoid integer overflow:\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return ((double) ((long) getSampleSize() * (long) getNumberOfSuccesses())) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n```\n\n###",
      "Direct Calculation with Increased Precision\nUse a method that increases precision by handling the calculation using `BigDecimal` if the precision issues persist due to the large values of `n`, `m`, and `N`:\n\n```java\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\n\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    BigDecimal sampleSize = BigDecimal.valueOf(getSampleSize());\n    BigDecimal numberOfSuccesses = BigDecimal.valueOf(getNumberOfSuccesses());\n    BigDecimal populationSize = BigDecimal.valueOf(getPopulationSize());\n\n    BigDecimal mean = sampleSize.multiply(numberOfSuccesses)\n                                .divide(populationSize, MathContext.DECIMAL128);\n    return mean.doubleValue();\n}\n```\n\nThese suggestions handle the issue in different ways, each suited to specific circumstances based on the expected range of input values. Select the solution that best fits your application's needs, considering performance and resource constraints."
