    "solutions": [
      "To address the issue, we need to understand both the trigger test and the error message, followed by analyzing the root cause in the buggy function.\n\n### Analysis of Trigger Test and Error Message:\n\n- **Trigger Test**: The test involves creating a `HypergeometricDistribution` with a large population size `N = 43130568`, number of successes `m = 42976365`, and sample size `n = 50`. The test samples 100 times from this distribution and asserts that the samples are within the range `[0, n]`. \n\n- **Error Message**: The test fails with an `AssertionFailedError`, indicating a sample value of `-50`, which is clearly outside the expected range `[0, 50]`.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis:\n\nRoot Cause: The formula used to calculate the mean in the `getNumericalMean()` function may produce incorrect results due to integer overflow before the conversion to `double`. The product `getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()` is computed using integer arithmetic, which can overflow before being cast to `double`, leading to incorrect results. This influences further calculations, possibly causing the distribution to generate negative samples.\n\n### Patch Suggestions:\n\n#### Suggestion 1: Correct Order of Operations to Prevent Overflow\nModify the function to perform multiplication in `double` to ensure operations do not overflow.\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return ((double) getSampleSize() * (double) getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n```\n\n**Description**: By explicitly casting `getSampleSize()` and `getNumberOfSuccesses()` to `double` before multiplication, the operation is safely executed in floating-point arithmetic, thus avoiding overflow.\n\n#### Suggestion 2: Use a Temporary Variable for Safe Casting\nIntroduce a temporary variable to store intermediate results in `double` to ensure safe arithmetic operations.\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    double sampleSize = (double) getSampleSize();\n    double numberOfSuccesses = (double) getNumberOfSuccesses();\n    double populationSize = (double) getPopulationSize();\n    return (sampleSize * numberOfSuccesses) / populationSize;\n}\n```\n\n**Description**: By assigning each component to a `double` variable before performing arithmetic operations, this ensures that the operations are safely handled in floating-point, avoiding any integer overflow issues.\n\n#### Suggestion 3: Use Long Integers for Intermediate Computation\nConvert intermediate calculations to use `long` to handle larger integer values before final conversion to `double`.\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    long sampleSize = (long) getSampleSize();\n    long numberOfSuccesses = (long) getNumberOfSuccesses();\n    long populationSize = (long) getPopulationSize();\n    return ((double) (sampleSize * numberOfSuccesses)) / (double) populationSize;\n}\n```\n\n**Description**: Calculating the product in `long` helps handle larger values without overflow, then converting to `double` ensures precision in the final result.\n\nThese suggestions aim to eliminate the integer overflow issue by either using floating-point arithmetic from the start or by safely handling large integer values before converting to `double`."
