      "// Provide a fix for the buggy function.\nRoot cause: The formula used to calculate the mean in the `getNumericalMean()` function may produce incorrect results due to integer overflow before the conversion to `double`. The product `getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()` is computed using integer arithmetic, which can overflow before being cast to `double`, leading to incorrect results. This influences further calculations, possibly causing the distribution to generate negative samples.\n\n### Patch Suggestions:\n\n####\nSuggestion: Correct Order of Operations to Prevent Overflow\nModify the function to perform multiplication in `double` to ensure operations do not overflow.\n\n```java\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return ((double) getSampleSize() * (double) getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n```\n\n**Description**: By explicitly casting `getSampleSize()` and `getNumberOfSuccesses()` to `double` before multiplication, the operation is safely executed in floating-point arithmetic, thus avoiding overflow.\n\n####\n// Buggy Function\npublic double getNumericalMean() {\n    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();\n}\n// Fixed Function",
